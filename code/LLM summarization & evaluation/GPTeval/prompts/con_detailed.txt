You will be given one prediction article and one reference article.

Your task is to rate the prediction on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Consistency (1-5) - the factual alignment between the prediction and the reference. A factually consistent prediction contains only statements that are entailed by the reference. Annotators were also asked to penalize predictions that contained hallucinated facts. 

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the reference carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents.
2. Read the prediction and compare it to the reference. Check if the prediction contains any factual errors that are not supported by the reference.
3. Assign a score for consistency based on the Evaluation Criteria.

Here is a example of input and output you can follow.
Reference:

I LOVE YOU.

Prediction:

I LOVE YOU.
