You will be given one prediction article and one reference article.

Your task is to rate the prediction on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Relevance (1-5) - selection of important content from the source. The prediction should include only important information from the reference. Annotators were instructed to penalize predictions which contained redundancies and excess information.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the prediction and the reference carefully.
2. Compare the prediction to the reference and identify the main points of the reference.
3. Assess how well the prediction covers the main points of the reference, and how much irrelevant or redundant information it contains.
4. Assign a relevance score from 1 to 5.

Here is a example of input and output you can follow.
