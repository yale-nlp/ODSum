Not all the small buttons , you don't know project manager: Is this positive or negative , that  big buttons ? industrial designer: Big buttons , positive . industrial designer: All all small buttons like when you have  like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . What are your experiences ? user interface:  well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And  I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED   a LED on the corner of the of the remote . And that if you push the button the LED  gives a light , and  and you see that it's working .  project manager: So and do they always have that ? user interface: Yeah , but No no no . marketing:  at home we have a T_V_ , a video  recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . But  i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? industrial designer: The weight . industrial designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some  some sort of bleep . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah I think it  from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . So you don't won't have to change the batteries  once a week or  once every two weeks
