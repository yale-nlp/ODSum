        "Query": "What were the Professor's thoughts on the results and clustering in language generation?",
        "Summary": "Summary:\nThe professor expressed surprise at the better-than-expected results and concluded that MSG had no impact. However, he observed that the inclusion of French and Spanish in the multilingual English model had a negative effect. The professor was not enthusiastic about clustering and suggested giving more weight to the most promising bands in the model. Currently, the model treated all bands equally. In terms of the SmartKom generation module, the syntax-to-prosody rules for English will be rewritten, and OGI will provide a variety of synthesizer voices to choose from.",
        "Article": "grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right <doc-sep>grad d:  grad e: What does your thing say on the back ? grad d: Testing . grad f: Yeah , well , I g guess it 's coming up then , or grad d: Cuz it 's That starts counting from zero and these start counting from one . grad d: Your mike number is what we 're t grad e: Look at the back . grad d: Ho ! grad b: So grad d: I 've bested you again , Nancy . Damn ! Foiled again ! grad d: So is Keith showing up ? He 's talking with George right now .  , is he gonna get a rip  rip himself away from from that ? grad b: He 'll probably come later . grad d: Oh , then it 's just gonna be the five of us ? professor c: Yeah . grad e: Well , he he was very affirmative in his way of saying he will be here at four . So , Eva just reported she 's really happy about the CBT 's being in the same order in the XML as in the  be Java declaration format grad f: Yeah . The e grad e: so you don't have to do too much in the style sheet transversion . grad e: The  , Java the embedded Bayes wants to take input  , a Bayes - net in in some Java notation and Eva is using the Xalan style sheet processor to convert the XML that 's output by the Java Bayes for the into the , E Bayes input . grad f: Actually , maybe I could try , like , emailing the guy and see if he has any something already . grad f: That 'd be weird , that he has both the Java Bayes and the embedded Bayes in grad d: But that 's some sort of conversion program ? grad f: Yeah . grad e: And , well pretty mu pretty much on t on the top of my list , I would have asked Keith how the \" where is X ? \" hand parse is standing . grad d: So the trees for the XML trees for the for the gene for the synthesizer are written . Just gonna be you know professor c: Oh ! You were gonna send me a note about hiring grad e: Yes . grad e: OK , so natural language generation produces not a just a surface string that is fed into a text - to - speech but , a surface string with a syntax tree that 's fed into a concept - to - speech . grad e: Now and this concept - to - speech module has certain rules on how if you get the following syntactic structure , how to map this onto prosodic rules . grad e: And Fey has foolheartedly agreed to rewrite  , the German concept  syntax - to - prosody rules grad b: I didn't know she spoke German . And  therefore the ,  if it 's OK that we give her a couple of more hours per week , then she 'll do that . grad d: What language is that written i Is that that Scheme thing that you showed me ? grad e: Yeah . grad d: She knows how to program in Scheme ? I hope ? grad e: No , I My guess is I I asked for a commented version of that file ? If we get that , then it 's doable , even without getting into it , even though the Scheme li  , stuff is really well documented in the Festival . grad d: Well , I guess if you 're not used to functional programming , Scheme can be completely incomprehensible . But anyway , send me the note and then I 'll - I 'll check with , Morgan on the money . Oh , so this was You know , on the generation thing ,  if sh y she 's really going to do that , then we should be able to get prosody as well . grad d: Are we gonna Can we change the voice of the of the thing , because right now the voice sounds like a murderer . grad b: Wh - Which one ? grad d: The the little Smarticus Smarticus sounds like a murderer . grad e: It is  , we have the choice between the , usual Festival voices , which I already told the SmartKom people we aren't gonna use because they 're really bad . grad b: Festival ? professor c: It 's the name of some program , grad b: Oh , oh . grad e: OGI has , crafted a couple of diphone type voices that are really nice and we 're going to use that . grad d: Does OGI stand for ? Original German Institute ? professor c: Orego grad b: So . grad b: Oregon Graduate Insti professor c: Oregon @ @ Graduate Institute grad d: Oh . professor c: It turns out there 's the long - standing links with these guys in the speech group . professor c: In fact , there 's this guy who 's basically got a joint appointment , Hynek Hermansky . And it 's probably also absolutely uninteresting for all of you to ,  learn that as of twenty minutes ago , David and I , per accident ,  managed to get the whole SmartKom system running on the  , ICSI Linux machines with the ICSI NT machines thereby increasing the number of running SmartKom systems in this house from one on my laptop to three . grad e: I suggested to try something that was really kind of even though against better knowledge shouldn't have worked , but it worked . grad b: Will it work again , grad e: Maybe maybe maybe a bit for the AI i intuition thing . It - it 's just like why why the generation ma the presentation manager is now working ? grad a:  ! This is something you ha you get used to as a programmer , right ? grad e: Which grad a: You know , and it 's cool , it works out that way . So , the the people at Saarbruecken and I decided not to touch it ever again . grad a: What what thing is this ? grad e: Where is X ? grad a: OK . grad e: Oh , but by  , we can ask , did you get to read all four hundred words ? professor c: I did . That professor c: You know , i Yeah , it grad d: Each paragraph is good , though . grad b: Yeah , I didn't know about it until Robert told me , like ,  professor c: Yeah , I I ra I ran across it in I don't even know where , you know some just some weird place . And , yeah , I I 'm surprised I didn't know about it grad b: Y yeah . I was like , why didn't Dan tell me ? professor c: since we know all the invited speakers , an grad a: Right . Before we get started on this st so I also had a nice email correspondence with Daphne Kohler , who said yes indeed she would love to work with us on the , you know , using these structured belief - nets and stuff but starting in August , that she 's also got a new student working on this and that we should get in touch with them again in August and then we 'll figure out a way for you  you to get seriously connected with ,  their group . So ,  And it looks to me like we 're now at a good point to do something start working on something really hard . grad a: Oh ! professor c: w Which is mental spaces and  and - or grad a:  ! grad b: It 's hard . But the other part of it is the way they connect to these , probabilistic relational models . So there 's all the problems that the linguists know about , about mental spaces , and the cognitive linguists know about , but then there 's this problem of the belief - net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief - nets . professor c: So there 's a term \" dynamic belief - net \" , doesn't mean that . But one of the things I w would like to do over the next , month , it may take more , is to st understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple worlds and  sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences . So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff , so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate  , belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate . But that 's g that 's , as far as I can tell , it 's it 's putting together two real hard problems . One is the linguistic part of what are the couplings and and when you have a certain , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , you know , between let 's say between the past and the present , or any other one of these things and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work if it 's got  , let 's say one in in , you know , different tenses or my beliefs and your beliefs , or any of these other ones of of multiple models . So  you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both , in a way we that , you know , th hopefully turns out to be consistent , so that the  . But anyway , so that 's ,  grad a: Oh yeah , like  , I solved the the problem of  we were talking about how do you various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote \" count as a noun phrase \" , you know , occur as an argument of a higher construction , but a bare singular stem doesn't get to act that way . grad a: and it would take a really long time to explain it now , but I 'm about to write it up this evening . I solved that at the same time as \" how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase \" to get something like \" I the kicked dog \" . No , I know , I th I I think that is gonna be sort of the key to this wh to th the big project of the summer of of getting the constructions right is that people do manage to do this so there probably are some , relatively clean rules , they 're just not context - free trees . professor c: And if we if the formalism is is good , then we should be able to have , you know , sort of moderate scale thing . And that by the way is is , Keith , what I encouraged George to be talking with you about . professor c: The p And Oh , another thing ,  there was this ,  thing that Nancy agreed to in a in a weak moment this morning that grad a:  ! grad b: I was really strong . professor c: Anyway , that we were that we 're gonna try to get a  , first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week . professor c: just trying to write up essentially what what you guys have worked out so that everybody has something to look at . We 've talked about it , but only the innermost inner group currently , grad a:   grad a: There 's The group as a whole knows but no individual member kno professor c: Well that that yeah th there 's one of the advantages of a document , right ? , grad a: Yeah . Anyway , so , with a little luck  l let 's , let 's have that as a goal anyway . grad a: So , what was the date there ? professor c: And grad a: Monday or ? It 's a Friday . grad b: But , but but the two of us will probably talk to you at well before th grad a: I thought you said beginning of n Yeah . Anyway , w let 's talk separately about how t grad a: Yeah , I have a busy weekend but after that Yeah , gung - ho . grad a: Great , professor c: Now if it turns out that that effort leads us into some big hole that 's fine . There 's a really hard problem we haven't solved yet that , that 's just fine . grad a: But at at least sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now . professor c: Right , t t if to the extent that we have it , let 's write it grad a: OK . professor c: and to the extent we don't , let 's find out what we need to do . professor c: So ,  grad e: Can we ? Is it worth thinking of an example out of our tourism thing domain , that involves a a a decent mental space shift or setting up professor c: I think it is , but  but I interrupted before Keith got to tell us what happened with \" where is the Powder - Tower ? \" or whatever grad b: Right .  , what was supposed to happen ? I 've sort of been actually caught up in some other ones , so , you know , I don't have a write - up of or I haven't elaborated on the ideas that we were already talking about which were grad e: yeah . I think I think we already came to the conclusion that we have two alternative paths that we two alternative ways of representing it . grad e:  grad a: The question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . grad a: so d ' you Is it clear what we 're talking about here ? grad b: I agree . grad a: The question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for path . grad e: It 's grad a:  or or whether the construction semantically , is clearly only asking for location grad e: Should we have a a a grad b:  grad a: but pragmatically that 's construed as meaning \" tell me how to get there \" . grad e: So assume these are two , nodes we can observe in the Bayes - net . grad e: So these are either true or false and it 's also just true or false . If we encounter a phrase such as \" where is X ? \" , should that set this to true and this to true , and the Bayes - net figures out which under the c situation in general is more likely ?  , or should it just activate this , have this be false , and the Bayes - net figures out whether this actually now means ? professor c:  w that 's a s grad b: Slightly different . professor c: So I a I I th I agree with you that , it 's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every  , pragmatic reading , grad a:   professor c: there there 's some that grad b: Or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications of the same one . But , you know , c  almost certainly \" can you pass the salt \" is a construction worth noting that there is this th this this this  grad a: Yeah . Is it is it like that or is it just sort of obvious from world knowledge that no one you wouldn't want to know the location without wanting to know how to get there or whatever . grad e: One Or in some cases , it 's it 's quite definitely professor c: Yeah . Well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ? professor c: Exactly . professor c: And I guess , see , the more important thing at this stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it in ei f in the short run it 's more important to know how we would treat technically what we would do if we decided A and what we would do if we decided B , than it is t to decide A or B r right now . professor c: So I guess In the short run , let 's let 's be real clear on h what the two alternatives would be . grad e: And then the we had another idea floating around  , which we wanted to , get your input on , and that concerns the But the nice thing is w we would have a person that would like to work on it , and that 's Ir - Irina Gurevich from EML who is going to be visiting us , the week before , August and a little bit into August .  , and one of the reas one of the those ideas was , so , back to the old Johno observation that if y if you have a dialogue history and it said the word \" admission fee \" was  , mentioned  , it 's more likely that the person actually wants to enter than just take a picture of it from the outside . Now what could imagine to , you know , have a list for each construction of things that one should look up in the discourse history , yeah ? That 's the really stupid way . Then there is the really clever way that was suggested by Keith and then there is the , middle way that I 'm suggesting and that is you you get X , which is whatever , the castle . The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours , that they have admission fees , they have whatever . And then , this is We go via a thesaurus and look up certain linguistic surface structures that are related to these concepts and feed those through the dialogue history and check dynamically for each e entity . We look it up check whether any of these were mentioned and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse side . But Keith suggested that a a much cleaner way would be is , you know , to keep track of the discourse in such a way that you if you know that something like that ha has been mentioned before , this just a continues to add up , you know , in th in a grad a: So if someone mentions admission f fees , that activates an Enter schema which sticks around for a little while in your rep in the representation of what 's being talked about . And then when someone asks \" where is X ? \" you 've already got the the Enter schema activated grad b: Kind of a priming professor c:   professor c:  grad d: Well , is it doesn't it seem like if you just managed the dialogue history with a a thread , that you know , kept track of ho of the activity of  , cuz it would the the thread would know what nodes like , needed to be activated , so it could just keep track of how long it 's been since something 's been mentioned , and automatically load it in . But here 's here 's a way in th in the bl Bayes - net you could you could think about it this way , that if  at the time \" admissions fee \" was mentioned you could increase the probability that someone wanted to enter . grad d: We - yeah th th that 's what I wa I wasn't I was I wasn't thinking in terms of Enter schemas . I was just professor c: Fair enough , OK , but , but , in terms of the c c the current implementation right ? so that  grad b: It would already be higher in the context . professor c: th that th the the the conditional probability that someone So at the time you mentioned it This is this is essentially the Bayes - net equivalent of the spreading activation . professor c: It 's In some ways it 's not as good but it 's the implementation we got . Now Now my guess is that it 's not a question of time but it is a question of whether another intervening object has been mentioned . professor c: we could look at dialo this is Of course the other thing we ha we do is , is we have this data coming grad a: Yeah . professor c: but but skipping that so so but my guess is what what 'll probably will happen , Here 's a here 's a proposed design . is that there 're certain constructions which , for our purposes do change the probabilities of EVA decisions and various other kinds and th that the , standard way that that the these contexts work is sort of stack - like or whatever , but that 's sort of the most recent thing . And so it could be that when another  , en tourist entity gets mentioned , you grad b: Renew professor c: re re essentially re - initiali you know , re - i essentially re - initialize the state . professor c: And of course i if we had a fancier one with multiple worlds you could have  , you could keep track of what someone was  saying about this and that . professor c: You know , \" I wanna go in the morning grad a: \" Here 's my plan for today . \" professor c: Yeah , or Yeah , in the morning morning I I 'm planning t to go shopping , grad a: hypothetically . professor c: tal so I 'm talking about shopping and then you say , you know , well ,  \" What 's it cost ? \" or something . professor c: But I do th think that the It 'll turn out that it 's gonna be depend pretty much on whether there 's been an override . grad e: Yeah , if if you ask \" how much does a train ride and and cinema around the vineyards cost ? \" and then somebody tells you it 's sixty dollars and then you say \" OK How much is ,  I would like to visit the \" whatever , something completely different , \" then I go to , you know , Point Reyes \" , professor c: Yeah . grad e: it it 's not more likely that you want to enter anything , but it 's , as a matter of fact , a complete rejection of entering by doing that . grad b: So when you admit have admission fee and it changes something , it 's only for that particular It 's relational , right ? It 's only for that particular object . Well , and and and the simple idea is that it 's on it 's only for m for the current  , tourist e entity of instre interest . But that 's  this this function , so , has the current object been mentioned in in with a question about concerning its professor c: No , no . Is When th When the this is mentioned , the  probability of of , let 's say , entering changes grad b: Of that object . grad d: You could just hav  , just basically , ob it It observes an er , it sets the a node for \" entered \" or \" true \" or something , professor c: Yeah . Now ,  But I think Ro - Robert 's right , that to determine that , OK ? you may well want to go through a th thesaurus grad d: \" discourse enter \" . professor c: and and So , if the issue is , if so now th this construction has been matched and you say \" OK . Does this actually have any implications for our decisions ? \" Then there 's another piece of code that presumably does that computation . professor c: But but what 's Robert 's saying is is , and I think he 's right , is you don't want to try to build into the construction itself all the synonyms and all you know , all the wo  maybe . Well , it 's just another , sort of , construction side is how to get at the possible inferences we can draw from the discourse history or changing of the probabilities , and - or grad b: Guess it 's like I g The other thing is , whether you have a m m user model that has , you know , whatever , a current plan , whatever , plans that had been discussed , and I don't know ,  grad d: What  , what 's the argument for putting it in the construction ? Is it just that the s synonym selection is better , or ? professor c: Oh , wel Well , the ar the The argument is that you 're gonna have the If you 've recognized the word , you 've recognized the word , which means you have a lexical construction for it , so you could just as well tag the lexical construction with the fact that it 's a  , you know , thirty percent increase in probability of entering . You So you could you could you could invert invert the whole thing , so you s you tag that information on to the lexicon grad d: Mmm . at at Yeah , and this is grad e: Even though  the lexical construction itself out out of context , won't do it . grad e: \" But I but I 'm not interested in the opening times \" is sort of a more a V type . But , we 'll   , we have time to This is a s just a sidetrack , but  I think it 's also something that people have not done before , is  , sort of abuse an ontology for these kinds of , inferences , on whether anything relevant to the current something has been  , has crept up in the dialogue history already , or not . And ,  I have the ,  If we wanted to have that function in the dialogue hi dialogue module of SmartKom , I have the written consent of Jan to put it in there . professor c: So the point is , it 's very likely that Robert 's thesis is going to be along these lines , grad b: Oh , s professor c: and the local rules are if it 's your thesis , you get to decide how it 's done . So if , you know if this is seriously , if this becomes part of your thesis , you can say , hey we 're gonna do it this way , that 's the way it 's done . So h he 's got a th he 's got a meet meeting in Germany with his thesis advisor .  , this is this is , speaking of hard problems , this is a very good time  , to start trying to make explicit where construal comes in and you know , where c where the construction per - se ends and where construal comes in , grad a:   But that 's part of what the f grad b: We have many jobs for you , Ro - Robert . professor c: is is because th it is gonna have implicit in it grad e: Was I ? In the room ? grad b: No , you weren't there on purpose . professor c: Yeah , that That 's the point , is is th grad a: Yeah . grad d: Yeah , but it he the decisions I made wer had to do with my thesis . So consequently don't I get to decide then that it 's Robert 's job ? professor c: No . grad b: Well , I 'll just pick a piece of the problem and then just push the hard stuff into the center and say it 's Robert 's . grad e: I 've always been completely in favor of consensus decisions , grad b: I can professor c: Right . professor c: not grad e: It it might even be interesting then to say that I should be forced to  , sort of pull some of the ideas that have been floating in my head out of the ,  out of the top hat professor c: Yes . grad e: Yes , and , it 's Ha - None of that is basically still around , grad b: I didn't get professor c: And a another draft OK . grad e: but it 's professor c: D i grad a: That 's normal . professor c: I i grad b: Oh , I guess it 's good I didn't read it . professor c: and grad e: Yeah , and I would like to d discuss it and , you know , get you guys 's input professor c: Right . professor c:  So that , so th thi this  , so this is the point , is we we 're going to have to cycle through this , grad a: Yeah . professor c: but th the draft of the p proposal on the constructions is is going to tell us a lot about what we think needs to be done by construal . grad b:  grad e: Meeting regular meeting time for the summer , we really haven't found one . It 's - it 's a coincidence that he can't do couldn't do it today here . professor c: And the NTL meeting moved to Wednesday , grad e: So professor c: cuz of of ,  grad e: Yeah , it was just an exception . professor c: Yeah , you weren't here , but but but s  , And so , if that 's OK with you , grad a: It 's i Is it staying basically at the Wednesday noon ? professor c: you would grad a: OK . How do we feel about doing it Wednesdays ? Because it seems to me that this is sort of a time where when we have things to discuss with other people , there they seem to be s tons of people around . professor c: The only disadvantage is that it may interfere with other grad e: Or subgroup meetings professor c: s you know , other other No , you  , people in this group connecting with with grad b: Those people who happen to be around . I I  you know I have no fixed grad a: To tell you the truth , I 'd rath I 'd , I 'd would like to avoid more than one ICSI meeting per day , if possible .  that grad e: The I 'd like to have them all in one day , grad a: Yeah , I can understand that . professor c: Well p grad e: so package them up and then professor c: people people differ in their tastes in this matter . I 'm always here anyway , grad e: It 's OK , that grad b: so It doesn't matter . grad e: Well , if one sort of thing is , this room is taken at after three - thirty pr pretty much every day by the data collection . grad e: So we just knew i grad b: So did you just say that Ami can't make one o ' grad e: No , he can . About the c the th grad b: Could we do Thursday at one - thirty ? Would that that be horrible ? grad e: No . grad b: Oh really ? grad e: Because , this room is again taken at two - thirty by Morgan . grad e: And the s meeting recorder meeting meeting meeting recording on meeting meetings grad b: OK , OK , OK . professor c: I I could grad b:  we usually meet Tuesday or l like , linguists  , at two . Do you want to meet again here bef grad d: And the s Is the Speech - Gen meeting still at on Tuesdays ? grad e:  w Well , actually we w we we did scrap our Monday time just because Bhaskara couldn't come Monday . grad a: That doesn't apply to a grad d: Although I thought you wanted to go camping on Monday er , take off Mondays a lot so you could go camping .  ! grad b: Well , the linguists ' meeting i happens to be at two , but I think that 's  . grad a: And , you know , of course Nancy and I are just sort of always talking anyway and sometimes we do it in that room . grad e: Monday ? professor c: OK , whate  What I think Robert 's saying is that grad a: Earlier in the week professor c: earlier we At least for next week , there 's a lot of stuff we want to get done , grad a:   grad b: At o o o o one , two , three ? grad e: One , two , three ? Three 's too late . professor c: Oh , I i Yeah , I actually Two is the earliest I can meet on Monday . professor c: Here I 'm blissfully agreeing to things and realizing that I actually do have some stuff scheduled on Monday . grad b: You guys will still remind me , right ? grad d: No way ! grad b: Y you 'll come and take all the the headph the good headphones first and then remind me . grad e: And grad b: Why do I have this unless I 'm gonna write ? grad e: do I get to see th  , your formalism before that ? grad b: Fine . grad e: I wo I would like I would sort of get a get a notion of what what you guys have in store for me . professor c: Well m @ @ you know , w maybe Mond - Maybe we can put This is part of what we can do Monday , if we want . grad b: Yeah , so there was like , you know , m m in my head the goal to have like an intermediate version , like , everything I know . grad b: And then , w I would talk to you and figure out everything you know , that you know , see if they 're consistent . Why don't w Maybe you and I should meet sort of more or less first thing Monday morning and then we can work on this . I might I might  , grad e: You - y grad b: s You said you 're busy over th until the weekend , right ? grad a: Yeah , sort of through the weekend because Kate has a photography show . So , maybe I 'll send you some grad a: if you have time after this I 'll show you the noun phrase thing . OK , and we 'll You wanna m grad e: So the idea is on Monday at two we 'll we 'll see an intermediate version of the formalism for the constructions , grad a: Yeah . grad b: So that 's OK for you grad e: and do an on - line merging with my construal ideas . grad e: So it won't be , like , a for semi - formal presentation of my proposal . grad b: Cuz then you 'll find out more of what we 're making you do . Can you also write it up ? grad b: It 's like , \" this is what we 're doing . \" grad e: I 'll I 'll send you I 'll I 'll send you a style file , right ? grad b: OK . grad e: You just grad b: I already sent you my fi my bib file . grad a: Someday we also have to we should probably talk about the other side of the \" where is X \" construction , which is the issue of , how do you simulate questions ? What does the simspec look like for a question ? grad e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah , now , we we w grad a: We had to we had an idea for this which seemed like it would probably work . I professor c: OK ? So let 's think of a name for for whatever the this intermediate structure is . Oh , we talked about semspec , for \" semantic spec specification \" grad a: Mmm . grad a: It 's more general professor c: You know , so it 's a m minimal change . professor c: Right , a little substi substi You know , that 's what text substitution  macros are for . professor c: Anyway , so let 's let 's for the moment call it that until we think of something better . professor c: And , yeah , we absolutely need to find Part of what was missing were markings of all sorts that weren't in there , incl including the questions grad a:   professor c: We didn't we never did figure out how we were gonna do emphasis in in  , the semspec . grad b: Yeah , we 've talked a little bit about that , too , which  , it 's hard for me to figure out with sort of our general linguistic issues , how they map onto this particular one , grad a: Yeah . professor c: But that 's part of the formalism is got to be  , how things like that get marked . grad b: W do you have data , like the the You have preliminary data ? Cuz I know , you know , we 've been using this one easy sentence and I 'm sure you guys have  , maybe you are the one who 've been looking at the rest of it grad a: I grad b: it 'd it 'd be useful for me , if we want to have it a little bit more data oriented . grad a: To tell you the truth , what I 've been looking at has not been the data so far , grad b: Yeah . grad a: I just sort of said \" alright let 's see if I can get noun phrases and , major verb co  , constructions out of the way first . grad a: So , I have not really approached a lot of the data , but  obviously like these the the question one , since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that , you know , I ca can try and ,  run with that , you know , try and do some of the sentence constructions now . grad a: Oh yeah , the basic idea is that  ,  you know  , let 's see if I can formulate this . grad e: So you perform the mental sum and then , you know , \" who fixed the car with a wrench ? \" You basically are told , to to do this In the in analogously to the way you would do \" someone fixed the car with a wrench \" . And then you hand it back to your hippocampus and find out what that , you know , grad a: Means . grad a: The WH question has this as sort of extra thing which says \" and when you 're done , tell me who fills that slot \" or w you know . And , you know , this is sort of a nice way to do it , the idea of sort of saying that you treat from the simulation point of view or whatever you treat , WH constructions similarly to  , indefinite pronouns like \" someone fixed the car \" because lots of languages , have WH questions with an indefinite pronoun in situ or whatever , grad b: Use actually the same one . So it makes sense professor c: Alright , which is grad a:  professor c: Skolemization . professor c: In in logic , it 's it 's @ @ it 's actual Huh ? grad b: Right . professor c: That - that 's not that 's not saying it 's bad , grad a: Right . Anyway , but just that kind of thing and we 'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on , but professor c: Good . We sort of just dropped that cuz it was too weird and we didn't even know , like , what we were talking about exactly , what the object of study was . Well , if if  , i part of of what the exercise is , t by the end of next week , is to say what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet . grad e: Well , if you if you do wanna discuss focus background and then get me into that because  , I wo I w scientifically worked on that for for almost two years . grad b: Yeah , you should definitely ,  be on on that maybe maybe by after Monday we 'll y you can see what things we are and aren't grad a: Yeah . grad b: I would say that tha that those discussions have been primarily , Keith and Keith and me , but  like in th the meeting  , he sort of I thin like the last meeting we had , I think we were all very much part of it grad a: Yeah . grad b: but  grad a: Sometimes Hans has been sort of coming in there as sort of like a devil 's advocate type role or something , grad b: but different perspec Yeah . grad a: like \" This make you know , I 'm going to pretend I 'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this . \" And he 'll just go off on parts of it which definitely need fixing grad b: Right . grad a: but aren't where we 're at right now , so it 's grad b: Like like what you call certain things , grad a: Yeah . grad b: But in a sense , it 's good to know that he of all people professor c: OK . grad b: you know , like maybe a lot of people would have m much stronger reactions , so , you know , he 's like a relatively friendly linguist grad a: Yeah . professor c: OK , which was that o one of the things I would like to see happen is a paper that was tentatively called \" Towards a formal cognitive semantics \" which was addressed to these linguists  who haven't been following this stuff at all . professor c: So it could be that he 's actually , at some level , thinking about how am I going to communicate this story grad a: Yeah . professor c: But if he g if he turns is is really gonna turn around and help t to write this version that does connect with as many as possible of the other linguists in the world  then then it becomes important to use terminology that doesn't make it hard grad a:   professor c: it 's gonna be plenty hard for for people to understand it as it is , grad a: Yeah . I just wanted t to I have to catch up with him , and I wanted t to get a feeling for that . grad a: So I don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly , you know . grad a: Cuz sometimes he sort of sounds like we 're talking a bunch of goobledy - gook from his point of view . grad b: I think it 's good when we 're when we 're into data and looking at the some specific linguistic phenomenon in in English or in German , in particular , whatever , that 's great , professor c: Yeah . grad b: and Ben and and Hans are , if if anything , more you know , they have more to say than , let 's say , I would about some of these things . grad b: But when it 's like , well , w how do we capture these things , you know , I think it 's definitely been Keith and I who have d you know , who have worried more about the grad a:   That 's I I I think that should be the the core group grad b: s Which is fine . professor c: and  that 's , you know , I think very close to the maximum number of people working together that can get something done . And then we 're gon we 're gonna because of this other big thing we haven't talked about is actually implementing this stuff ? So that I guess the three of us are gonna connect tomorrow about that . I was just gonna say , though , that , for instance , there was you know , out of a meeting with Johno came the suggestion that \" oh , could it be that the meaning constraints really aren't used for selection ? \" which has sort of been implicit in the parsing strategy we talked about . grad b: In which case we w we can just say that they 're the effects or the bindings . Which  , so far , in terms of like putting up all the constraints as , you know , pushing them into type constraints , the when I 've , you know , propo then proposed it to linguists who haven't yet given me you know , we haven't yet thought of a reason that that wouldn't work . professor c: Yeah , it has to in the sense that you 're gonna use them eventu it 's you know , it 's sort of a , generate and test kind of thing , grad b: if there are some constraints that you hold back and don't use  , in your initial matching then you 'll match some things grad b:   professor c: I I d I don't think there 's any way that it could completely fail . It it could be that  , you wind up  The original bad idea of purely context - free grammars died because there were just vastly too many parses . And so th the concern might be that not that it would totally fail , but that grad b:   Right ? So by just having semantic even bringing semantics in for matching just in the form of j semantic types , right ? professor c: it would still genera grad b: Like \" conceptually these have to be construed as this , this , and this \" might still give us quite a few possibilities professor c: Yeah .  , cuz I think i I think it 's As you know , I think it 's real hard and if w if we Right . grad e: So , you your dance card is completely filled now ? grad a: Shoot . grad e: Why don't grad b: No , that 's not really true , grad a: Bummer . grad b: but like grad d: What about What about DDR ? grad b: It 's almost true . grad f:  grad b: Oh , I don't have it this weekend , so , tsk don't have to worry about that . professor c: DDR , he asked ? grad b: Speaking of dance , Dance Dance Revolution I can't believe I 'm It 's a it 's like a game , but it 's for , like , dancing . Hard to It 's like karaoke , but for dancing , and they tell you what It 's amazing . Well , y you know of it ? I i i it 's one of your hobbies ? It 's great exercise , I must say . They have , like , places instead of like Yeah , instead of karaoke bars now that have , like , DDR , like Yeah , yeah , I didn't until I started hanging out with this friend , who 's like \" Oh , well , I can bring over the DDR if you want <doc-sep>OK , so , you 've got some , Xerox things to pass out ? phd a: Yeah , professor d: That are phd a:  .  , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font ! phd a: Next time we will put colors or something . phd a: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done professor d:  Go ahead . So since last week we 've started to fill the column with   features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely professor d:    phd a: well , it 's still not completely filled , professor d:  phd a: but we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and finally , hhh ,  ehhh PL -  delta seems very important . If you take  , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next t the second , part of the table , professor d:   phd a:  when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta . professor d: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , the baseline performance , phd a: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So professor d: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ? phd a: Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much   much smaller professor d: Yes . phd a: But , actually , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition , professor d:   phd a:  when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number , professor d:   phd a: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's we have one hundred and seventy - two , professor d: Yes . Yeah , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , that we did not have last week .  , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian . phd a: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on ,  TI - digits . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE ,  from  English digits , and from Italian digits . phd a: and  , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , so we have to to redo the  the experiment training the net with ,  PLP , but with delta . Well , it 's it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . The first one , yeah , is combining , two feature streams ,  using and each feature stream has its own MPL . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . You know you can you can comment these results , phd b: Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , mmm , if we doesn't use the delta - delta ,  we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when phd a: Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are  recognition accuracy . phd b: w Yeah , this Yeah , this number recognition acc phd a: So it 's not the Again we switch to another phd b: Yes , and the baseline the baseline have i is eighty - two . phd b: Yeah phd a: So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this . phd b: And first in the experiment - one I I do I I use different MLP , professor d:   And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy . phd a: Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP , professor d:   phd a: but this is not the case for Italian what where the error rate is c is almost  twice the error rate of PLP . phd a: So , well , I don't think this is a bug but this this is something in probably in the MSG  process that  I don't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the the there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But that we need to sort out if want to  get improvement by combining PLP and MSG professor d:   phd a: And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP . professor d: I  , the  , baseline system when you said the baseline system was  ,  eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was ,  Italian mismatched d  , digits , is the testing , phd b: Yeah . professor d: So the \" mismatch \" just refers to the noise and and ,  microphone and so forth , phd a: Yeah . professor d: right ? So ,  did we have So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is is the  Italian digits ? phd b: The train the training of the HTK ? professor d: The phd b: Yes . So ,  So what that says is that in a matched condition , we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the  PLP . Now w would do we have a number , I suppose for the matched I I don't mean matched , but  use of Italian training in Italian digits for PLP only ? phd b:  yes ? phd a:  yeah , so this is basically this is in the table . phd a: Fift - So No , it 's it 's the phd b: No . professor d: No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ? phd a: Of of of  eighteen phd b: Eighty . So  professor d: Oh this is accuracy !  phd a: so we have nine nine let 's say ninety percent . professor d: OK , so even just PLP , it is not , in the matched condition  I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping . It 's not Do you have this result with PLP alone , j fee feeding HTK ? professor d: So , s phd a: That That 's what you mean ? phd b: Yeah , phd a: Just PLP at the input of HTK . professor d: so adding MSG phd a:  professor d:  Well , but that 's yeah , that 's without the neural net , phd a: Yeah , that 's without the neural net professor d: right ? phd a: and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization . phd b:  phd a: Eighty - two is the it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use well , OGI , they use MFCC th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization professor d: Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy . phd a: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So professor d: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to to ninety , or something . phd a: Well , ninety No , I  ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight . So ,  So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you  does not help in that case . professor d: The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but And the multi - English , does  So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with ,  eighteen percent error rate , roughly . professor d:  and we  almost ,  cut that in half by  putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net . About ,  sixteen percent or something of the error , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition . OK ? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching , data for the  for the new for the other languages and so forth .  , one qu thing is that ,  I think I asked you this before , but I wanna double check . When you say \" ME \" in these other tests , that 's the multi - English , phd a: That 's it 's a part it 's professor d: but it is not all of the multi - English , right ? It is some piece of part of it . professor d: And the multi - English is how much ? phd b: You have here the information . professor d: Oh , so you used almost all You used two thirds of it , phd a: Yeah . So , it it 's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish . grad c: Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled , phd a: Yeah , it 's phd b: Yeah . Mmm , with the experiment type - two , I first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature another feature . phd b: And we s we can first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , and we can see that in the situation , the MSG - three , the same help nothing . phd b: And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta PLP delta and delta - delta . And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . And we have a l little bit less result than the the the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta . phd b: Maybe if when we have the new the new neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe the final result must be better . phd a: Actually , just to be some more phd b:  phd a: Do This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the professor d: Yes , yeah ,  it can't be compared with the other phd a: Which number ? professor d: cuz this is ,  with multi - English , training . professor d: So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , which is that ,  the eighty - four point six . professor d: So phd a: Yeah , but  in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net professor d: Yeah . phd b: No , but they they feature @ @ without phd a: So we use feature out  , net outputs together with features . So yeah , this is not perhaps not clear here but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features . So you 're saying w so asking the question , \" What what has adding the MLP done to improve over the , phd a: So , just Yeah so , actually it it it decreased the the accuracy . phd a: And even the MLP alone What gives the MLP alone ? Multi - English PLP . So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six , phd b: But phd a: that gives eighty - seven point one . Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh , OK , eighty - three point six and eighty eighty - eight point six . But I don't know but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help . professor d: Well , that 's that 's one thing , but see the other thing is that ,  it 's good to take the difficult case , but let 's let 's consider what that means . What what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that  my interpretation of your your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training . professor d: When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems . professor d: And , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and doesn't hurt us too much when it when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad . professor d: So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on ,  on say digits , phd a: On TI - digits ? OK .  , then does that , eh you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , does it does it then look much better ? phd a:   professor d: And so what is the range over these different kinds of  of tests ? So , an anyway . phd b: And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , d I have found more or less the same result . phd a: So , it 's slightly better , phd b: Little bit better ? phd a: yeah . professor d: And and you know again maybe if you use the , delta there , you would bring it up to where it was ,  you know at least about the same for a difficult case . phd a: It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output . And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , doesn't work professor d: Yeah . Because I for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one . professor d: by the way , there is a another , suggestion that would apply , to the second configuration , which , was made , by , Hari . And that was that , if you have  feed two streams into HTK , and you , change the ,  variances if you scale the variances associated with ,  these streams  , you can effectively scale the streams . Right ? So , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK , which is the rule here , you can still change the variances phd a:   professor d: And , so , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance . professor d: And , so this is just setting them to be , excuse me , of equal equal weight . professor d: Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , but but , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition . Yeah , you have to change the No , you can just do it in as once you 've done the training grad c: And then you can vary it . professor d: Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could you could just scale them all . But Is it i th  the HTK models are diagonal covariances , so I d Is it professor d: That 's  , exactly the point , I think , that if you change  , change what they are phd a:  . professor d: It 's diagonal covariance matrices , but you say what those variances are . professor d: So , that you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna it 's gonna it 's gonna internally multiply it and and  , i it im  implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's it 's gonna it 's it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the change the variances of some of the features . phd b: do ? professor d: So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , the s the strength that you apply the features . So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just just not the right thing to do . Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms because , you know , maybe it should be a different number for for each kind of test set , or something , phd a:   professor d: So I guess the other thing is to take you know if one were to take , you know , a couple of the most successful of these , phd a: Yeah , and test across everything . phd a: So , the next point , yeah , we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn , about their  , articulatory stuff ,  . phd a: discussion with Hynek , Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our our networks with their within their block diagram , where to plug in the the network , after the the feature , before as  a as a plugin or as a anoth another path , discussion about multi - band and TRAPS , actually Hynek would like to see , perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each  critical band . And he would like to replace these by a network which would , make the system look like a TRAP . Basically , this is a TRAP system kind of TRAP system , but where the neural network are replaced by LDA .  , yeah , and about multi - band , I started multi - band MLP trainings ,  mmh Actually , I w I w hhh prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . So I take exactly the same configurations , seven bands with nine frames of context , and we just train on TIMIT , and on the large database , so , with SPINE and everything . So , this would would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands , and but with a lot of context also . So  Yeah , we still have to work on Finnish , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages .  , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what everything that has been done . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on one , two , three , four , three , four , five , six , seven ten on ten different databases . phd a: the number of frames is bad also , so we have one million and a half for some , three million for other , and six million for the last one .  , yeah ! As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled , and perhaps this is what makes the difference . First ,  with respect to the on - line normalization , there are that use bad on - line normalization , and other good on - line normalization . With respect to the features , with respect to the use of delta or no ,  with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets . s What 's this ? We only have two hundred eighty six different tests And no not two thousand . phd b: I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the professor d: Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed , OK . but when the M - MLP is trained on the  is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features . Except if the features are bad  , actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized . In this case the tandem is still better even if it 's trained on not on the target digits . phd a: so the fourth point is , yeah , the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better the best network . professor d: So , on the MSG  problem  , I think that in in the  , in the short time solution  , that is , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress , phd a:   professor d: much as I said with JRASTA , even though I really like JRASTA and I really like MSG , phd a:   professor d: I think it 's kind of in category that it 's , it it may be complicated . professor d: And  it might be if someone 's interested in it , certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term , once we get out of this particular rush  for results . professor d: But in the short term , unless you have some some s strong idea of what 's wrong , phd a: I don't know at all but I 've perhaps I have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite quite simple or just like nnn , no high - pass filter professor d: Yeah , probably . professor d: There 's supposed to well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though , right ? phd a: It 's There is , yeah , an AGC - kind of AGC . professor d: Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be  , yeah , phd a: Mmm . professor d: In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design , phd a:  . Are your results are still with the bad the bad phd b: Maybe , may No ? With the better phd a: With the O - OLN - two ? phd b: No ? phd a: Ah yeah , you have you have OLN - two , phd b: Oh ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! With \" two \" , with \" on - line - two \" . professor d: \" Two \" is good ? phd a: And professor d: No , \" two \" is bad . It 's probably something simple  , i if if  someone , you know , wants to play with it for a little bit . professor d: but but my my guess would be that it 's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find . That 's that what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task If it 's on the target task then it it it helps to have the MLP transforming it . professor d: If it  if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is ,  you can get  , a reduction in performance . professor d: And the question is now how to how to get one and not the other ? Or how to how to ameliorate the the problems . professor d: because it it certainly does is nice to have in there , when it when there is something like the training data . So , the the reason Yeah , the reason is that the perhaps the target the the task dependency the language dependency , and the noise dependency professor d: So that 's what you say th there . phd a: Well , the e e But this is still not clear because , I I I don't think we have enough result to talk about the the language dependency . Well , the TIMIT network is still the best but there is also an the other difference , the fact that it 's it 's hand - labeled .  , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones but it 's  Just  , have a seat . s Summary of the first  ,  forty - five minutes is that some stuff work and works , and some stuff doesn't OK , phd a: We still have  this One of these perhaps ? phd b: Yeah .  professor d: Yeah , I guess we can do a little better than that but I think if you if you start off with the other one , actually , that sort of has it in words and then th that has it the associated results . So you 're saying that  , although from what we see , yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we don't do as well as in the target thing . But you 're saying that  , it is Although that general thing is observable so far , there 's something you 're not completely convinced about . What what do you mean ? phd a: mmm , that the the fact that s Well , for for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best ,  which is the English net . But you have two two effects , the effect of changing language and the effect of training on something that 's Viterbi - aligned instead of hand hand - labeled . professor d: Do you think the alignments are bad ?  , have you looked at the alignments at all ? What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ? phd a: Mmm . Because , that is just looking but  ,  It 's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment . But , perhaps it 's not really the the alignment that 's bad but the just the ph phoneme string that 's used for the alignment professor d: Aha ! phd a: Mmm .  professor d: The pronunciation models and so forth phd a:  for We It 's single pronunciation ,  professor d: Aha . phd a: so we asked people to listen to the  the sentence and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them .  , the third The third  issue is the noise dependency perhaps but , well , this is not clear yet because all our nets are trained on the same noises and professor d: I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth . professor d: OK , yeah , just don't just need more more results there with that @ @ .  , with respect to the network size , there 's one experiment that 's still running and we should have the result today , comparing network with five hundred and one thousand units . We can , we can tell which training set gives the best result , but we don't know exactly why . professor d: \" Multi - multi - English \" just means \" TIMIT \" , phd a: Yeah . professor d: It 's sort of , yes it 's mul it 's multi -  - purpose . So Yeah , the training targets actually , the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency and the noise dependency . And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets . For moment you use we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets , and perhaps even ,  use networks that doesn't do classification but just regression so  , train to have neural networks that  , professor d:   phd a: does a regression and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . phd a:  professor d: Yeah , that seems like a good thing to do , probably ,  not  again a short - term sort of thing . professor d:  one of the things about that is that  it 's e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being is being dependent on very dependent on the kind of noise and and so forth . phd a: So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this this could be could help could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part  we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network , phd b: Yeah . phd a: and So this is one approach and the other is multi - band  , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes . phd a: So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with  , features - based targets could could could help . professor d: Yeah , if you i i It 's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up  w yeah , one one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have  some reasonable database ,  but then which is  copied over many times with a range of different noises , phd a:   professor d: And  If Cuz what you 're trying to do is come up with a a core , reasonable feature set which is then gonna be used  , by the the   system . The future work is , well , try to connect to the to make to plug in the system to the OGI system . professor d: And I guess , you know , the the the real open question , e u there 's lots of open questions , but one of the core quote \" open questions \" for that is  , if we take the  you know , the best ones here , maybe not just the best one , but the best few or something You want the most promising group from these other experiments .  , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ? phd a: Mmm , professor d:  . professor d: y Right ? And then  then see , again , how We know that there 's a mis there 's a  a a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than than ,  we 're gonna test on , but well , if you look over a range of these different tests  , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features ,  stand up over that range ? phd b:   And  , take let 's say , just take  multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training . How does that How does that compare between the phd a: So all the all the test sets you mean , yeah . professor d: All the different test sets , phd a: And professor d: and for and for the couple different ways that you have of of of combining them . And perhaps doing this for cha changing the variance of the streams and so on getting different scaling phd b:   Yeah , so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the to their diagram . Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn , they they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates , professor d: Yeah . It 's a little strange phd a: or ? Mmm ? professor d: but on the other hand they did it before . And because also perhaps we know that the when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help .  , we we wanna get their path running here , right ? If so , we can add this other stuff . professor d: as an additional path right ? phd a: Yeah , the the way we want to do professor d: Cuz they 're doing LDA RASTA . phd a: The d What ? professor d: They 're doing LDA RASTA , phd a: Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to just to get the VAD labels and the final features . professor d: yeah ? phd a: So they will send us the Well , provide us with the feature files , professor d: I see . phd a: and with VAD  , binary labels so that we can  , get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream . First thing of course we 'd wanna do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them . You mean Oh , yeah ! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ? professor d: Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we have we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK . But ,  just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results so we can duplicate it before we add in another phd a: Mmm . Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA , I don't know if we want to We can try networks with LogRASTA filtered features . But professor d: Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb I 'm I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . that u  , when you 're talking about combining multiple features ,  Suppose we said , \" OK , we 've got these different features and so forth , but PLP seems pretty good . We have different languages , we have different different noises ,  If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps with them . What what What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . That is , that yes , if you knew what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , and then you fed the thing ,  something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . So you you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but professor d: It works better if what ? phd a: Yea professor d: I see . Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f for this kind of task , I would think , sort of a modest amount . We have a modest amount of of  training data from a couple different conditions , and then  in yeah , that and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type  , and  , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have  , the data to train up  one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in we still don't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in  , a fe few different databases and  the performance is getting worse and  , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is is is is is better . And  that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another we don't have  , seemingly , the ability to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , all of the variability that we 're gonna be covering . So that I 'm I 'm I 'm hoping that  , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , that  if we if they look at more constrained conditions they they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them .  i i e The  I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA RASTA , which is a kind of LogRASTA , it 's just that they have the  it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , and it 's it  it 's just that they d it 's trained up , right ? That that  benefitted from on - line normalization . So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ?  they they were not not using the neural net . We 've been sort of ignoring that , haven't we ? phd a: Yeah , so I don't know . professor d: But phd a: But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we professor d: Yeah , but I li Well , I think My impression You you folks have been looking at this more than me . But my impression was that  , there was a a a a strict constraint on the delay , phd b: Yeah . professor d: but beyond that it was kind of that  using less memory was better , and using less CPU was better . We have to get some reference point to where we Well , what 's a reasonable number ? Perhaps be because if it 's if it 's too large or large or @ @ professor d: well I don't think we 're  completely off the wall .  I think that if we if we have  ,  the ultimate fall back that we could do If we find   we may find that we we 're not really gonna worry about the M L You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in . professor d: If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , we might even have more than one MLP . professor d: And it 's  We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that .  , what what are they What are they gonna be working Do we know what they 're gonna be working on while we take their features , phd a: They 're They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band . Sunil , what was he doing , do you remember ? phd b: Sunil ? phd a: Yeah . He was doing something new or ? phd b: I I don't re I didn't remember . phd a: I think they were also mainly , well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , but mainly trying to tune their their system as it is now to just trying to get the best from this this architecture . So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get There 'd be some point where you say , \" OK , this is their version - one \" or whatever , and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them , phd a:   We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then  , when it gets to be  , January some point  , we say , \" OK we we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . So now   what 's your newest version ? \" And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better and then we we 'd combine it .  I I I used to work with  folks who were trying to improve a good  ,  system with  with a neural net system and  , it was a common problem that you 'd Oh , and this Actually , this is true not just for neural nets but just for in general if people were working with  , rescoring  , N - best lists or lattices that come came from  , a mainstream recognizer .  , You get something from the the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring . So by the time you have  , improved their score , they have also improved their score phd a: Mmm . professor d: So , I guess at some point we 'll have to phd a: So it 's professor d: I I don't know . I think we 're we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases . I think at the moment they they say that they have a better thing we can we e e phd a: Mmm . professor d: What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things , presumably  , in a in a day we could turn around  , taking a new set of things from them and and rescoring it , phd a: Mmm . I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the  , you know , different trainings . So we we can for we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps , professor d: That 's sort of wide open . phd a: or focus more on the targets and on the training data and ? professor d: Yeah , I think for right now  , I th I I really liked MSG . And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . And  , I think that there is ultimately a really good  , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties .  , but  , we only have limited time and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at . professor d: And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets , and fitting in  what we 're doing with what they 're doing , and , you know , with limited time . And then , you know , once we  , having gone through this process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things  , come up that you are curious about  , that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation  , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested  and  and and work with it , you know , for the next round .  , as you can tell from these numbers  , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem . professor d: Well I figured that , but That what what what were you involved in in this primarily ? grad c: helping out  , preparing Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been  ,  w doing some work on the on the preparing all all the data for them to to  , train and to test on . Right now , I 'm I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class . What 's what 's that ? grad c: I 'm trying to  So there was a paper in ICSLP about  this this multi - band  , belief - net structure . grad c:  basically it was two H M Ms with with a with a dependency arrow between the two H M professor d:  - huh . grad c: And so I wanna try try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . And  , I 'm just gonna see if if that that better models  ,  asynchrony in any way or  Yeah . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need You happy with where we are ? phd a: Mmm . professor d: Know know wher know where we 're going ?  phd a: I think so , yeah . grad e: Al - actually I should mention So if  , about the Linux machine \" Swede . grad e: And  Dan Ellis I believe knows something about using that machine so phd a: Mmm . grad e: If people are interested in in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that . phd a: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . professor d: Right ?  there 's there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU  , for training and so on ? Yeah . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know We just select what works fine professor d: OK . to work professor d: And we 're OK on And we 're OK on disk ? phd a: and It 's OK , yeah . Alright , so  , since  , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . We didn't  I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , pretty easily . OK , so we 'll  I 'll start off the   connect the phd a: My battery is low "

        "Query": "Summarize the feedback and suggestions for the prototype of the remote, including the special features discussed.",
        "Summary": "The remote design was praised by the marketing team for its user-friendly layout, allowing users to easily reach all buttons with one thumb, regardless of hand size. The prominent placement of the on-off button and attractive colors were also noted as positive features. To cater to both left- and right-handed individuals, mute buttons were positioned on either side. For international appeal, channel buttons would be labeled with numbers while the rest would feature easily recognizable symbols. Marketing also suggested incorporating a humorous element into the shell design, playing on the concept of a rapid snail. The user interface and industrial designers agreed on this idea. The remote's unique selling points would include voice recognition, a feature not commonly found in remotes within the same price range, and its adorable appearance, with the snail image serving as a visual attraction. However, practicality would not be a standout feature, as it was assumed that all competitors would offer this.",
        "Article": "marketing: Hello project manager:  like before we  I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting marketing:  it was discussed in the last meeting  which was opened by the presentation from the interface  designer that  looks would be very important on this new remote user interface: Designer . It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera .  speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal  features she would like see d d to be integrated in this  in this new remote . user interface: project manager:  marketing: And she was challenged on that point project manager: that's right . industrial designer: project manager: But  her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful .  technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the  to the generat to the generator amplification and  the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature  to to to consider . project manager: She would like  this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip  scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . The marketing expert  who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . To do that  maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . And the decision that we took last time was that  the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery  should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . industrial designer:  and it's it's blue in colour  bright and  it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons marketing: industrial designer:   and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . marketing: You used to have all the buttons user interface: industrial designer:  yeah and   the material which we are going to use for the case is  plastic and  w which which is s strong   and also  for the  the material is plastic and  for the buttons it is  s soft rubber  and als marketing: Oh that's good , industrial designer: yeah . industrial designer: Yeah because   you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . industrial designer: And then   for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green marketing: Now these features includes the s  signal emitting  signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . user interface: we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness marketing: Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . marketing: The next channel in the numeric pattern , or user interface: No , swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . user interface: And at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . user interface: give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective . industrial designer: marketing: Okay , well  what what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , user interface: Yes , yes . marketing: that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands industrial designer: marketing: and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ? project manager: Yes the buttons are all raised , right ? marketing: The buttons are all raised project manager: Are raised , marketing: and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , project manager: Right . user interface: industrial designer: marketing:  and  I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . project manager: Yes , and it sort of sticks up so that you really marketing: Yeah , that's great . project manager: you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah ,  the  these buttons  around here are the mute user interface: No , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . project manager: So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . marketing: And this brings the menu up on the screen ? user interface: Pardon me ? This is the menu yes , yes . marketing: This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are user interface: A the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , marketing: Okay . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Okay and now I'm supposed to project manager: Well , I have one question marketing: yeah . project manager:  will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? user interface: Yes , it will have  these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . project manager: Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it user interface: Yes , which can be easily recognised . marketing: Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Text that we can have on the case itself , project manager: That's right . user interface: And and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . marketing: Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow industrial designer: marketing: and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that user interface: project manager: Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? marketing: So project manager: That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual marketing: I think voice recognition is our big selling point industrial designer:  . project manager: And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . marketing: So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image  play with the visual and then the voice recognition . project manager: Okay , now  having said that marketing: I'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't I ? project manager: No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we  just have done . marketing: Ah , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something . marketing: Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? Or project manager: Oh , okay yeah , okay , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  electronics , simple chip on print ? Is that's what we're using ? user interface: Yes . project manager:  but , yes but industrial designer: I think  that is  f for rubbers that is  yeah case material . project manager: That's just for the case material , user interface: Is this for the case ? Yes . project manager: so special colours though , we having that , marketing: Oh okay , the - , ' kay . marketing: 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , right ? project manager: No . project manager: button supplement special colour ? user interface: Speci Yes project manager: Special form ? user interface: Yes d we do have special form . user interface: One two three four five six seven eight nine project manager:  ? industrial designer: Maybe it is it just n project manager: Eight , eight point two . marketing: Okay , well  obviously my method for  s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . marketing: We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . marketing: And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . marketing: And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons industrial designer: marketing: and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . industrial designer: marketing: So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel  and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . marketing: They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . The size is small  and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . I think that it's I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven . And then functionality  I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . marketing: So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . project manager: And  I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . marketing: Well ,  we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? project manager: Eight , eight twenty , yes . industrial designer: Eight twenty so marketing: And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend . industrial designer: We have  four euros , yeah project manager:  maximum we have another four point three euros  four thirty . Well  that's project manager: But  we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . marketing: Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . project manager: I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just  recog I just remembered that there was no that that was not  included  that there was no room for any special features , okay ? industrial designer: Included , yeah . You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ? marketing: well I isn't this my last slide ? project manager: I dunno .  and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . project manager: Why ? Wh why you need that up ? marketing:  ? Well because I can't remember what I put on there . Okay user interface: marketing: you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . user interface: industrial designer: marketing:  and then how about how we doing on colour ? project manager: Colour  I marketing: Colour , I gave it a one . marketing: Okay , I gave it a three , two , user interface: I'll give three . marketing: And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but project manager: Well it's also you can't really try it out  the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view marketing: Yeah .  the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . marketing: But  otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product . Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? project manager:  . Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? user interface: We can always improve , yes .  I think they are quite big , so I think I  we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . Well then again if we're gonna  do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . marketing: So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . marketing:  and a couple of other th maybe comp  consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . project manager: Y  al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget industrial designer: user interface: And maybe project manager: and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just  add a whole lot of more things . project manager:   we need  you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . project manager: So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ?  ,  are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ?  I think personally I think  I'm pretty happy . marketing: I'm pretty happy with it too , yeah  , project manager:  an industrial designer: Even I'm happy . project manager: and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?  marketing: I think you've done a good job , Miss leader . project manager: And I think team work I think was very very good , I think we really industrial designer: project manager: And  I think we are we happy with the means we used ? We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things . marketing: Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , user interface: Whiteboard more , yes , yes .  , it's maybe not in the best position in the room  you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit . project manager: I think we we did ,  in more than one respect and  so I think we did very well here . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: project manager: So I I thank you all very much . project manager: I always get it on here , but getting it off is industrial designer: Do we do we have some time left ?  you have user interface: They say it's forty minutes . project manager: Ah yes we have time later marketing: But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished . marketing: It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace "

        "Summary": "The team discussed the size of the remote control, with Marketing suggesting that the TV itself could have a user-friendly remote control system using different technology. However, the Project Manager believed that this idea would not appeal to men and Marketing eventually gave up on it. The group also debated whether installing a new remote would be seen as a technological innovation, with Marketing recommending voice recognition technology due to its fashionable and trendy appeal. The Marketing team emphasized the importance of innovation, considering the use of fruit and vegetable logos and primary colors on the remote control. They also noted that younger people were more interested in features like LCD screens and speech recognition, while older people were willing to spend more money on larger remote controls. Marketing highlighted the volume and channel buttons as the most important and should be easily accessible.",
        "Article": "The opening , which we are doing now ,  and the special note , I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , which means I will make  minutes as I did of the previous meeting . industrial designer: project manager: And  I also put these as fast as possible in the  project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed .  if I'm right , there are three presentations , I guess each one of you has prepared one ? Good . project manager: And  we will also take a look at new project requirements ,  if you haven't heard about them yet . And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . marketing: Well , shall I go first with the users ? user interface: Well marketing: I think well okay no problem . project manager: Is there an order ? I haven't user interface: everybody already has his presentation , marketing: Ja precies , ja precies , ja precies user interface: so you can adjust it . Huh ? Okay ,  project manager: And one question ,  your name Denni , is it with a marketing: E_I_E_ .  when you press a button ,  that's when you do pr for example when you  want to turn up the volume ,  a little connection is made  the the rubber  button just presses on a project manager: Sorry . marketing: user interface: industrial designer: on a little print plate  which  makes   a connection that  gives the chips ,  which is  mounted beneath those  that plastic of a rubber button .  senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau  for example the the volume up or volume down button .   the the chip  makes a Morse code  like  signal which  then is si  signalled to  several transistors which makes  which sends the signal to a little let .  the findings   that I found  searching up some  detailed information about the remote controls , are that  they are very easy to produce ,  it is pis  it's possible to  make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as  printing a page ,  just  fibreglass plate  is b  is  covered with  some  coatings and   and chips . user interface: industrial designer:  and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls  have to work or  how that how  to make some chips that are possible to  to to transmit those  signals . project manager: Yeah , it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board .  well user interface: industrial designer: the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button .  when it is pressed down , the switch is ter is  is switched on , so with  the wire is sent to the to the chip in  co-operation with the battery of course , because to make  a a signal possible you have to have some sort of  li  a d ad  electronic  user interface: marketing: Infrared light .  w after it's being composed by the chip  the signal  is transported  to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in  in the television set . Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to   wind it up or something , or just is it's it's very light to  to make  to use it .  I personally  pref prefer that  it would be p  come available in the various colours , and  easy to use buttons . industrial designer: And it is possible for several designs and  easy to use b  sorry , easy to use buttons . Perhaps soft touch ,  touch screen  buttons because  the rubber buttons are always   they  slightly  they can be slightly damaged , marketing: industrial designer:  so the numbers on the buttons are not possible  to read anymore . industrial designer: Okay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , and  marketing: To this meeting . user interface: Well  , my name's , and I looked at  technical functions design of the remote .  I did this by  looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they  they look , and information from the web that I found .  well what I found was that  th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you  d what you described  just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off ,  change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing .  play video , teletext , but also t  play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of  buttons etcetera . And  not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but  the the essential stuff is there .  I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred  approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't  buy it .  , well perf personal preferences is is  a simple remote , with  the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But  keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and  is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them . And then  make it I would make so that you can could  use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that   does with the vi the the video , it could also work with  with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for  anything . We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just Yeah , and the users , actually . industrial designer: marketing: The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five  years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . industrial designer: marketing: So we don't have to make it very small , like  like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . marketing: and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . So  if that's k  if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . industrial designer:  L_C_D_ screen as in  touch screen ? marketing: Yeah , touch screen , yeah . marketing: So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , user interface: marketing: but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use industrial designer: marketing: because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . project manager: then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them marketing: Ja , project manager: so you can all read them . project manager: So that's  the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to  teletext .  the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think .  our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And  a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our  corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . So , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ? user interface: Well you said it should only  work with one appliance ? marketing: Be television . user interface: And the video also , or not  ? project manager: Well it says only for television here , huh . user interface: Then it should have  on , off , industrial designer: Yeah for user interface: and  industrial designer: Standby options , marketing: Yeah , the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , industrial designer: yeah ?  yeah . And per perhaps  marketing: oh teletext doesn't have to be ? user interface: No . user interface: Well   yes yes s sh A button where you can  change from one number to two numbers . user interface: Don't know if that's got a name , industrial designer: Yeah I understand what you mean . user interface: but marketing: I think it's I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , industrial designer: It makes it twelve , yeah . marketing: and that's that's not relaxed industrial designer: Well , not really marketing: to user . industrial designer: d  wh the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to  press one and then two to make  the  tj to reach channel twelve . industrial designer: But  all the television makes  use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to  to get marketing: Yeah . marketing: Our main targets' age are ? were ? Forty five plus , or ? user interface: Mute misschien also . project manager: new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers  of forty plus . marketing: Forties , okay because because younger people as  younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so I think to  Because on most recog remote controls  the print plate will be broken how much , two years . marketing: With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to  for fingerprint , industrial designer: Yeah , we we could yeah . user interface: marketing: industrial designer: But  Well  is it possible to make an L_C_D_ screen  , how was the information ? marketing: Yeah , it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen . user interface: But , do you industrial designer: Yeah but  will we not  exceed our  our  production  marketing: Yeah you don't know how much it costs . Yeah , you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: Is it possible to find out , anyway ? marketing: No , I don't have any costs here , industrial designer: You know ? marketing: I only have percentages . user interface: But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have  I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: No , an L_C_D_ screen's just like  like a drawn here .  just  displays several buttons , user interface: Yeah ? industrial designer: for example  if you wanted the minimal  use b  buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h  displays four buttons on the screen user interface: Oh right , so you can industrial designer: and it's possible to p  press them down , just like a touch screen . marketing: Yeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen industrial designer: Yeah yeah . project manager: So we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: I think it's the most easier thing , industrial designer: That's my  project manager: And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive . user interface: Any guesses ? industrial designer: marketing: industrial designer: Well I suppose wi if the mar if our  if the i if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens , we should make 'em . industrial designer: And if that is our d  market share to  and our goal to  deliver those  remote controls user interface: But But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? marketing: Yeah , but  , s forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . user interface: Oh , so still a little bit people marketing: But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . But you don't want to alienate the other  marketing: No , that not now , but , so user interface: But if they also buy it then it's alright . marketing: Yeah , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . project manager: Okay , so L_C_D_ it is ? user interface: An Yes . project manager: And what else ? industrial designer: I hope we  h and let's hope to reach those  those sales . marketing: Yeah , i i if it Yeah , if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . industrial designer: Yeah , can you   s I think that that they will send you some information about  the cost of L_C_D_  screens . user interface: But perhaps later , industrial designer:  so if you  user interface: so  industrial designer: Yeah , so if you  you receive an email about that ,  can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in  our projects mail  folder . industrial designer: I  user interface: Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's  too expensive . industrial designer: user interface: The L_C_D_ ? Oh that's a bit of a problem . marketing: Yeah , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy . marketing: Yeah , just a the plain remotes , not not specific L_C_D_ remotes . project manager: Yeah , and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote , marketing: So project manager: because it's new , as far as I know . marketing: And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . Okay ? project manager: Okay , what else does our remote need ? user interface: A mute button . And marketing: The most important things on a f on an on an  remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: But But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ? marketing: Other things are Sorry ? user interface: Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill . Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_  screen for teletext . industrial designer: And there's also a marketing: And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , user interface: Yeah , they are less important , but I think they should be there , marketing: Less important . user interface: or not ? marketing: Yeah , should be there , industrial designer: A sh marketing: but not press industrial designer: but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . industrial designer:  I think it's also important to  make it possible to  how do you call it in English , to not use batteries , and use ac  bat  batteries to  to be project manager: So  you can mount  the the the  marketing: Yeah , in a breath it's industrial designer:  the remote control to  project manager: user interface: We should think of the twelve fifty we have industrial designer: to refill the user interface: but marketing: Yeah , user interface: I don't know how much that's going to  marketing: but we don't we don't have any costs now , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: because i  when you get an L_C_D_ screen , you run it on batteries , user interface: Yeah . user interface: If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . user interface: You shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can  project manager: industrial designer:  marketing: Yeah , I think it's it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who who  that you have to turn it on first and then use it , user interface: Nee that's that's  yeah . marketing: so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . user interface: But then you can't industrial designer: And go to standby mode when you don't use it , user interface: Yeah . user interface: marketing: And then b that  industrial designer: marketing: before an hour when its get again gets empty . marketing: Yeah , because when you're watching T_V_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger , user interface: Yeah . Yeah , b when the batteries are low industrial designer: No , marketing: and I don't think it industrial designer: when you when you're done with s  w  watching your television , you have to put it marketing: Yeah , okay , but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then . user interface: But you'll also forget to put it in , industrial designer: Yeah sure , of course . user interface: because you throw it on the couch industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but marketing: then you have a problem . industrial designer: so I marketing: Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged . user interface: Well I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , marketing: So . user interface: or not ? marketing: Yeah because you have b user interface: 'Cause marketing: but you have L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: High power user cell , i  it should be  a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , marketing: Yes . industrial designer: that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . Because you are obliged to  put it in the charger and not to  leave it in a couch  between some cushions . user interface: But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch project manager: Yeah , also . user interface: because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . industrial designer: Yeah just just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . project manager: Okay , well I've marketing: It has to be easy to use also , or things . industrial designer: Functional designs  for the elderly  you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , marketing: I think . industrial designer: Because we can look at   perhaps  forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons . project manager: And you said something about speech recognition ? marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Speech recognition ? marketing: it says also industrial designer: Hello . That's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . marketing: But then I I I project manager: Even bigger than for L_C_D_ . industrial designer: let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: that should it has to be remote control , not marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , industrial designer: Sure why not why not marketing: Yeah . user interface: or ? marketing: Is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . user interface: Oh , but do we want to implement that , or ? marketing: I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient . project manager: But when you look at the percentages marketing: Yeah , it says a lot , but project manager: Speech recognition scores even higher , huh ? industrial designer: Perhaps the options should be  Why not ? user interface: project manager: Yeah , well , industrial designer: Why not ? project manager: maybe because of the cost , but  nobody knows  how much  it will cost  . industrial designer: Let's hope  to have some  d user interface: I know marketing: No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen and thirty five want speech recognition . user interface: With that  marketing: If it should be done , if it could be done , I won't matter . user interface: but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , industrial designer: Yeah . Then  it's y it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English marketing: True . marketing: But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . marketing: Because then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than  Swahili or something . marketing: 'Kay , what else ? project manager: So , no speech recognition ? Or user interface: Well , if it could be done , we marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Y it should be done . industrial designer: That's not so difficult at all , project manager: Okay , just make a separate remote for each  industrial designer: because I already use on several voice operated systems , and they are all possible to  not all , but user interface: Well , you sh you should to adjust the thing . I think it can't be implemented , but maybe user interface: You could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something . Well I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection ,  the digits from one to zero , huh .  a digits button to switch  between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator .  we're going to use a docking station and  probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . user interface: I With  teletext if it wasn't ver very important , it was but marketing: No , but user interface: You also now have colours . Yeah , marketing: Curved ? user interface: when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , and when you press the industrial designer:  yeah . user interface: because it says that teletext not really important , industrial designer: S Shortcuts . marketing: I think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus . marketing: D Mainly if you turn the  remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . project manager: Okay , so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , and industrial designer:  . industrial designer: So does it confuse  the user ? user interface: You'll have to search for it . user interface: industrial designer: If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options  become available . project manager: Okay , but no more buttons or functions , or ? user interface: I guess not . What else can you do with a television ? user interface: We've got anon project manager: Aren't we forgetting something very important ? user interface: Have got got two examples here , but I don't think there's anything we're missing . user interface: Well , we don't have the video orders marketing: Yes , so this is your presentation . user interface: Yeah , you could look here all the the marketing: Which ones were yours ? user interface:  th th th th I don't know , technical functions . marketing: Techni user interface: They're a bit small , you can we should stretch them , because project manager: Ping . user interface: And for a T_V_ ? Can you zoom in a T_V_ ? marketing: Yeah , b wide screen , high screen , different things you have , user interface: Or that you can put 'em on  on on wide and marketing: yeah different  user interface: yeah . user interface: Yeah , so you can program the marketing: So those four , and of course the main . user interface: Yeah , so the first you see the main , and the other ones you can  go to  marketing: Yeah . marketing: Something industrial designer: There are a lot of options depending  on what kind of television you got . marketing: Yeah , if  industrial designer: 'Cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the  the screen settings marketing: No , you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't industrial designer:  for  marketing: then you don't use it . industrial designer: Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is  the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: I Because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g marketing: Yeah , then defines itself . Because  how many percent ? Eighty percent ? user interface: They think it's ugly , right ? marketing: Would spend more money if it looks fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so use  very  lot of peo user interface: Perhaps you can  make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones . industrial designer: Adjust with phones , yes user interface: You can  But I don't think that  industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah sea view , yes , Simpson's versions and marketing: Yeah , see through version .  then we have  separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , industrial designer:  . user interface: but marketing: Or like  you have a menu button , you press project manager: No , we said teletext also a separate menu . user interface: Yeah , but I marketing: Yeah , or otherwise you have a menu button , press menu then you have  main  menu search  all the all the settings . project manager: So we're having a a general menu with the most used functions ,  teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? Like  large icons or small icons user interface: I don't know . project manager: and I don't know what else , marketing: project manager: but industrial designer: No . marketing: I think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen , user interface: Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote . marketing: I think the buttons Yeah , but but or like you have user interface: Which one ? marketing: you only have channel button or volume button . Those buttons you can you can project manager: Yeah , but on the L_C_D_ , user interface: But that's also in the L_C_D_ , project manager: huh ? user interface: right ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: So we don't have any normal buttons marketing: Yeah , th user interface: that  marketing: No , no normal buttons , yeah . user interface: Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno project manager: But we don't need a special industrial designer:  not button marketing: But I don't think project manager: we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself . If you have if you have  industrial designer: Yeah sure , of course you need  a settings button ,  or a settings option for the remote control . But isn't idea to use   what you said ,  normal on and off button for the T_V_ , that you don't have to use a marketing: No no no , because we we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically . user interface: Yeah but but not for the remote but for the T_V_ , that you use marketing: Yeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . user interface: But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , marketing: No . project manager: Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , user interface: yeah . project manager: because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . So how do you turn the thing on ? There has to be a on button on the remote , user interface: No you just tap I think . project manager: And then the television is on also , or just the remote ? marketing: No , just the remote . user interface: But marketing: A television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , industrial designer: Yeah , it should be in standby mode , but marketing: yeah stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then T_V_ should be available . I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just  rubber  for for T_V_ , marketing: Separate . Otherwise you I don't know whether or not that's industrial designer: A A A normal button on the remote control , user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: or norm ? user interface: Of or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: Yeah , because  when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . industrial designer: Wh  why would it be a a need to have a normal button ? user interface: Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you  you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want . marketing: Yeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button . industrial designer: I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use  if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . project manager: Okay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . project manager: Okay , well I guess we have to industrial designer: Oh , okay marketing: Yeah , if we can afford it . project manager: postpone further discussion to  our next meeting , because we're running out of time . Okay , well user interface: project manager: thank you very much , for now , marketing: user interface: Should we put this back in our rooms , or  ? industrial designer: Yeah , think so <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>project manager: If you Don't know if you al already had a look or not ? user interface: No n I I already did it . At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ? user interface: No that's that's for the trendy  feel and look . project manager: Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? user interface: project manager:  that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . project manager:  Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? industrial designer: Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then .  marketing: But we can keep it single curved with  top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . project manager:  then we have left user interface: But we don't have any basic options any more . industrial designer: And  'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well . industrial designer: And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click project manager: Yeah , some more menu options . user interface: Yeah we c could We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button  thing . I was Because marketing: project manager: Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button  industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: If you go to our  view , like you if you are in the sound system there ,  and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . industrial designer: But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: right ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . marketing: So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . marketing: But you still But you then still need to have Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for  maybe for the channels . user interface: So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . user interface: But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . project manager: So user interface: So we have to to make it s  more  It has to be project manager: You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . Wh wh what what what is the what is the  sample sensor sample speaker ? project manager: Oh , that's for the speech . project manager: S s Drop speech recognition ? industrial designer: No but project manager: Yeah that's possible . user interface: We we d industrial designer: Yeah it's it's expensive , but  we never considered the possibilities of  speech recognition . industrial designer: I marketing: No , it can be disturbed by by noise and industrial designer: No . project manager: marketing: There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we need a lot of marketing: But if it But it it it's a it's a both a hypers user interface: We lose our whole concept . project manager: Okay industrial designer: We  we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system , project manager: so we drop the speech . marketing: But y y project manager: Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button  v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button . project manager: Then you're marketing: And then and then use  project manager: Oh and the power button we have also . user interface: If we do  two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons . To This together is more expensive than Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . user interface: It's the marketing: For example if you have f f four buttons , channel up and down ,  volume left right project manager: Volume . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . user interface: marketing: So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . industrial designer: Which That's even marketing: But I see that's project manager: Yeah that's one Euro more expensive . marketing: Because which buttons do we have now ? Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then project manager: Menu , power .  industrial designer: Yeah , if you if you go to eight marketing: Which more ? industrial designer: I don't know how to project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display . marketing: Instead of r project manager: Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus  people . project manager: Yeah ? marketing: No but I I project manager: Yeah okay  user interface: That's an option . marketing: And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ? project manager:  that's easy because plastic is free . project manager: Yeah ? user interface: Yeah th th it's it's  marketing: Yeah we can't drop them . industrial designer: Yeah  marketing: Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ? industrial designer: You   Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . industrial designer:  can't we f  fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already . And then if w marketing: And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . project manager: No y you would rec marketing:  it's not that important , easy to use , but project manager: Then you have industrial designer: Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? project manager: Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . user interface: But the integrated  button ? How many func functions can it  have ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: You can go into you in you main menu , marketing: You you press it for like three seconds . You see ? industrial designer: We'll we'll be on marketing: But we still have thirteen left . project manager: Ah , I don't think I can s  persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than marketing: user interface: Okay . Wh what we could do is  drop the the special colour , and  do the special colour for the buttons . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah but  what is meant by special colour ? project manager: I just m I don't I think user interface: Just something else than than black or white I think . user interface: The display industrial designer: Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it . user interface: The But if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the marketing: Yeah . project manager: No I don't think the current status of  chips are pretty  energy conserving , no . project manager: Yeah hand dynamo ? Do you want an extra button ? marketing: Or or do we Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of project manager: user interface: No no it has to be curved . That's the most import project manager: Yep ? Instead of an additional power button ? user interface: Yeah or spe special form ? marketing: Yeah . marketing: Let's do it like this , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we project manager: Yeah ? Okay .  industrial designer: project manager: Did I save it ? industrial designer: It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . marketing: Yeah what's the next  phase ? project manager: Yeah , this the last phase of course , so marketing:  the agenda . user interface: marketing: project manager: Yeah it was more important , so I just marketing: Yeah . True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a scale , as we all know it . project manager: user interface: marketing:  Well the criteria are based on the user requirements ,  the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: right ? project manager: of course we dropped a little bit of those  marketing: Yeah the us u It it industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . marketing: So do you think industrial designer: Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: So on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? user interface: Two or three . If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . marketing: Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ? user interface: I think we are industrial designer: Yeah . You j you just push it in for user interface: It's in Oh yeah it was integrateds . marketing: Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah  on the other  on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no . project manager: It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but user interface: Can you  change channels directly with with just one button ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: No , you have to scroll through the menu , before marketing: With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . So it's it's not industrial designer: Well  we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if When it's on , yeah , it's turned on , project manager: You say you double click on the marketing:  ? industrial designer: It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some Of you marketing: Yeah . marketing: But but how do you change from volume to channel ? project manager: industrial designer: No because it has four arrows , right ? project manager: No , not anymore . marketing: So you you have to double-click , for ,  volume , project manager: To get into menu . marketing: So that's user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but that that's not a question . marketing: You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu .  the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . marketing: I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech project manager: Yeah definitely . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . project manager: marketing: But the look and feel project manager: You still have rubber d Or no . Because it's basically an old one ,  with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . industrial designer:  the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . user interface: It's the white part  industrial designer: Yeah but it be because  we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the project manager: . project manager: So user interface: We have a we have a industrial designer: So  I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . industrial designer: And even the shape we have now  simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , user interface: industrial designer: doesn't it ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . marketing: What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ? industrial designer: It's really not easy to use . user interface: industrial designer: 'Cause you're putting everything marketing: So a six , more .  project manager: marketing: user interface: marketing:  well , another question , user interface: Yeah that looks  great . Nah industrial designer: Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic marketing: But  In use , both battery as casing ? industrial designer: Yeah .  the last one ? The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . project manager: No marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . It's it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . marketing: But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so industrial designer: Yeah .  marketing: I all made it po I I all made it user interface: marketing: I all made it possible  for a positive questions , so we can count it . marketing:  if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , project manager: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Three plus ? industrial designer: I wouldn't be able to do it that fast . marketing: Yeah just use project manager: Start over ? user interface: No it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s s marketing: Oh there tho  there's no n There's no num pads . That's why it's  marketing: It's a it's a bit  industrial designer: Just type in the digits . project manager: So industrial designer: Yeah the lower the The lower the score the better , right ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ? project manager: No . industrial designer: I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . industrial designer: So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low the lower the better . But if you give true to a negative question marketing: Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those  those things , I guess . Nah it it's it's better than average , but industrial designer: Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour .  not on that , but marketing: Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this project manager: So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen . Okay  we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? project manager: Yeah  user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? marketing: Yeah . And then  over-paint it with   the green  project manager: The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . project manager: user interface: So that's marketing: Do we have to do other things ? project manager: Well I have to   make an  report of every decision we made so far . project manager: So I marketing: So you made a start , right ? project manager: Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me . project manager:  user interface: Okay , but how do we make the the scroll  button ? project manager: I was here . marketing: The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . marketing: The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour industrial designer: Oh Yeah we did our special colour for the user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ? marketing: How many pages ? project manager: I just took one for every step and then a conclusion . industrial designer: 'cause you can marketing: Okay , and and the look and feel is user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Is it more natural than this ? project manager: Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance . marketing: Where did we start with price ? user interface: Maybe m make it bigger ? Or marketing: Twenty six and a half . So we can make it  special ? industrial designer: Oh marketing: This ? industrial designer: What do you mean ? Like a other colour than this one ? user interface: Or or speckles in it ? I dunno .  marketing: Speckles ? user interface: industrial designer: Yeah can we do it   can we do a print ? user interface: ..$ I'm not sure . But industrial designer: I think we have to choose , yeah ? marketing:  industrial designer: Okay special colour . So industrial designer: Does it mean  that user interface: It's not very special , but  marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: How the We did we do that ? user interface: Oh it's it's just one computer ? Or marketing: Just dual screen . industrial designer: Where do you want some more dots ? project manager: user interface: Yeah , over here . user interface: It's  industrial designer: Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know . user interface: No , it looks industrial designer: It's not so random huh ? marketing: Lot of options . industrial designer:  it's not too  That's not their logo , is it ? user interface: No . user interface: Two R_s and a one industrial designer: It's a project manager: Yeah . Do we need to do anything ? user interface: Are we  ready ?  Or industrial designer: I hear you people are typing . user interface: Is this  the last assignment ? Or project manager: Yeah , it's  user interface: Final project manager: Yeah . marketing: What time do we have to deliver the report ? Four o'clock or industrial designer: At four , yeah , ? marketing: Or before that ? project manager: Okay . project manager: It's industrial designer: It looks like there's a It looks like a butterfly . user interface: No it's in inside the industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , and don't know how it's or eject it . project manager: From up there ? industrial designer: No , but it i It's not a bu a beamer . marketing: Yeah it it's a beamer , but then with a industrial designer: With a with a mirror , huh ? Or something . industrial designer: So are we gonna change anything to this ? user interface: It is industrial designer:  is it gonna marketing: Well it's it's single single curved . It's it's marketing: But it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice . No , you sh marketing: I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something . user interface: Maybe that's why it's it's not working , because it's more industrial designer: Slanted yeah . But th this one wasn't good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line and then it came over here . user interface: You have marketing: project manager: Oh , five minutes to the end of the meeting . industrial designer: user interface: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah , it's it's working , it's working . industrial designer: Yeah it's only a bit like to that side , but that is that one by the way . Yeah but it's better , it's better user interface: No it industrial designer: 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there . marketing: And then ? project manager: Then I have to   write this , marketing: We have to present project manager: and I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far . After after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or industrial designer: It looks like candle wax . marketing: Yeah ? project manager:  marketing: How do you do it ? project manager:  well basically what that says , we discuss it and  marketing: Alright . project manager: So how were did the project process  go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Or are there  industrial designer:  th  do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or project manager: Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth . industrial designer: But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . industrial designer: And the third time yeah ,  marketing: And we move more to to working together as team , user interface: No . marketing: because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . marketing: And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , project manager: marketing: and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . industrial designer: Yeah we marketing: The process , the interaction between us became better and better I guess . user interface: And marketing: Yeah , especially if f f if you see  you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess . marketing: industrial designer: Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that project manager: Yeah ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah but only the the financial parts  industrial designer:  marketing: Li Limiteded afterwards , user interface: Yeah . marketing: but If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . industrial designer: I marketing: Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of  industrial designer: We were pretty democratic . project manager: So and the  about the board digital pen ?  was that helpful or industrial designer: Yeah . marketing:   I think in in essence project manager: marketing: the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . marketing:    I've made yeah ,  I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . industrial designer: It's  it's The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . industrial designer: And  as I said ,  I  have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . You can give it a kind of a home style , like we have i the the logo and everything . project manager: Okay , are are there any new ideas about this ? All I think marketing: Well , it project manager: I didn't really receive , yeah . marketing: It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . project manager:   w  marketing: And and project manager: S sorry  marketing: the screen and stuff like that . The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint , so that you can just easily marketing: Yeah . user interface: industrial designer: Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . industrial designer: You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever . But it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience , and then to user interface: Yeah just for text , for text it's  it's okay <doc-sep>Sorry ? Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? Okay , we've got half an hour for this one  to  discuss the  functional design . project manager:  so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder .  kind of  got to know each other a little bit and  got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss  a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s  just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the The first one is that   the company's decided that teletext is outdated  because of how popular the internet is . Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . project manager:  they've also suggested that we  we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect  how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . So  , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . project manager: And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . marketing: And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? project manager: Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure   th because on the the company website ,  what does it say  something marketing: 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics . project manager: Yeah ,  do they Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext ,  only control the T_V_ , and  and  incorporate the  colour and slogan of the company .  so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ? industrial designer: Nope , we're all set . user interface: Alright  , can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ?  project manager: Oh yeah , of course , yeah .  Right to do the  the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us  some insp inspiration from previous products . user interface:  I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and  I would like to ask you guys for  your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . user interface: having a look at the existing products , I found out that  it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either  a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . It's got only the basic functions  but  it's the same size as the the hard to use one .  so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha from the bottom of it . marketing: M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've  read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of  sort of market research . marketing: But anyway , project manager: Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . industrial designer: Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. marketing:  clunky in what sense , like  h heavier ? Larger ? user interface:  I think it's supposed to be the same size , but  it's got much fewer buttons . It's , you know , it's very spread out marketing: I see , so it's more just basic .  like the one on the left looks quite  quite complicated , and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing .  so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , so maybe you know marketing: project manager: you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , industrial designer: project manager: I think that's a good idea . user interface: do we have any functions that  we'd want on it ? marketing: user interface:  so far I've got  on and off ,  switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . user interface:  they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ .  , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? Would you like marketing: Which was that ? user interface:  the channels like the the numbers on thing ,  marketing: Up the numbers , or the up down ? project manager: God , I wou I would say that's required , marketing: project manager:  there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , marketing: Yeah . project manager: what else ,  So don't need to worry about teletext , marketing: project manager: don't need to worry about V_C_R_ ,  any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , marketing: We don't ? No ? project manager: you know like brightness and contrast ? marketing: Yeah . Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? project manager:  . marketing: We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? user interface:  project manager: I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? user interface: to start with  sort of a bit both ,  we need to find out exactly what we have to have project manager: Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . project manager: so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and marketing: Yep . user interface: There's  on and off ,  volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .  marketing: Well , one one way I would look at this  would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of  like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . marketing:  and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . project manager: Oka marketing: For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up  , project manager: marketing: things like channel and volume  are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top ,  very just very sort of self-explanatory .  so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . project manager:  well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section Have I just lost Oh no .  ,  do you think maybe that's the only kind of  essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . project manager:  okay , industrial designer: project manager: if we can move on to next presentation then please . project manager: Do you wanna user interface: Do you want to switch places ? marketing: Can this can this pl reach ? Can this plug come across ? industrial designer: No . marketing: Here , I'll just Why don't I just user interface: Just just switch them . marketing:  er , can you go up behind me ? Kinda This is so This project manager: bit complicated . It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ? marketing: I'm all in a knot now . So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of  redundancy in the in the the issues and the the  the things . marketing: Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so  so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely . marketing: Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what  like market research  that that I've been project manager: Okay . marketing: So how do I how do I get this up ? industrial designer:  function F_ eight . Just  Before I bring this up what I'll just say is  what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing . And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what  , so . So  does that make sense ? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . So  I'm thinking here about  primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with  existing products .  to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics .  and then , as I say  w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and  project manager: industrial designer: Bouncing on top . marketing: So this is what I've found here ,  a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together .  the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for  slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . marketing: So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different  inspirations , you know , one is that we want  something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . This is  why I mention when Craig was  showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . industrial designer: Is installing a new remote control something that people marketing: no , that did not come up at all . And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . marketing:  people  additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can  put that into a unit which is which people like . marketing: Yeah , so you know just c looking at what what Craig  Craig's i  ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and  separate the different things that we wanna include in this . So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . That's s that's sort of the  But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . marketing:  I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . marketing: So Alright ? Any  comments on all of that ? project manager: Well ,  one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be  who's our our target audience , our target market . marketing: That's  project manager: so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? marketing: Yeah . Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , marketing: Yeah . project manager: well I don't I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . project manager: But you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one . industrial designer: I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? project manager: It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think . industrial designer: Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? project manager: Yeah , marketing: industrial designer:  so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . industrial designer: You know how much ? I dunno I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? project manager: Okay .  if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: would you how much would you pay ? marketing: This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . marketing: and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . project manager: Okay marketing: Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is . project manager: Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? industrial designer: Yep . user interface:  project manager:  do you think then  voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? What what do you think , Craig ? user interface: Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? Sort of the the older group . user interface:  f marketing: It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , project manager: N yeah . marketing: in terms of project manager: I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want marketing: Okay . project manager: and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . project manager: Just kind of young professionals ,  th like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . industrial designer: I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . project manager: You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . industrial designer: I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , marketing: industrial designer: I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five , marketing: industrial designer: but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . industrial designer: So these are people who are gadgety , right ? project manager: So marketing: industrial designer: People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: when you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular project manager: Yeah . project manager:  okay , so  industrial designer: project manager: so shall we make the decision  to include speech recognition marketing: If we can . industrial designer: I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , project manager: if we can . industrial designer: because  , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . Why is that ? industrial designer: You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . marketing: Could it be an on off thing ? industrial designer: marketing: Like if you want it on industrial designer: but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , project manager: Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . industrial designer: anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . project manager:  might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're marketing: Yeah , it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . marketing:  project manager: Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it  speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people  maybe with a physical disability as well . marketing: like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different  design features together project manager: marketing: that they user interface: I reckon one problem with speech recognition is  I've actually seen one of them used and  the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . project manager: Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? user interface:  I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in .  I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . industrial designer: We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down  exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like Besides the basics , I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target .  are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? marketing: industrial designer:  and I just the idea is just to get everybody to  I usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic , so , you know , things that to start everything going . But I guess everybody does have some idea , so I don't think  there's a need for that . industrial designer: from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need  in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . industrial designer:  and that power source is important because it ties you down to  how long the device will last . That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there .  Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . industrial designer: You know , and that  picks up an input from a user ,   a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . industrial designer:  and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . It's fairly general ,  and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , project manager: industrial designer: like  voice recognition , right , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . industrial designer: but  these are functionally , you know , the base , marketing: industrial designer: I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? I think that's more relevant to a discussion ? project manager:  . project manager: Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? marketing: Sure . Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing . marketing: And like on the means b industrial designer: I guess this would be marketing: Since we're on the topic of the technology ,  are there any like what are our options ? industrial designer: Yep . marketing: Alright , what's what i in Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin industrial designer: these these aren't technology options in that sense . industrial designer: For example , if you needed  if you needed to add  a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , project manager: industrial designer: but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter ,  and the receiver , okay , project manager: industrial designer:  and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . industrial designer:  there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . industrial designer: Okay ,  are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? project manager: Okay . project manager: Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect  how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about  how we transmit it industrial designer: Yep . project manager:  because  it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha industrial designer: There might be one other problem with the transmission ,  in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition .  if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . industrial designer: it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight  say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . industrial designer: but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process .  does c is our controller is it have the option of being  on a standard  frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? industrial designer: There's there's not much specific specific information , project manager: W industrial designer: but I think that  one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . project manager: In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , industrial designer: marketing: Just to T_V_ , okay . project manager: is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ?  is that something we really want to go into , do you think , industrial designer: There's a there's project manager: or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? industrial designer: Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , project manager: -huh . marketing: project manager: Okay , industrial designer:  and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . industrial designer: But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . So basically the  I'm just gonna just recap  what I said at the start , was that  the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , industrial designer: project manager: and what exactly the product's gonna do . project manager: Are we all happy about the idea of  aiming the product at  the fifteen to thirty five bracket ?  and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . project manager: user interface: I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . marketing: And is it going to include any of the  the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? user interface:  I think we include mute , but apart from that  I think we just we'll go for the simpleness . R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some project manager: Yeah , it's as optional functions . marketing: 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . industrial designer: Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ?  maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . industrial designer:  this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that  from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear , project manager: industrial designer:  it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off .  like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , project manager: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer: like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic .  so  I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , marketing: industrial designer: project manager:  for  our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept .  User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . So  I dunno , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . Andrew ? marketing:  yeah , just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of  sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . user interface:  just about the three buckets ,  what would go in the the device functions one ? industrial designer:  things like on off . Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but  you might wanna you know turn off the sound , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to  others or a device . project manager: Okay , so you're gonna have  audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi marketing: project manager: Okay ,  marketing: And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more industrial designer: Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . industrial designer:  even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . industrial designer: It's easy to use , I think that's one thing that  and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well project manager: Okay . project manager:  so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , industrial designer: project manager: because of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at <doc-sep>project manager:  I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , user interface: project manager: This is where we talk about  properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . project manager: So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it .  we had a couple of  changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything  and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .  we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and  a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal ,  . project manager: and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , user interface: project manager: things like that , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ? marketing: Shall I ? user interface: Yep . Okay  so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .  the methods we used to decide on  current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional  our usual market research study  with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im  w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , user interface: project manager: It's okay .  we decided on the most important aspect i  required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . Also with our company  being forerunners in  putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update  using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .  so the general findings from that was  in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . marketing: Okay , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group ,  we found from our  consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be  a trend towards a spongy feel to materials ,  again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . marketing: Unless anyone has any questions about that ? project manager: I don't think so , not yet . project manager: especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .  this is  all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .  also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available . This is  the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and  it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment . marketing: industrial designer: There's  actually no rechargeable option available , so we I saw the  the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , project manager: Wa can you explain that ? industrial designer: people won't it's it's basically like wind-up radio . marketing: project manager: How what kind of how l long can you get out of that , industrial designer: It might project manager:  can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or industrial designer: You Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_ . project manager: That doesn't count though does it ? marketing: Does does light charge as as sunlight does ? project manager: I thought it was U_V_ like industrial designer: No . marketing: Artificial light ? industrial designer: Is it ? Alright i project manager: Any , any marketing: Has to be solar . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space . industrial designer: Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . marketing: That's going to project manager:  people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people . user interface:  marketing: I know , industrial designer: But marketing: different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally . industrial designer: and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway . project manager: but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening . industrial designer: The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches project manager: Yeah I've seen industrial designer: and you d you don't even notice it .  the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . user interface: And are these like  what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ? industrial designer:  yeah it's it charges into  some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and  the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , user interface: industrial designer: And that'll that would l would last for  well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out . user interface: We c project manager: But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd industrial designer: Yeah and project manager:  you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . industrial designer: Yeah but then again project manager: Is it really gonna be enough ? industrial designer: I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's  it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side . industrial designer: And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it project manager: So it's not the draw on it isn't industrial designer: and you put it marketing:  . industrial designer: no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be marketing: marketing: Could I just ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with  standard batteries ? industrial designer:  . marketing: could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging industrial designer: Ye yeah I think I th  g y you could have a dual  power thing marketing: or the two things not compatible ? project manager: Like a dual kind of . industrial designer: but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . What kind of price are we looking at for industrial designer: They're they're expensive , they don't user interface: It's twelve point f project manager: I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? industrial designer: Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones ,  but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping , project manager: Solar . industrial designer: 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y project manager: Well they're not designed industrial designer: the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but  if remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .  calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do , project manager: You do get a bit of wear industrial designer: they can t project manager: but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ? industrial designer: Yeah they do , they yeah they've got dual things , but they're the batteries are smaller I think . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . user interface: A remote control , like , industrial designer: W m yeah user interface: so we have to s look at the life also . industrial designer: so the Yeah the the s if you if you had something du  using the standard batteries and the solar charging , I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last . marketing: It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , industrial designer: Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah . project manager: Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally project manager: Well add it in to think about  marketing: right , okay . project manager: because , where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: we're doing something original and different  but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much . project manager: But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: It's not something that's come up in any of our  focus groups and market research , project manager: No . industrial designer: my second part of my findings  the mo most current remotes use this silicone  P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two  different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then  gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts . project manager: What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of industrial designer: Well well this the thi the thing about is  they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , project manager: industrial designer: if you if you wanted to but  the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so that And then to  yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote , project manager: industrial designer: but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and  after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . industrial designer: the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing project manager: industrial designer: and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . industrial designer: which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this  spongy feel this year , so perhaps  some something made of rubber , marketing:  . industrial designer: but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ . industrial designer: I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said .  the problem with the casing is that  there's quite  there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units user interface: Second thing is project manager: Hinged , yeah . user interface: yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . user interface: So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . user interface: So is that feature available in like  titanium , industrial designer: Yeah I th user interface: or it's like only specific to plastic or industrial designer:  . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just marketing: industrial designer: it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is user interface: industrial designer: it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . marketing: I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , industrial designer: Rubber , yeah . marketing: that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . project manager: So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , marketing: Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah . user interface: Something like project manager: like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off . industrial designer: T marketing: Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to . project manager: Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not . industrial designer: just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen . industrial designer: Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .  the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin  and don't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch user interface: Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of industrial designer: display .  what what user interface: Just what you said I I didn't get the  meaning of it completely , you're saying like industrial designer: Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it user interface: -huh . industrial designer: the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: but  you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board . industrial designer: With W also with the marketing: I don't s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , marketing: yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah . industrial designer: but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside . marketing: Have I misunderstood you ? industrial designer: It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , marketing: industrial designer: so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ . project manager: I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . project manager: Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press ,  industrial designer: Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest . project manager:  marketing: I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . industrial designer: Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out project manager: Like one of the palm pop thing . user interface: Absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would industrial designer: 'cause I had marketing: Yeah . user interface: a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . marketing: Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a project manager: Okay , we'll talk about that so if you finish your industrial designer: Yeah that's project manager: and we'll come back to that . industrial designer: yeah that that's the end of m my project manager: That's you , right okay . user interface: And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . industrial designer:  you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , user interface: Okay . marketing: I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in . marketing: If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? project manager: No . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th  the remote control display thing . project manager: Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ marketing: Yeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph industrial designer: marketing: it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay . marketing: trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much project manager:  . industrial designer:  you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out , marketing:  . industrial designer: but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about marketing: Oh I think forget about the mirror project manager: Okay , okay . First thing is  basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said  , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . user interface: Like , some some people have a Here you see this ? This is on a I I I found th that  only common feature is the ch  channel control and  volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . user interface: Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: and g graphic user interface marketing: Sorry what does that stand for ? project manager: Which means user interface: basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , marketing: Okay . user interface: which is industrial designer: If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen . user interface: Like you have on a l  icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface . user interface: So basically not point or click Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . user interface: And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . user interface: So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . project manager: Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? user interface: project manager: 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone . marketing: No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you ? Isn't that the idea ? You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . That's what I was just saying , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li user interface: But project manager: and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top user interface: user interface: Okay and you mean to the project manager: so have the  the volume and the programme , things like that , user interface: And the lower distance . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g  s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . user interface: So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here . user interface: Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound marketing:  . user interface: and if this can be incorporated this would be more  you can say trendy also ? And technologically innovative also . My personal preferences would be like , as already  marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours ,  red chilli  marketing:  . user interface: tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide  industrial designer: Well , yeah we user interface: I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ? user interface: This is central one , the one you project manager: Or is that volume and channel ? user interface: yeah volume and channel . So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here .  I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about  the things we've discussed . project manager: that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Yeah I think project manager: It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a industrial designer:  if Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have project manager: selling point . industrial designer: and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them , user interface: So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun . project manager: I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , marketing:  . marketing: we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ? user interface:  . project manager: Do you want like a back-up ? marketing: No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? industrial designer: K no the kinetic ones come come with  a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . industrial designer: So it's a lot smaller , so it would marketing: Got you on that okay , didn't realise . The buttons what did you give us as our The bare-board L_C_D_ or industrial designer: Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , user interface: industrial designer: on the on the on on the top one we're gonna project manager: On the top one okay you've got the touch industrial designer: yeah . project manager: okay and then industrial designer: On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones . marketing: Sorry could you repeat that last part ? industrial designer: okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . user interface: For the body design I think plastic ,  w yeah industrial designer: Plastic , user interface: we could use the body , project manager: For the inside . user interface: for the inside and  rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . marketing: - , user interface: marketing: so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , user interface: Plast right . and it is just  although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , industrial designer:  no . user interface: It's project manager: we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway marketing: Okay . project manager:  the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it  psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , marketing: project manager: but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know marketing: The feel . Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , user interface:  I it's different . project manager: It's just different marketing: is that fancy ? project manager: it's just different from everything else and  , I'm trying to imagine  clean looking houses , marketing:  . project manager:  so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway , marketing: project manager: or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and industrial designer:  . I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but  I totally agree . marketing: This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more project manager: And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have  a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little marketing: Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming  it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , project manager:  . project manager: And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes marketing: which is another beauty of it . project manager: y you know , you could just go so far with it , industrial designer: You can you can just marketing: user interface: Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures . project manager: like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , marketing: project manager: so I think that's quite a flexible thing . user interface: And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , project manager: Yes . user interface: it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time . marketing: for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries ,  L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? user interface: Fine ,  we were talking of voice recognition also marketing:  . user interface: because that we are not for how to look it  remote control if it's lost . user interface: So , are we looking at voice ? marketing: Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost , user interface: Or maybe like  William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains . project manager: Have you user interface:  sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design . marketing: 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product project manager: Well they do , marketing: don't they ? project manager: but I think we can you could marketing: Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours . project manager: Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that marketing: Okay . Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? project manager: Depending on how i industrial designer: Yeah , depending on the expense of it . project manager:  we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so industrial designer: And they've got in stock , so yeah . project manager:  that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about .  user interface: Again a questionnaire huh ? project manager: so I think we've probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes marketing: You got to go through . user interface: project manager: It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took "

        "Query": "Did the group find the remote control competitive in terms of evaluation criteria, battery design, and cover when discussing the functional design and prototype of the remote control?",
        "Summary": "The team had mixed opinions on the remote control design. While Marketing found the basic layout to be dull, they praised the brilliant voice recognition feature. User Interface acknowledged that the remote lacked digits but had all the necessary features. The Industrial Designer reminded everyone that they could only design within their capacity. The Project Manager agreed that the remote was of high quality but had low acceptance. \n\nIn terms of the battery design, the team wanted it to be long-lasting, original, and conventional to ensure innovation, versatility, and durability. They also wanted to avoid deviating too far from the usual performance to prevent issues for new users. \n\nUser Interface suggested using a rubber cover that could stretch over the remote, and the Project Manager agreed, asking the Industrial Designer to explore this idea further.",
        "Article": " and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - <doc-sep>user interface: But  we don't  we don't  we do think it's  well what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers . And after a while they start to develop  some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . industrial designer: They n they need to understand what  how to change channels and  change the volume , so it's easier for them project manager: Could could I see the scroll bar as  as as a sort of shortcut ? A a and the voice recognition as well , industrial designer: Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's project manager: th maybe you could  could  industrial designer: Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our  . And and the case is is rubber ? industrial designer: Yes , rubber ? project manager: And the buttons ? user interface: Plastic or rubber . project manager: and  the colouring ? industrial designer:  yellow with  project manager: with with grey or black . project manager: Okay , user interface: project manager: we'll we'll come to that later . industrial designer: But marketing: Well , you could use two of them to programme the  channels on the two channel button , industrial designer: Yes , but it marketing: 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels . industrial designer: Or not ? project manager: M m but maybe you do want a programme button to  for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . project manager: Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Okay , well marketing: So  project manager: the then we'll switch to my presentation . project manager: Yeah , it's it's w way above   above the the the twelve Euro fifty . user interface: Why does the price and and the s oh , one  exa project manager: Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .  if you would user interface: And and does it project manager: if you look at the  w w w what we could do to make it more  to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty ,  then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells ,  by not using the voice recognition feature , industrial designer: project manager: I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out ,  user interface: So the button we can use plastic . user interface: And the pla  And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas  instead of rubber . industrial designer: Well , b basically it when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in  an enhanced case with these dull functions . Maybe we should look at an  focus on another  industrial designer: So Type of m maybe another market segment . project manager: Yeah , m  maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy    basic industrial designer: Yeah . Although I think we yeah , but we could still make  a remote control that ap   applies  more to young people  by giving it another colour already . project manager:  so it is possible to make   a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . industrial designer: Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . industrial designer: So project manager: Well industrial designer: Is it fancy ? project manager: I d it is it is marketing:  industrial designer: marketing: Yay . industrial designer:  I think  I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing . It would be even more project manager: You like tita user interface: industrial designer: oh , you really like titanium .  user interface: project manager: Yeah , I know , marketing: Is it  project manager: but but it but that's fancy in the way   fancy has has a lot of industrial designer: It has to do with fashion , I guess . user interface: It's trendy trendy , fun industrial designer: So do marketing: And w user interface: yeah . user interface: It's not the ultimate  fancy two , but industrial designer: I think I th I think it would have been I would have think  it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . user interface: Yeah , but that's sti that's  industrial designer: So user interface: Looking at the user  needs , we only  don't we don't have the double-curved case . marketing: Okay , and  was it innovative ? user interface: project manager: Well , marketing: project manager: with the voice recognition feature and  user interface: But that's not in it . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic  energy source , but it's it's way too marketing: Yeah , and  project manager: That would have been a thrill . industrial designer: yes , but marketing: So  also a  two ? industrial designer: I think  it's a two . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . industrial designer: So  It's maybe it's not very  easy for user interface: Wouldn't give it more .  two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ?  ease of use  does not only apply to the most basic functions . You're right in that , but I I guess  an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , project manager: Yeah . project manager: So I could make it e easy ? user interface: If you make it a four it will be three in general . Three ? marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Two ? marketing: two , two , three project manager: No , user interface: And a three ? project manager: I haven't said anything yet . project manager: Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . industrial designer: That's not even project manager: Does it will so it will be a two point five . marketing: industrial designer: But that's not possible to fill in , project manager: Yes , it is . It's not about the content , it's about okay ,  is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . user interface: we haven't re  re  really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . user interface: Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker  industrial designer: Yes . Maybe you have to  programme it once , so to that l respond to  a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . marketing: project manager: Well , I  industrial designer: So , I th project manager: we should not  stay too long on this subject  because of the time , but I personally give it a one . There are cases  in which the outside casing is  can be  how d how do you prono is is moldable . user interface: Was it one of our options ? industrial designer: No , it's not one of our option , marketing: No .  project manager: No okay , but but user interface: So , in the in industrial designer: but when you look in the market , when you look marketing: this this was a most spongy option . industrial designer: but that's not that's not  what they are talking about , I think . user interface: But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . industrial designer: Yes , but it's not good enough , project manager: I'll give it a one . industrial designer: You take one ? What do you give it ? marketing: Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could project manager: Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig  a number .  I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . user interface: project manager: Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? marketing: Well , the basic layout doesn't offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . project manager: What what we didn't talk about is   user interface: Yeah , but it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's If you  ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is it has all the features  a normal remote has . Bec because you can  we didn't talk about it , but you do have  remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . project manager: you place a a regular  remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the  the  the the signals . project manager: So you could    enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . But that that's its power , I guess , because  a regular programmable  remote control contains , well ,  really a lot of buttons . marketing:  I think think a one , 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like  industrial designer: Yes . I I've I think we've  succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . project manager: The product is is is  b high qua  has a high quality and and is  advanced . But whether or not our clients are are  willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure . user interface: But we could couldn't  what what's the selling price ? Fifty ? project manager: Twenty five Euros . industrial designer: That's quite ex user interface: That's price , but w w industrial designer: well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind ,  a Phillips remote control , y you pay  industrial designer: Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . user interface: Yeah , I kn I know  from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders . project manager: Bu but well yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are  remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros . industrial designer: And it's easier to use because those  remote controls don't offer voice recognition project manager: .  What did you think about  the process , the project process ? Ruud ? marketing: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: Try to translate that . project manager: Any any other  , Roo ? user interface: Yeah , I think  industrial designer: Well , I think marketing: Ye project manager: Roo . industrial designer: So And   the the the well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . industrial designer: So there was not really a process of  project manager: So we could we we could be we could've been creative . industrial designer: We we thought of possibilities who are not possible  with the the current  offer of  manufacturing components . project manager: Okay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ? user interface: No , no . project manager: I think so too , it's it's it's  of course a laboratory environment . So  user interface: marketing: project manager: Yeah , but but si  w w w when taken in account the the situation ,  I think we performed pretty well . project manager: Because of the response industrial designer: It it's project manager: or user interface: Response industrial designer: The response is very slow user interface: and industrial designer: and the possibilities are very limited . The p the pointing of the pen is not  the place where it it writes its   where it  marketing: Draws . project manager: Okay , so user interface: So  project manager: it it had to be  better aligned , or what's the word ? user interface: You to take in account that your you m project manager:  yeah . user interface: It's too slow project manager: It it was calibrated just before this meeting . industrial designer: It is ? project manager: So  it's not the calibration , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  Ruud , w  did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ? marketing: No . user interface: If it has O_C_R_ ,  I think  I would use , but  I I just  took notes for myself and and and that's it . user interface: So industrial designer: But I think it's a great solution for  for  a known problem ,  writing down some notes , some some inf  information , and then  forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . industrial designer: Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way .  What w  Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ? marketing: Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit , project manager: Yeah . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or user interface: Yeah . project manager: Or the other way around , that you could show but m industrial designer: Yes , yes . project manager: I know , but user interface: So it's almost project manager: I know , but we couldn't use that feature , user interface: yeah . industrial designer: And and  w you were when you're using  Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons ,  which you can use for drawing . industrial designer: user interface: industrial designer:  we're done , we're finished , I believe . Thank you for your industrial designer: But  how much time did we get for this meeting ? project manager: Forty minutes . project manager: So , we can  redesign our   I would like to industrial designer: Well , I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . industrial designer: No , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market <doc-sep>Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and  it looks like we've  done a good job here and  we'll just go through the the final  the final details .  okay , oh the  th the the minutes of the last meeting  I think we'll take those as read ,  Okay industrial designer: project manager: the  th the the next  thing we we we'll have a look at the  th have a look at the prototypes and  look at the  evaluation criteria and finance and then   just tidy up with production and  and then we can close . industrial designer:  okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just  you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically .  on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . project manager: industrial designer:  this is the power key ,  it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , project manager: Yep , industrial designer: or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . industrial designer: so you can you know talk to it like that project manager: Yep , industrial designer: and it'll still understand . industrial designer: and has the cover on it user interface: S industrial designer: and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything project manager: Yep , yep , industrial designer: and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . user interface: And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , project manager: -huh . user interface: and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , project manager: showing me age , user interface: so they kinda just stretch over . user interface: I I didn't know that but yeah they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery project manager: -huh . user interface: and that way you know project manager: Okay , user interface: spongy like is something that people wanted project manager: yep , right . user interface: and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well project manager: Okay . industrial designer: But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers user interface: and industrial designer: you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . user interface: and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . project manager:  tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered  h how will people put these down I wonder ? user interface: Like that . Okay for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically industrial designer: Yeah it could stand , yeah . industrial designer: Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit project manager: Yeah ,  no industrial designer: so it would stand like that . project manager: because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item industrial designer: Yeah , standing . project manager:   it it's  it it's just  it's just a minor detailed point , but  as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and  industrial designer: Yeah , we could just widen it out  project manager: Yeah and  it just needs another  another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them  industrial designer:  . project manager: because actually have several upon the  marketing: Could have one for your stereo , one for your D_V_ player . industrial designer: Have to if we just lengthen it I guess project manager: Yeah industrial designer: so it comes down to the base of the hand user interface: Yeah , project manager: but that that's  but  user interface: just kind of industrial designer: and then flatten it out project manager: no industrial designer: and could sit there . user interface: Somewhere like that project manager: no no ,  that's these  user interface: so it just sort of industrial designer: We might have to lengthen it marketing: Yeah I kinda had a a kinda a natural kind of a idea industrial designer: so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , user interface: Yeah . marketing: where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , user interface: Bu project manager: Yeah . marketing: yeah , kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant project manager: But  yeah but no th but the yeah the the the industrial designer:  . project manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah , industrial designer: The final product would actually stand up , yeah . project manager: I think the  the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and the i industrial designer: Wee project manager: it certainly meets our criteria of being  of you know looking different . industrial designer: project manager:  right let us  What's on the next one ? Oh right yes , let's have a look at the  f finance .  , now we're given a a clear design brief ,  if I get the  spreadsheet up . Good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the  the the the boss can understand . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: Now I've  this is the company's   costing for for various   aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly  liberally given the constraints placed on us ,  I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour .  , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that  we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I  I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so ,  that I don't think is a a serious problem . The  the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay .  then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to   l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept  we we should exceed the the sales targets .  it's simply made of plastic so th that's  that's no problem and   just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's   there's some cost there .  and  we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple   slider so  and the and the the buttons are   well I do don't know that they're special colour . Anyway the the costings  come in at exactly on target at twelve point five  but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that  what what we've got is is so in innovative and  and different that  any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the  you know the  you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers industrial designer:  . project manager: so   you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative  that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within  the constraints that they give , industrial designer:  . project manager: so  we we we present this as the  the company's  the the company's way forward and   I I think we can argue that we we have  come in on on budget . Does anybody want to   Andrew do you want what do you want to say about  the  yeah the evaluation marketing: Evaluation . project manager: where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ? marketing: The the product or the project ? project manager: The the the well the I meant the product . Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . So what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard project manager: marketing:  gauge our team response to these questions . And then at the end just take an average project manager: Tr On for true and seven for flase . marketing: Easy to use ? project manager: I don't see we could've made it any easier . And  , what else ? The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , project manager: Less buttons so it must be . We we industrial designer: Yeah marketing:  yeah it was our it was a industrial designer: it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . marketing:  will device appeal to all age groups ? project manager: I think it will because   old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so industrial designer:  . Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . project manager: well I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so industrial designer: I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups marketing:  . industrial designer: and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but  I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . project manager: It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's  industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah I think just the simplicity of it project manager: yeah yeah industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . user interface: and project manager: so I I yeah I user interface: not having to learn to programme industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , industrial designer:  . marketing: project manager: why not ? industrial designer: user interface: marketing:  can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ?  , yeah and what h did we make the management's project manager: in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions  is that yes it it meets the requirement industrial designer: project manager: is t it's television only , industrial designer: Yep . project manager:  it's it's it's within budget , user interface: Under the cost . project manager: coming up with what marketing: So  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . project manager: Before I  industrial designer: user interface: Ps I don't think so , project manager: No . user interface: and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make project manager: Yeah . user interface: and come to group consensus and project manager: Well that's right ,  th this this slide here  the satisfaction with  room for creativity ,  industrial designer:  . project manager: I think we've allowed ourselves  as much creativity as the  the the the product  allows . project manager:  I won't comment on leadership ,  teamwork I think we've  I think everybody's  worked pretty well together . project manager:  we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens ,  I think the results speak for itself industrial designer:  . project manager: and new ideas found , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very  very effectively come up with a a new  user interface: Yeah . Is the project evaluated ? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria ,  industrial designer: Yep . project manager: Thank you very much indeed , I think that I think that's  industrial designer: Cool , thank you , user interface: Alright "

        "Query": "What are the potential difficulties for researcher collaborations and networks after Brexit? How does the loss of funds due to leaving the European Union impact these collaborations and what are the possible solutions?",
        "Summary": "The impact of the Brexit deal on collaborations is still uncertain, particularly in relation to playing a role in Horizon Europe. Maintaining quality, impact, and growth in capacity is crucial for Wales. Dr. David Blaney believes that these efforts have already yielded positive results, such as increased research funding and a stronger presence in the international research market. However, the main challenge lies in securing sufficient funding. While the government recently allocated an additional \u00a36.6 million for research, this is not sustainable or adequate. The Welsh government has also expressed its vision for research and innovation, emphasizing the need for more investment in the Welsh research base to enhance competitiveness in accessing funding at a UK level.",
        "Article": "We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies, and I'm very pleased to welcome Angela Burns, who is substituting for Suzy this morning. Can I also welcome Si\u00e2n Gwenllian to the meeting? Si\u00e2n is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference. I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you? dr david blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between\u2014. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important\u2014delivery of that is going to be really important\u2014and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well. angela burns am: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves\u00a0looking like at present? dr david blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend. There's a difference between the distributable reserves\u2014I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have. angela burns am: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students\u2014it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before. bethan owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have. bethan owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that. angela burns am: So, overall, you're painting a picture of a sector that's under a significant degree of financial stress, and this is obviously using your key financial indicators. Do you monitor each and every university, or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is? bethan owen: We monitor, we receive forecasts, five-year forecasts, and we meet frequently with all our universities now. It varies, depending on the risks of the universities, as to how frequently we meet, but we're actually meeting with every university because even the forecast that we received last July, the changes, even in the 12-month period, are significant enough for us to need a better understanding of what the latest position is. Although it had a turnover and income of \u00a31.5 billion, which had increased, nonetheless it had a small deficit of 0.4 per cent of income in 2017-18, which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent, but notably, again, the sector in England were looking at surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the same period. The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that, for 2018-19, we should have a sector that's roughly in a break-even position, but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July, where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs, and there have been significant changes in pension costs, both for the teachers' pension scheme\u00a0and the universities' superannuation scheme as well, and those will be significant costs\u00a0that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income, certainly their fee income, is not increasing, and that is the challenge. angela burns am: Are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years? dr david blaney: I don't think so. As I said earlier on, we're not seeing a crisis, we're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage. At the moment, our sense is they are managing them, so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that, insofar as we can see it, we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they're facing, and are actually engaging those challenges properly, and we are seeing that at the moment. So I think what we will see if the pressure continues unabated is more costs being taken out, so more jobs being lost, more capacity being lost, but that's not the same as falling over. There is always the possibility of structural change within the sector, and that might be one of the solutions that institutions think about, but it's not a policy position, and it's not always a good short-term response to crisis anyway, actually. But I think, as I say, we're in a managed situation, but the challenges are quite acute. angela burns am: When you talk about structural change, are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close? I bring this up because I'm the Assembly Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and I have had multiple representations from students, and their parents, who are about to go to Lampeter and who've been told that courses are being restructured, there's a massive staff loss, and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained. So I am trying to drill down a little bit, because I think it's only fair for the students to know what they're up against, and also it's a bit like in the great depression\u2014you can start a run on something, can't you? Because if enough people believe it, then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university, really top-quality in medieval literature, in archaeology. And I'm just talking about one, but I know there are problems in other universities around Wales, so I just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as HEFCW might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes. So, if we look at the debate that happened in the Senedd last week, from my reading of the transcript, it was actually quite a balanced debate where pretty much every contributor made reference to the contribution that higher education is making. There was reference to the national student survey scores, and in many ways Wales is the best place in the UK to come and be a student, because you are looked after properly in Wales. But there was also a perfectly legitimate exploration of whether or not there's a crisis, and if you look at the way in which that was represented in the media, the crisis bit stuck and the rest of it didn't. At the point where the sector is trying very hard to recruit students, it's really quite unhelpful that you get that sort of representation. So we do need to make sure, I think, all of us, that we try to avoid a situation where there can be media amplification of a problem that's not actually as acute as the media are portraying it, and that is very harsh. I'm not being critical of the political process here, but it has ripples and we do need to be careful that we don't start a run on this. In terms of the specifics at Lampeter, we understand that there are no plans to close any of the departments, and there certainly will not be plans to pull the rug out from under continuing students. So there's an absolute obligation on them to meet their commitments, and that's a contractual obligation anyway, so it's a legal obligation. But we also have a quality machinery that we operate where we would expect institutions to be able to demonstrate that they've put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that students can finish their programmes of study. So they're not going to be recruiting students to programmes that they're not planning to continue\u2014they just are not going to do that. And if you think about it in a market context, it would be suicidal for a university to treat their students like that. angela burns am: But I have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in Trinity Saint David's financial plans. dr david blaney: Yes, I understand that, so let\u2019s come back to the material uncertainty. What I'm hoping to try and express is that we have absolute confidence that the institutions will not do the dirty on their students. They will look after their students and if they're recruiting to programmes, they are recruiting to programmes that they are planning to run, and run through to completion. And the expectations that we place on them in terms of our quality assurance machinery is precisely that\u2014when they are engaged in portfolio change, they have to look after the interest of the students that they currently have. In terms of our oversight and monitoring, our primary consideration, again, is the interest of the students. They are the people who have, in many ways, least influence over what happens in terms of the way an institution is managed. Although, they do have a voice and, actually, the arrangements for the student voice in Wales are, again, better than elsewhere in the UK. But, nonetheless, we do not wish to see students becoming innocent victims of difficulties of management and financing. Our institutional risk review process is fundamentally designed to make sure that institutions are grappling with their problems before they become a crisis. So, we have machinery, which has 70/80 different factors and hundreds of questions that we ask twice a year, to interrogate the performance of the institutions and to make sure that we are seeing them managing the issues that they're facing. So, it's not the challenges you face, it's the way you face your challenges\u2014it's a clich\u00e9\u2014and, at the moment, they are managing them, but if we were in any way concerned that they weren't, the people who are most at risk in that context are the students and we will be intervening to make sure that they were cited, and we do intervene when we have to. angela burns am: Well, following on from what you said, I've just got two really specific technical questions, then, to ask, because you said that you look across the whole scope to make sure that they are meeting all of their correct liquidity ratios and so on. So, considering how much is invested in their estates, are you happy that each university's estates strategy and its financing is prudent and has appropriate governing-body oversight in place? dr david blaney: Yes, so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution, so there is proper governance oversight. And in all of those instances, there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates. So, the machinery is in place\u2014 angela burns am: Because it's the big thing that drives most of university borrowing, isn't it? dr david blaney: Indeed, it is. angela burns am: So, if our universities are on a sticky wicket, we just need to know that the borrowing that they're undertaking is absolutely prudently assessed and is appropriate. So, as long as you're content, if I can hear you say that\u2014[Laughter.] dr david blaney: Okay. We're content on two fronts: one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that, but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing, they have to get our consent as well. And what we don't do is second-guess everything, but what we do do is make sure that the governing body, or its relevant committees, have been asking the right questions. bethan owen: Can I just add to that, then? angela burns am: Yes, of course. bethan owen: In asking for the forecasts, we have reinforced this year the importance of universities looking at different scenarios. So, to be looking at the demographic and maybe in the past, where there's potentially been growth in the system and universities have built that into their forecast, we have explicitly asked this year that we are provided\u2014not just the governing body\u2014with the scenario where there is no growth in the income. That's not the core forecast, but a scenario, so that it's quite clear how reliant the forecasts are on that growth, and if that growth doesn't come through, what the contingency plans are for ensuring that all the cost commitments can be met. And we should probably just differentiate between\u2014we have a role before borrowings are entered into, but all the best forecasts in the world can never quite predict, certainly what's happened in the last two years, probably, in universities. So, there are significant borrowings that are now committed to and the key measures we are looking at are universities' capacity to meet their covenants and their repayments under those borrowings, because that's essential for maintaining their liquidity. angela burns am: Which actually, neatly, thank you, brings me to my last question, which is: have any universities broken those loan covenants or been close to breaking them, unable to pay their borrowings as and when they fall due? bethan owen: There was a significant change in accounting standards in 2015, financial reporting standard 102, so most universities had to renegotiate their covenants, but it was because the accounts were looking very different. The accounting standards brought about changes in how income was recognised and how some service concession arrangements, largely student accommodation arrangements, and pension costs, significantly, were recognised in the accounts. So, most universities have had to renegotiate covenants, but we're not aware of any who've had to renegotiate due to covenant breaches, other than one which the University of Wales Trinity Saint David disclosed in their financial statements\u2014that they did need to renegotiate their financing arrangements, which they have done earlier this year, and they have now negotiated new covenants. It's a core part of financial management in universities now that you manage your relationship with your lender as well as with us. Breaching covenants in themselves is different to doing that with your lender being unaware and the factors being within your control. So, again, from that perspective, we have the covenants built into our forecasts, we require the forecasts to show how the university are planning to be within their covenants. The nature of those covenants vary, but most of them require a measure of cash flow, a ratio between the cash generated and the cost of debt, so there is close monitoring that is required because of the borrowing in the system, as well as our ongoing monitoring as well. Just before we move on to Hefin David, can I just ask you what your view, then, is on the statement included by auditors in the accounts of Trinity Saint David that there is material uncertainty? bethan owen: Yes, I'll pick up on that. The material uncertainty largely relates\u2014there is a note in the accounts that explains the factors that are being taken into account, but it largely relates to some significant cash receipts that have been subject to timing delays and the fact that the timing of these is essentially outside the control of the institution. The main delay relates to the receipt of funding for the Egin project, which was due to be received from the Swansea city deal. That funding has been delayed, but the sums due to the university are still due to the university\u2014it's the issue of the timing of those receipts that is causing a cash pressure. Just in terms of cash flows, all universities have to ensure that they are maintaining enough cash in their system to meet their payments as they fall due. Most of their costs are incurred on a monthly basis, staff costs in particular, but the income flows into universities are now less regular. In days gone by, that funding would largely flow from us and that would also come on a monthly basis. A quarter of that money comes in in October, a quarter in February, and the majority of it, half of it, doesn't come into the university in cash until May. So, that's quite a different cash management scenario for universities to manage; it requires holding cash balances to do it. Just before I bring Hefin in, we're going to need to have a bit of agility, as Dai Lloyd would call it, in our questioning and our answers if we're going to cover the ground that we need to cover. hefin david am: How can we be assured that governance arrangements across the eight institutions are sufficiently rigorous but also consistent? dr david blaney: So, the first point to make, of course, is that universities are autonomous, as you know\u2014 hefin david am: I've just written 'independent and autonomous'. The university governing body obviously is an important part of the machinery, particularly in terms of generating constructive challenge for the executive within universities. The governing bodies all are expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the guidance produced by the Committee of University Chairs, the CUC guide, which identifies good practice. Just in terms of governing bodies, it's also important that governing bodies engage in a process of continual refreshing, because that gives you a greater variety of perspectives, which is important. But it\u2019s also important they have people who understand the higher education business as well as from other contexts. But I think our view would be that when you get an increase in the contextual pressures that we\u2019ve been discussing already this morning, the role of the governing body actually becomes even more significant. So, we have encouraged the sector, both the chairmen of the university councils, but also the vice-chancellors, to engage in a process of an independent review of governance in Wales. And it hasn\u2019t been hard for us to encourage that\u2014they have been keen to take this opportunity to take stock. The Welsh higher education system is part of a UK system\u2014they don\u2019t want to be a million miles away from the rest of the UK in terms of expectations, but there is scope in Wales, given the scale of the sector, to actually construct something that is more challenging, I think, in terms of expectations, than might be the common denominator across the UK, and maybe some more exemplification. It\u2019s going to be quite hard to do this, but I\u2019m very keen that we engage\u2014and the sector are up for this\u2014in governance culture, because, actually, you can do process checks and you\u2019ll have the right structure of committees and have the right sort of papers going, but, in the end, it\u2019s the dynamic within that room and who\u2019s asking which questions and how well informed they are, and whether it's an open culture or is it a defensive culture\u2014these are really what influences the quality of decision making. hefin david am: And how different are those cultures across institutions? dr david blaney: I think it\u2019s very hard to say. Typically, that\u2019s at a point where there are sufficient difficulties going on that we feel that we need to\u2014 hefin david am: Do you have the option to observe at any point? dr david blaney: We can't insist, I don't think. But in the main, actually, our presence would change the dynamic of that anyway, so I'm not sure that's necessarily helpful. But we are keen to see what we can achieve with the sector in addressing these issues of what constitutes constructive challenge. Is your aim to see consistency in the same approaches, then? dr david blaney: I think we\u2019d like to see a consistent minimum set of expectations. In the end, it\u2019s about personalities, it\u2019s about people\u2019s background and it\u2019s about their knowledge. And we have a role to play in this as well, so we have a toolkit that we produce for governors, which, essentially, is a set of information that locates their university in the context of the UK, across a number of factors. So, if they had been told something that is not perhaps as true as it might be by the executive, they can see that in the data. Whether that toolkit needs a refresh\u2014I\u2019m sure it probably does, it\u2019s been there for a while now\u2014. So, part of that is what information we can provide to help governing bodies be properly informed as well. This is quite distant from Government\u2014unlike other institutions, where you can prescribe some of these approaches. dr david blaney: Yes, and in the end I don't think there's any pushback from the sector in terms of wanting to operate in accordance with best practice. hefin david am: So, what about risk appetite? Do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite? dr david blaney: I don't think so, and this manifests itself in two ways. So, we would see this coming through in forecasts, and we would see it coming through in requests for borrowings, predominantly. Our links into institutions are many and various, and we have our formal stuff, but we all have links into institutions that are informal and we\u2014. One of the beauties of the scale of the sector in Wales is we can see the institutions in a way that they can't hope to in England. But we have, in some instances, I think it's fair to say, helped institutions to think again about some of their aspirations. So, where we've seen things and we think, 'That just looks ridiculously optimistic,' we've just asked the questions. We don't say, 'No, you can't do that,' because they are autonomous, they make the decisions, but we try to make sure that they're asking the right questions. hefin david am: So, would you see that governing bodies are falling short in doing that themselves, in that, where they become strategic decisions that require due diligence, are the governing bodies themselves presenting that challenge? Or the fact you've just said that, does that suggest to us that, actually, they are falling short? dr david blaney: I think there's a mixture of things going on. We have a slightly different perspective and we have a perspective that is very intimately informed in terms of how the institution is performing. So, you have a governing body with a range of perspectives, and you will also have people who are very committed and very enthusiastic about the institution, and just occasionally it's helpful to get a slightly external perspective on these things. So, I don't think it's a shortfall as such, but I just think\u2014 hefin david am: The kind of honest broker role, kind of. dr david blaney: The machinery depends on having a body like HEFCW doing some of that role, and the people who lend money to institutions are absolutely clear about that. So, we have relationships with the banks; they come and see us every now and again\u2014typically not to talk about individual clients but just to talk about what we do and how we do it. Interestingly, for example, when Michael Barber got up before Christmas and said there will be no bail-outs of universities, we had banks on the phone to us within a couple of days, wanting just to talk about how it is in Wales and is it still how it used to be. So, it's not really a governance failure; it's just that the machinery includes us. And one of the things, from a distance\u2014, I've been involved in different ways in an institution, and looking at the institutions from a distance. Do you find that the relationships between executive teams and governors is effective, and are they sufficiently robust and challenging as well? Those executive permanent staff and the governors\u2014is there challenge there? dr david blaney: I would say, in the main, yes. Occasionally, we help the governors to ask the right questions, so occasionally that external perspective we've just discussed is helpful in that regard. Actually, there are times when there are tensions between the executive and governing bodies, inevitably\u2014that's not something that's remarkable\u2014and we can feel that as well. hefin david am: And that can become apparent from a public point of view as well\u2014you know, media reports and\u2014. dr david blaney: Yes, sometimes these things can spill, and the governing bodies also include student representation, staff representation, who are typically union reps, and so, you know, there are all sorts of\u2014. I'm not in any way saying that people are indiscreet, but there are all sorts of interests that are sitting around that table that have to be managed within a governance context. And these tensions are not all-out war, but there are sometimes differences of view and they have to be worked through, and that's governance working properly, I think. hefin david am: Okay, which is\u2014some of the work you've suggested will help towards that. hefin david am: And a last question: you've identified one university as high risk, five as medium, and two as low in the short to medium term. You're obviously not going to tell us which, but what I'm interested in is the direction of travel, and whether those that are 'medium'\u2014are they at any point at risk of becoming 'high' in the near future? dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales, and it's about the financial pressures that we've already discussed this morning. And that is why the efforts that the Minister has gone to to secure the Diamond settlement, and, indeed, other bits of money now and again, are so important. So, she's doing what she can, and that's really good, but we always knew that, between the point of the Diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation, there was going to be a valley to cross. So, the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure; there's a demographic dip, and there are the other contextual factors we've discussed. And the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really don't have to take out, because they don't want to reduce capacity, which they'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves. So, they are seeing deficits, which are managed deficits, where they're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in. hefin david am: And, if you're back in a year or two's time, the next few years, are we confident that there won't be more in the high-risk category? You said you don't see collapse, but are we confident there won't be more in the high-risk category? dr david blaney: Well, I think what I would always say about this process is that it doesn't guarantee 100 per cent accuracy. HEFCW is innately cautious as an organisation, so I'm not going to say we're confident, but that doesn't mean to say we're worried either. So, to answer my question: are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not? dr david blaney: We might. bethan owen: And, just to add, I think the key bit of that is maintaining the attractiveness of Welsh universities to students, because a large proportion are coming not from just Wales, but from England and internationally\u2014so, that's a key part\u2014and also that our research portfolio is invested in, and that also brings economic benefits. So, I think those are the two that we are [correction: need to be] able to maintain: the institutions as attractive options for students, and that our research capacity is invested in. sian gwenllian am: Just in the interest of transparency, are you able to tell us which universities are in which categories of risk? dr david blaney: We don't publish that; we publish numbers. hefin david am: They didn't even try to\u2014[Inaudible.] [Laughter.] lynne neagle am: Okay. Can you explain your overall approach to the 2019-20 allocations and what your priority for allocations has been? bethan owen: We publish our funding allocations, and we published the 2019-20 allocations on 4 June. For 2019-20, we're allocating \u00a3149 million, and, as David said, this is the first year that we've been able to start putting funding, additional funding, in from the Diamond recommendations for investment in the sector. So, that means we've been able to increase our recurrent teaching funding by \u00a37 million\u2014not a significant amount, but it's a start. And we have maintained QR, which is our funding for research, quality research, and postgraduate research, at least at the same levels of \u00a376 million, as it's been that in previous years. We've increased part-time funding by \u00a31 million to \u00a326 million, and we've started to increase support for expensive subjects\u2014that's medicine, dentistry and conservatoire provision\u2014and higher cost subjects\u2014those are the sciences and the STEM. So, we made a start on that and increased that support by about \u00a36 million to \u00a320 million in total. And, in addition to that, we have strategic funding that we're maintaining for Reaching Wider projects and the S\u00ear Cymru project. And then, in addition to our recurrent funding, we have had strategic funding in our remit letters for the last two years. So, we're developing programmes for civic mission, community engagement, collaborations between higher education and further education, and, more recently, we had funding at the end of March to start to implement the recommendations of Graeme Reid's report for research investment, and also for developing mental health and well-being. That strategic funding is very welcome, but to be able to build those activities into our core funding, which we hope Diamond will bring, would be more sustainable for institutions. How do your allocations to the 2019-20 academic year support and incentivise collaboration between HE and FE? dr david blaney: So, there are probably two dimensions to this. First of all, we have provided \u00a33.5 million of separate funding specifically targeted to improve and increase collaboration between HE and FE. So, we put out a circular inviting proposals for that, and it was competitive, so we funded what was the best of the proposals, and we constrained it to be available only to pump-prime new activity or to add value to existing activity, but not just to keep things ticking over. We had seven bids submitted from across the three Welsh regions on a whole range of activities, which we probably haven't got time to go into now. I've got a long list here, but, for example, in south-east Wales, the University of South Wales is leading on a bid partnering with Cardiff University, Cardiff Met, with the Open University and all the FE players in the region. We tried to get it within regions, because that's how you get the biggest impact for learners in the area and also for smaller enterprises in terms of innovation work. And then we direct fund a couple of FE institutions for delivery of higher education for historical reasons, and we also have our funding going through to support franchise activity between HE and FE. There are about 5,000 students who are studying HE programmes under franchise in FE colleges in Wales, and our funding method has, historically for some time now, protected that money. So, we try to prevent universities from taking the money out of franchise and onto campus, because we think it's important to try to encourage local provision within particular localities. And, certainly in areas where public transport infrastructure is perhaps not what it might be, for people to move to universities can be quite a disincentive, so\u2014. Then, finally from me, the council's remit letter for the 2019-20 academic year from the Minister does ask you to consider how you'd increase openness and transparency around the use of fee income. So, what are the issues here, and how will you take this forward? bethan owen: The reporting of the income and expenditure is largely provided, probably more so in narrative form in the accounts and the financial statements and annual reports of institutions. A number of institutions also provide graphs and more easily accessible information to understand the income and expenditure of universities. There are examples of good practice across the sector in presenting as simply as possible what the income sources are for universities and how they spend their money. And we're going to be working with the Welsh universities and sector bodies to improve the accessibility of that information for Welsh institutions. More transparent reporting of income and expenditure, and not just fee income, is actually very important for understanding how income cross-flows work in universities. Some reasonably simplistic analyses can assume that all the student fee just covers the direct costs of academic provision, but there's much more to the student experience than that, so there are costs: there are the infrastructure costs, the student support costs, even the community engagement and all the research activities bring benefits to the teaching and fee provision. So, more transparency of all the universities' income sources and expenditure and a better understanding of the income cross-flows and why you can't look at universities in isolation of student provision and research, you have to look at the whole\u2014so, we'll be working with them to improve that information. We're going to go to Hefin David now for some questions on part-time student funding. hefin david am: Part-time student numbers are bucking the trend in Wales, as I understand it, and we are seeing a bigger increase in Wales of part-time numbers than elsewhere in the UK. How is that going to be sustainable within current arrangements? bethan owen: We've allocated \u00a326.5 million in 2019-20\u00a0to support part-time provision, and we have been able in 2019-20 to fund some growth. So, there is growth in that funding to allow those institutions and incentivise those institutions who have recruited more students than last year to continue to do so. That came at an overall additional cost of \u00a31.9 million, and, based on what we're hearing from student support, we're expecting to see that requirement increase. So, it's one of the areas where we'll need to look at how we prioritise Diamond funding. And at the moment, our intention\u2014but subject to knowing the quantum of it\u2014is to continue to support and fund growth in part-time provision. hefin david am: So, is it possible\u2014? With the Welsh Government's policy of developing lifelong learning, is it possible that will be ever spread more thinly? dr david blaney: That is the challenge, and there's a piece of work that we have in our sights to look again at part-time and what it is and what the various drivers are. There's a temptation, I think, at times, to see it solely in terms of skills for an economy, and it is important for reskilling and upskilling, but actually, it's important for other things as well. If we see higher education solely in terms of skilling an economy, we've missed an important part of the contribution that higher education makes. But part-time is really quite difficult, because there's part-time that is about upskilling, part time that's about reskilling, there's part-time for social purposes, there's employer-supported part-time, there's student\u2014. dr david blaney: Well, there is a sense that they are more price sensitive, yes, and so the support regime that the Government is putting in place is important, and that probably has made a difference to the numbers of part-timers entering the system this last year. But I think we need to stake stock of what is important about part-time, what the market will deliver, what the market won't deliver, what we should fund and so on. And there's a complexity around all that, as I've indicated, which we need to do a bit of work on with the sector, with the student body as well, just to take some stock of this over the next year or so. hefin david am: Could we end up seeing significant fee increases for part-time students? dr david blaney: My sense is we won't. The Government wishes us to monitor, so we monitor, and that in itself is not straightforward, actually. There's a limit to how much a fee increase would be acceptable to the part-time market. I don't think we'll see massive fee increases; we might see a bit, but we won't see masses, I don't think. We've got some questions now on funding for research and innovation, and also we'd like to talk a bit about a replacement for European Union funds. If I could turn specifically to research, we know, of course, that both the Diamond and Reid reviews called for QR funding to be maintained in real terms, but the allocation is exactly the same for 2019-20 as it has been for the past nine years. Have you carried out any kind of assessment of the impact of this level of research funding on universities and, indeed, on the Welsh economy? dr david blaney: I'm sorry; I missed the beginning of that because I couldn't hear this headset. I was talking about the Diamond and Reid reviews at the beginning of my question and the fact that they had recommended that QR funding should be maintained in real terms. The reason the sum hasn't increased is because we haven't had enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations we have to other bits of the HE system. Both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid were very clear about the importance of being able to invest in our QR research funding, for a number of reasons. The capacity of the sector to be able to respond to funding opportunities elsewhere in the UK and across the rest of the world is itself determined by the size and the strength of the research base, which is sustained by QR funding. If they go for UK-based competitive research funding, that is typically constructed on the absolute assumption that QR will be part of that mix. So, they tend to fund to 80 per cent of the actual cost of the research, with the expectation that QR will plug the gap. And we know that, although the Welsh research base is extraordinarily productive, and really is punching above its weight in many ways\u2014and I mentioned earlier the impact of the research base in the last research excellence framework\u2014we know that, actually, it could do so much more, if it just had more scale. So, we fully endorse the reports from both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid that QR is important, and it's important also to be able to allow institutions to invest in research areas that emerge over time. It's almost impossible for a body like us, far less the Government, to know where these emerging strengths are going to come from, and QR provides the flexibility for institutions, which is absolutely fundamental to keeping the research base dynamic. sian gwenllian am: Therefore, you do have concerns that this isn't increasing\u2014you have that concern of a lack of increase in the level of investment. But has any particular assessment been made of the impact of not increasing that funding? dr david blaney: So, there is\u2014. Graeme Reid's report produced an assessment of the correlation between QR funding and capacity to generate funding from other sources, and there's a very close correlation\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Has HEFCW done any assessment to look at the effect of underfunding research, to all intents and purposes? dr david blaney: Not directly. sian gwenllian am: Your remit requires you to encourage universities to continue to develop one particular element of research, which is educational research. How does your allocation for 2019-20 contribute to that in terms of pedagogy and educational research specifically? dr david blaney: Bethan, did you want to say something on this? bethan owen: I was just going to add that, when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in Wales, compared with the rest of the UK, it's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in England, so the figures show that we receive less of the money that's available, which is a factor that results from us having less QR as a percentage, so we're in a situation where we get less of that UK funding that's available as well. sian gwenllian am: So, there's a knock-on to that; that's what you're trying to say. But from the point of view of my question on educational research\u2014? dr david blaney: So, we have provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education, which is a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities, specifically looking at educational issues, and we're providing additional funding to that to add value to the Welsh Government's existing evaluation of the progress of pioneer schools in developing the three-to-15 curriculum in Wales. I won't go into the full detail of it now, but it's a five-partner project feeding into this with researchers from Cardiff, Cardiff Met, Trinity Saint David, Aber, Bangor and the University of South Wales. So, it's a collaborative effort, and we have, in the past, also funded WISERD Education, so it's an important research facility and increasingly being used, I'm delighted to say, by Welsh Government in underpinning its own policy thinking. sian gwenllian am: And likewise, in 2019-20, there will be allocations specifically for this. Well, could you provide the remit letter from\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014do that? You have to do everything in the remit letters. dr david blaney: We do what we can to pay due regard to the remit letters, as the wording goes. sian gwenllian am: And then turning to the impact of the loss of funds were we to leave the European Union. Of course, this is going to have a far-reaching impact on future research, and the Reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact. So, what assessment have you made of how allocations will be able to help universities to transition away from EU funding? dr david blaney: So, again, the Reid review has done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of an impact assessment for us. There has been an additional \u00a36.6 million allocated for research very recently by the Government, which we have put out specifically in line with some of the recommendations from Reid. So, that's a start, but that's not sustainable funding, and it's not enough, really, but it is a good and welcome start. Reid was also not just talking about the money, but also talking about the way in which the Welsh research base both represents itself and also engages with UK-wide developments. And in response to that, we have recently issued our own vision for research and innovation, which was developed over a number of months, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations\u2014we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process? bethan owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund\u2014and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid\u2014is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide \u00a315 million back into the sector in innovation funding. sian gwenllian am: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some \u00a37 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too. bethan owen: That \u00a315 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI\u2014and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research\u2014that we need more funding to do the same thing there. dr david blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those. lynne neagle am: Okay, Si\u00e2n? sian gwenllian am: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups? dr david blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now\u2014we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over \u00a328 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer \u00a31,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales? dr david blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July<doc-sep>gareth rogers: Good morning, and welcome to today's meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. Unfortunately, the Chair is unable to attend today, so in accordance with Standing Order 17.22 I call for nominations for a temporary Chair for the duration of today's meeting. gareth rogers: As there's only one nomination, I declare that John Griffiths has been appointed as temporary Chair. Thank you all very much, and item 1 on our agenda today is introductions, apologies, substitutions and declarations of interest. We will move on then to item 2, and our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, and our first evidence session. I'm very pleased to welcome the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales here today, and Dr David Blaney as chief executive, and Bethan Owen, director of institutional engagement. I wondered if we could start off with you telling us what evidence you can see that the Brexit process has had any impact on Welsh higher education so far. dr david blaney: Can I preface the response by just reminding you that we are, by contract and by role, apolitical, and a lot of the judgments about the impact of Brexit essentially reflect where people sit politically in terms of whether they think it's a good thing or a bad thing? We're not going to go there, obviously, today, so we'll stick to the facts as we can see them, and hopefully we'll be able to help you, but there are areas where we are unable to help. But even in terms of your assessment of whether this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing, a good impact or a bad impact, some of that inevitably in the end becomes a matter of your politics on it, so we will be as careful as we can be on that. In terms of the impact of Brexit on higher education, clearly, the significance here is about the contribution that higher education can make to Wales. So, we fund provision; we don't fund providers, technically, although obviously there's not much provision without providers. So, we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers, but fundamentally the issue is: what does the HE system in Wales do for Wales, and what impact might Brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for Wales? So, we know that universities make annually about \u00a35 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And that, I think, just reflects the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that\u2014that's anecdotal\u2014but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult. In terms of the financial impact of that, clearly, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of the money\u2014we're almost immediately straight into politics if you're not careful\u2014but some of the money will be available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. It's not necessarily the case that Wales will always lose out in that relationship, but that will become a matter of politics. There's a broader dimension, which is about the economic impact of Brexit on the UK economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen.\u00a0We can touch later on on the extent to which they are sighted on\u00a0this and preparing for it. bethan owen: This is based on the UCAS\u00a0applications and the report that was published at the end of June, 30 June.\u00a0The European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales have decreased by 8\u00a0per cent, which contrasts with a 2\u00a0per cent increase for English institutions, and non-EU\u2014so international students, not from Europe\u2014have also decreased by 9\u00a0per cent to Welsh institutions, again contrasting with a 7\u00a0per cent increase in England. Could I then just ask you what you see as the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector at the moment? bethan owen: The funding position would be the main pressure. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of being implemented, and the changes to the student finance arrangements will take effect from this September. However, the recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer. That funding, when it returns to institutions, is intended to re-establish funding for higher cost provision, both full time and part time; reinstate funding for innovation; and maintain, at the very least, the research funding in real terms. Universities, in the meantime,\u00a0are trying to minimise the cost reductions that they're making in order to maintain the infrastructure, so that when the funding comes they can get the best value out of it. For the research and teaching grant, though, we are still funding at a lower level\u2014\u00a312.5 million less\u2014then the starting point for the Diamond report, the 2015-16 starting report.\u00a0But we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond. And it's probably important to note that the Diamond recommendations predated Brexit, therefore the challenges introduced by Brexit are in addition to those that the Diamond report was addressing. There is also the start of a reduction, both in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Wales. And the other pressures include pay and pension costs, not least the issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, where there's potentially a significant increase in cost. Increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure bring a requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing, which bring their own pressures. And finally, the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding\u2014the Augar review. john griffiths am: In terms of European Union students and enrolment, is Wales forecast to do less well than England and, if so, why might that be? bethan owen: They are not forecasting it. It's very difficult until the enrolments are made, and it's also very hard to see\u2014the data that we see is the UCAS\u00a0data. So, now, they have to find the full fee, whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as\u00a0Welsh students. So, I'm speculating that that might be having an impact as well on EU students' appetite to come. llyr gruffydd am: Well, that's straight into what I was going to ask, really, about what you think the factors are that led to this 8 per cent or 9 per cent drop in EU students applying to study in Wales, where we see a 2 per cent increase in England. Is that it, or are there other things that you've taken into account? What's your assessment of the reasons behind this? dr david blaney: It's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons, but I think there are probably two. The one that Bethan has already indicated, which is the change in student support arrangements for EU students, will have\u00a0an effect of perturbation.\u00a0That's probably relatively temporary\u2014let's hope it is\u2014as that settles down because, actually, the deal for EU students coming into Wales is no worse than that coming into England. Ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower, but we do struggle in Wales in terms of the\u00a0Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. The other dimension is that when you're in a highly competitive recruitment market, you have to do what you can to look attractive. Part of that is about being able to invest in facilities, and\u00a0particularly buildings and kit, and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that. Certainly, anecdotally I know, from my own family, that a lot of the choices have been made in terms of the state of repair of campuses and so on. There's something rational about that, isn't there? If you've got a system that is relatively better invested, then you're likely to have a better student experience because the resources are likely to be better. We saw a sort of similar but opposite effect when the \u00a39,000 fee maximum limit came in, and some institutions, mostly in England\u2014there was one in Wales\u2014chose to pitch their fee levels really quite low, relative to that \u00a39,000, and caught a cold in the student recruitment market because fee levels denote quality in the student mind.\u00a0So, the price sensitivities work quite differently. So, again, if you've got a relatively better invested part of the system, then that might well be one of the reasons why it looks more attractive. llyr gruffydd am: That latter factor would affect the whole of the cohort, not just the international recruitment, of course. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to that because that's re-balancing where the policy of investment goes. mark reckless am: If I heard you correctly earlier, you said that the applications from non-EU students were also down by 8 per cent or 9 per cent. So, forgive me a certain scepticism\u00a0about the explanation of the fall in the EU students being that they did get the fee grant and now they do not. If that's the explanation, why are we seeing the same fall in non-EU applications? dr david blaney: Well, I think the Welsh domiciled are also now having to face the prospect of finding a loan for the whole of the fee. There's also a demographic dimension here with the downturn in the 18-year-old school-leaver profile, and that actually is happening in Wales at a slightly later point than in England. mark reckless am: But this is non-EU students, and I think you said, Bethan, an 8 per cent or 9 per cent fall in them as well. mark reckless am: All English or all Welsh? bethan owen: Well, I contrasted the Welsh position with the English position where they were seeing growth. If you look, then\u2014and we don't have the detailed information, but, again, what UCAS publish is some analysis by tariff. They analyse by type of institution\u2014in other words, the grades that you need to get into institutions\u2014and there is a trend for growth being in the higher tariff institutions. So, there's a mix effect in there as well, and I think there's undoubtedly an element of perception of how welcome overseas and international students are, and that's something that we know the sector are working on with Government. mark reckless am: Why would that affect Wales\u00a0more than England? Do you think there's been perhaps too great a negativity about Brexit in the sector? bethan owen: I think it's the mix of institutions that we have. When we look at the mix of institutions that we have, we will probably see a differential impact between Cardiff University and others. john griffiths am: Okay, Mark? Sorry, David, did you want to add anything? dr david blaney: I was just going to say that we would expect to see quite differential performance in the English sector, so the overall numbers are being brought up by substantial increased performance with some of that sector, and it's a question of how many of that type of institution you have in Wales. mark reckless am: So, performance is increasing amongst the English universities, but not amongst the Welsh, you think. dr david blaney: I think performance is increasing, but increasing substantially with some of the English sector, not all of it. So, you get an average for the sector that is increased performance, but actually the stronger players within that sector, with the stronger international profiles, are bringing that up, and we have fewer in Wales that have that sort of presence. darren millar am: Would it be fair to say, then, that the universities over the border in England are better at selling themselves internationally than our Welsh institutions? Or is it just this fact that we've got fewer very high tariff universities versus the English market? dr david blaney: I suspect, and this is speculation\u2014I suspect that it's a bit of both. I would then come back to the point I was making about the Anglocentric nature of the UK media. darren millar am: But, forgive me, don't international students just look at the UK as a whole? How are we comparing to Scotland, for example, or Northern Ireland, in terms of their universities? Do you have a comparative figure for Scottish universities? bethan owen: I haven't got that one with me for now, but there will be one in the data. bethan owen: Again, it's a combination of being part of the UK but differentiating, and the ability to differentiate the strengths of Wales, so attracting those students to Wales specifically, on top of the UK draw. dr david blaney: So, in terms of the efforts that have been made, there's a programme now that is being run by the sector in Wales\u2014it's 'Study in Wales'. But that is a determined collective effort to present Wales as a good place to study, with particular messages about what distinguishes studying in Wales from studying more broadly in the UK. In a sense, that is responding to the need to increase the presence of Wales in an international market. It will take a while to actually have an impact, but I think that's exactly the sort of work the sector need to be doing more of. mark reckless am: What are those messages on why prospective students should study in Wales? dr david blaney: One of them in particular is relative safety. We know that one of the considerations, particularly for parents of overseas students, is are they going to go to a safe environment, and we know that the perception of international students who study in Wales is that this is a comfortable and safe place to be. That's partly a function of the size of our larger cities\u2014quite a lot smaller than many of the cities in England. So, we've got a UK-quality system, a UK degree, and the strength of that brand is available in Wales, but it's available in a way that is safer and more supportive, I think is the messaging that's coming through. darren millar am: I just wonder to what extent you have been able to plan in your financial forecasts for the next few years ahead for the potential impacts of Brexit. What have you built in, if anything? bethan owen: In terms of our funding, we receive our funding annually, but the sector provides us with financial forecasts, and we use those for monitoring sustainability. We are due to receive a full forecast at the end of this month, and we obviously have updated information from institutions. darren millar am: And they're three-year forecasts that come through to you, aren't they? bethan owen: They are four plus the current year.\u00a0So, we've got numbers to 2019-20 at the moment, and expect to go to 2020-21. darren millar am: And what are the universities expecting? What do they anticipate? bethan owen: Well, for 2017-18, which is the year we're about to end now, they were expecting \u00a338 million income from European students, and approximately \u00a391 million from the various European programme funding sources, and that's about 8 per cent of the total income\u2014\u00a31.5 billion\u2014of the sector. The forecasts are assuming that that continues, albeit that institutions\u00a0have various scenarios that they have for all sorts of scenarios that we can all speculate on, and, as I mentioned earlier, the balancing act of maintaining infrastructure and\u00a0resources and staff in the short term is where we are at the moment, or where the sector is at the moment. And there are also signs that the banks and lending institutions are becoming a bit more risk-averse in providing borrowing to institutions, and of more differentiation between individual institutions being made than has possibly been the case in the past. The sector made an operating deficit, again looking at all Welsh institutions collectively last year, 2016-17, of \u00a317 million. And we're expecting a similar collective level of deficit for this financial year, if not slightly higher. Now, these are managed deficits and we are not currently seeing critical short-term cash availability issues in the\u00a0sector. However, the increase in funding from Diamond is a key part of enabling the sector to return to longer-term financial sustainability. You can manage in the short-term, but there comes a point when the big cost reductions and\u00a0infrastructure reductions have to be made. And, again, having mentioned the pressures on pay, pensions and other challenges, it is difficult to gauge whether, if those factors come into play as well, some of these cost reductions may have to be made before funding comes in to replace\u2014either Diamond\u00a0funding or the European replacement funding. darren millar am: So, would it be fair to say that, in terms of the funding arrangements, and, in terms of the student numbers, one reason why we've got this recruitment\u00a0problem is this lack of investment in the capital infrastructure that we've\u00a0seen in recent years because of the\u00a0financing arrangements from the Welsh Government, and the fee regime that we had previously, and\u00a0the student finance regime that we had previously, not getting more cash into our Welsh universities perhaps, and that, over the next few years, there's going to have to be much more significant investment in capital if we're to raise the game and be more competitive, yes? bethan owen: Yes, that would be fair to say. darren millar am: So, to what extent are they planning for more capital investment\u00a0in those financial strategies that they've been preparing and presenting to you? bethan owen: They are all planning for capital investment. This year, 2018-19, is the first time that we've had capital funding in our remit letter\u2014so, we've got \u00a310 million of capital funding, which is very welcome, with a prospect of a further \u00a320 million. That will make a difference, particularly\u00a0to those institutions who are not finding it as easy to borrow from financial institutions. However, there are internal governance processes that are putting tight restrictions and\u00a0expectations of what that money will be invested in. But they all have plans to do it and they\u00a0need the confidence that their forecasts and long-term future funding prospects are secure enough that they can get the confidence of borrowers then, and service the costs of those borrowers. What clarity is there from the Welsh Government at the moment in terms of how much they anticipate the Diamond dividend will be, and what proportion of that\u00a0is going to be released to HEIs in the future? bethan owen: I was very carefully not describing it as a dividend\u2014a re-establishing of funding that we had in the past for higher cost and innovation and maintaining research funding. The timescales are difficult, because we have an annual remit letter, and we can work with Welsh Government officials, and they can only give us a sense of when they think the funding will be released. But 2018-19 is\u00a0the start of the system, and because of cohort protection\u2014so, protecting those students who came in on a different deal to the deal from 2018-19\u2014in the early years there is an element of double cost; there's a cost of seeing out the old system and the different cost of implementing the new system. So, at the moment, we're certainly not in a position to tell the sector with any degree of certainty what funding would be beyond what we've allocated for 2018-19, with some sense of what 2019-20 numbers we're working with because we allocate our money over an academic year\u2014so, by definition, we've already made assumptions of four months of the 2019-20 funding, albeit that's not approved yet in the budgetary process. darren millar am: But you're not being given a steer at all as to what you expect the additional resource that you might have to make available to Welsh universities might be as a result of Diamond. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say that officials have been as helpful as they can be with us, in terms of the planning assumptions we make and indications about whether or not we are being too ambitious or not ambitious enough. So, I think they're being very helpful; as Bethan said, they're constrained by the process\u2014they can't pre-empt a budget process. The other question I think you asked was how much of the money released by the new arrangements will come into higher education. At the moment, we are expecting all of it to come into higher education, as the product of the arrangement between the current Cabinet Secretary and the current First Minister. The extent to which any changes there cause that to come under threat is something I can't judge at the moment. But we have had in our remit letter from the Cabinet Secretary a clear indication that we can expect our resource to grow over the next few years, as the Diamond process unfolds. llyr gruffydd am: Bethan said in an earlier answer that, I think, the financial forecasting from universities forecast something pretty consistent in terms of what they're hoping to be\u00a0receiving in income, for example. So, does that tally, really, or are they going to be recruiting additional students from the UK market or\u2014? What's the plan? bethan owen: I was\u00a0reflecting on the last point when we had consistent information across the sector. bethan owen: I'm expecting that the forecast that we get at the end of this month will reflect the reduced applications we've seen, and an element of that will be reflected in reduced improvements\u00a0as well. So, we don't really know, then, whether\u2014it's unlikely that they are going to expect a consistent fee income, really. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say we would expect them to respond to what they're seeing in the UCAS process. Even if they didn't, they would all, in any case, have sensitivities for what they would do if things don't come out in the way they hope. And if they didn't have that then we would be on their case, of course, because we want them to be properly sighted. darren millar am: Can I just ask, in terms of the impact of Brexit, have you done any assessment of what you think might happen, or have any of the institutions made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions, going forward? You've mentioned scenarios earlier on, David, so what scenarios have you set out? dr david blaney: There's a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, which is chaired by one of the Government directors, and we sit on that. And we have provided that group with early summaries of the risks and the potential impact, in terms of the exposure of the sector to EU-sourced funding. We have, as part of that working group, explored those issues that it would be really very helpful for either the Welsh Government to try to put in place or for the Welsh Government to persuade UK Government to do.\u00a0And I think, in our submission,\u00a0we identified\u00a0a number of areas of what we would consider to be a helpful action, and that has been worked through that working group. We know that it has informed Welsh Government's position, in terms of what it does and also in terms of the conversations that they have with\u00a0Her Majesty's Government. Beyond that, what we haven't done in that working group is share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would\u00a0respond to different scenarios. We are not able to do that here either because, inevitably, they would have varying\u00a0degrees of unpalatability and they would have to be managed very, very carefully. You take cost out, which is essentially the response, you actually take people's\u00a0jobs out, and all of that\u00a0has to be managed carefully. So, that's not really a matter for public consideration, but we do know\u00a0that the institutions\u00a0are looking at a range of scenarios on what they\u00a0would do. Bethan mentioned earlier\u00a0on that the\u00a0current deficit for the sector is a managed deficit\u2014it's not something that has taken\u00a0them by surprise. They are responding to what they\u00a0see as the dip between where Diamond was reporting and where the money starts flowing. Similarly, I think we're comfortable\u00a0that there is a managed approach\u00a0to the scenarios that they're testing within institutions. The bigger issue really, in a public policy context, is the potential damage for the sector to be able to deliver for Wales in terms of research and skills development\u00a0and all the other contributions. darren millar am: So, you're confident that they're taking a robust approach\u00a0to planning\u00a0for various scenarios, going forward, are you, as individual HEIs? dr david blaney: Yes, and as the deal becomes more clear politically, then they will obviously have greater\u00a0clarity in terms of which of these scenarios\u00a0they need to work up more fully, but they are sighted on it. Can I just ask about fee and access plans, and how Brexit might impact them? To what extent\u00a0do you think that they\u00a0could be impacted? dr david blaney: I think there are two dimensions to maybe touch upon there. So, we're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year. We, as part of that process, go through similar\u2014we look at their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts\u2014data to the stuff we've just been discussing. And\u00a0also, of course, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types, from different domains, are going to be recruited. So, clearly, if there is a continuing downward pressure on EU student recruitment, then that will reduce the amount of fee income that's going to come in, unless they can find other students, and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans. If institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality, then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan. If it's not fundamentally different, but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later\u2014. We also monitor after the event and, if there are differences, we would then obviously require institutions to explain those differences. Conversely, if they'd had more students, and potentially more investment, we'd want to know what they'd spent it on, and if they've done different things, we'd want to understand that as well. The only other thing that's perhaps worth saying is that, in the 2019-20 fee and access plans\u2014they're not published yet, so I can't give you the full detail\u2014five universities have made reference to Brexit and the Brexit impact, and things they want to do through their fee and access plan to try and address some of those issues, so they're in there as well. darren millar am: But we've already said, haven't we, that it may be nothing to do with Brexit, this dip in EU recruitment, because there are other factors like the attractiveness of the estates and the environment that young people might be educated in? But they're making assumptions that it's linked to Brexit, are they? dr david blaney: Not really. There are things they want to do to enhance and to protect\u00a0student mobility, and some of that will be funded through fee plan investment. So, the Brexit conversation between the EU and the UK Government might or might not sustain\u00a0Erasmus engagement, and if it doesn't, then they need to find other ways of trying to support that sort of thing. What else do you do to assure yourselves that Welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning\u00a0for Brexit? bethan owen: We've touched on contingency plans, but, in an environment\u00a0of uncertainty, I think it's difficult for any of us to know what the right scenario is. I think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios, what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding. So, we touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales, so more focus on marketing Wales overseas, but also within the UK. The other area where the sector is working at a UK level very hard is making the arguments to UK Government for maintaining access to the successor to Horizon 2020, which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructure\u2014students is one part, but the whole funding infrastructure\u00a0for maintaining research capacity. So, working with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions\u00a0are doing. That group, which is the Welsh Government\u00a0group, is being advised by members on it, and that's informing Welsh Government officials when they engage with UK Government\u00a0as well. mark reckless am: Do universities seek your advice on what the risks and, indeed, opportunities of Brexit may be and what you think they should be doing to plan for them, or is your role more one of monitoring what they do as opposed to advising what they should do? bethan owen: They are autonomous institutions and ultimately\u00a0their governing bodies are responsible\u00a0for ensuring their sustainability. It's not a relationship\u00a0where we would advise and direct, but it is a relationship\u00a0where we would question the scenarios if we consider from our experience that we would have expected other scenarios to have been tested. mark reckless am: I understand you don't direct, of course, but my question was about advising. You're overseeing, or monitoring\u2014or whatever you like to describe the role as\u2014quite a number of institutions, and presumably you therefore have particular expertise within your organisation, and I just wondered whether higher education institutions are doing enough to draw on that. bethan owen: I think we can advise\u2014we can advise based on data and information that we can see. The big thing in this whole\u00a0Brexit scenario is the uncertainty and the extent to which our speculation is better informed than the governing bodies or the sector collectively is probably the issue. So, there's a relationship\u00a0with the sector and there's a relationship with individual institutions, and they are different. So, some of these conversations are happening in various ways, where we're all gaining intelligence about what might be a sensible set of planning assumptions. Then, if we see an institution that is manifestly giving signs of not being sighted on some of these risks, either through their forecast or through other assurance\u00a0activity, we will challenge. We have an annual cycle, with two points in the year where we reassess the overall risks of individual\u00a0institutions, and that's based on a whole range of hard data but also a range of soft data. We have lots of conversations and we take all of that in the round and form an assessment about the financial sustainability of the institutions but also the extent to which we think their governance and management arrangements are properly sighted and facing properly the challenges that they face. In some ways, we say it's not about the challenges they face; it's about how they face the challenges. Our alarm bells really ring when we get the sense that, actually, either an executive or a governing body hasn't really noticed. There are medium-term real challenges, both because of Brexit and because of other contextual factors, but at the moment the sector is a managed sector, which is good. It's not always like that, but we're in, I think, a good place at the moment. So, our role is definitely to challenge where we don't think they are making sensible assessments, but it's not to say that their assessment is wrong and ours is right; it's just to have a conversation\u00a0about, 'Why have you done this and what has informed your thinking?' It's slightly more one step back and slightly more subtle, but it is, as you imply, us using the intelligence we gain from all of those conversations when we talk to individual institutions as well. We had evidence last week from some of the higher education institutions, including Cardiff University, and it's very interesting, in relation to Erasmus+ and the mobility funding for students that, I think, only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in Cardiff is paid for by Erasmus+. I note that you've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator. I was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments\u00a0to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that. bethan owen: Again, reflecting on the latest fee and access plans, seven of the universities are referring to mobility\u2014either they have targets in them or are explaining what their plans are\u2014so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income. However, Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan\u2014if we were looking at a scenario where that infrastructure wasn't available, to implement anything similar to that would be much less efficient and much more costly. Ideally, you'd want something that all Welsh institutions could take part in, and that takes some investment and some co-ordinating. I think it's easy to underestimate the accumulation of time that has gone into establishing Erasmus. llyr gruffydd am: And the point was made clearly last week that the brand is internationally recognised. When you enter into Erasmus+, you know exactly what you're going to get, and all of that. But there have been criticisms as well about degrees of flexibility and this, that and the other, so I'm just wondering whether\u2014and there is presumably going to be some change on that front although I'm hoping we can buy into it, as others have done who aren't in the EU\u2014that emphasis on encouraging institutions to look more proactively at funding their own mobility efforts would be positive. dr david blaney: I think the\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Sorry\u2014especially if it means that they do more of it. I think the Welsh sector is definitely committed to trying to find ways of promoting and resourcing that sort of mobility. There are signs that some of the restrictive elements of the Erasmus programme are going to change anyway, because that's under development and that's positive. There have been positive noises as part of the Brexit negotiations about wanting to carry on being able to access the Erasmus programme. Nothing is agreed until it's all agreed apparently, so we'll have to see on that one. That would be far better, I think, as Bethan indicates, than trying to replace it with a made-in-Wales only, but you could have a made-in-Wales on top. All of these challenges also create opportunities because they stimulate thinking, and so the fact that seven of the eight universities\u00a0are already now using their fee plans as a vehicle for thinking about this is positive, and I think we can take that on from there. llyr gruffydd am: Because that 40/60 split struck me as being the opposite to what I perceived\u00a0the situation to be. A key\u00a0part of your role is to work in partnership with students, so I'd just like to ask what work have you done with students, in terms of maybe protecting their interests as the Brexit scenario evolves? dr david blaney: Well, as you say, we do work with students. We were the first of the funding councils\u00a0in the UK to have a memorandum\u00a0of understanding\u00a0with the National Union of Students in Wales. So, we have close links with NUS Wales and we're very proud of that, and it's very productive. We we're, again, ahead of the rest of the UK in requiring all HE providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter. The UK-wide quality code also has elements in it where arrangements have to be specified about the protection of student interests. That is particularly, in essence, around circumstances where a provider gets into difficulties and they might wish to close a course or something more drastic and then what arrangements are in place to make sure that those students who are in train are protected. So, that is there and we've worked hard with the sector and with NUS Wales to get those measures in place. There's more development work in train at the moment, so we've asked Universities Wales to construct a protection that takes account of the approach to protecting the student\u00a0interests in higher education. We're also requiring\u00a0further education institutions\u00a0who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same, and that's very important. The students who are HE students in FE are absolutely not second-best, and they should have the same protections. llyr gruffydd am: But is all this a general piece of work? It's not Brexit-specific, although, no doubt, it may\u2014. The other dimension around Brexit is the immigration status of EU students, and that's, kind of, beyond our pay scale\u2014that's a UK Government issue. llyr gruffydd am: Is that something that you have a view on? dr david blaney: It's clearly in the interest of the enrichment of the curriculum\u00a0and the student experience for students in Welsh institutions to be able to have students from other EU countries\u00a0in the mix. Now, of course, you have a statutory duty as well to assess the academic quality of the work in our higher education institutions, and I'm\u00a0just wondering\u00a0what potential impacts you think that Brexit might have on that particular aspect. dr david blaney: I think there are possibly\u00a0a couple of things to say, and one, in a sense, echoes what I was just saying in the final part of my previous response, which is that part of the quality of the student experience\u00a0is the richness that you get from having students in your cohort who have different backgrounds and different perspectives. So, if there is a continuing\u00a0reduction in the number of EU students coming into Welsh institutions, then that richness deteriorates. That doesn't\u00a0mean to say that the base or the threshold standard of what's required for a degree will come under pressure, it's just about the richness on top\u00a0of that, which will be, in a sense, a quality-enhancement issue. That would be something that we would wish to try to protect against, but in the end you can't force EU students to come\u2014you have to try and look attractive, and we've touched on that. The baseline requirement assessment\u00a0of quality will not be affected by Brexit, except in so far as the machinery we use to discharge\u00a0our statutory responsibility, which is through the Quality Assurance Agency, which themselves\u00a0are accredited\u00a0with\u00a0European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, the European machinery\u00a0for higher education quality. And there's a set of standards around that, and we would obviously wish not to be in a position where our ability to use and adhere to those standards is adversely\u00a0impacted upon. Those\u00a0standards will still exist, and it will be possible for the British system to adhere to them, even if they're not actually able to play in the same way. Then the only other thing I would\u00a0say is that one of the factors that can cause\u00a0the quality of the learning and teaching experience to be likely to become inadequate is when institutions come under financial pressure, just because their capacity to maintain the same sort of student experience can get under pressure. So, clearly, we will be looking for and making sure that institutions manage the financial pressures, if there are any\u2014and there are some at the moment, as we've described\u2014and manage those carefully. And in all of that, we will expect institutions to do their duty to make sure that the commitments they've already made to students are carried through. So, where students have already started on the course, they need to be able to finish that course\u2014you can't just pull the plug out. A lot of what you've told us in the last three quarters of an hour or so will have costs attached, depending on the impacts. Certainly, we're in choppy waters as a sector anyway, and the risk is that things will be even more choppy, if you'll excuse that level of political interpretation, over the years to come. I'm just wondering what advice you might have given the Welsh Government in terms of what level of transition funding, or Brexit transition funding, might be required by the sector, and if you have, what the Welsh Government might have told you. bethan owen: I mentioned earlier that, obviously, we've provided information in terms of the assumptions that the sector are making on income. I think the extent to which that needs to be replaced or supported with transition funding depends absolutely on what the final arrangements for Brexit are, but it's an appropriate point to refer to the report that Professor Graeme\u00a0Reid has produced, commissioned by Welsh Government. But, again, the Reid recommendations in that report build on the Diamond recommendations, and as soon as\u00a0Diamond is in place\u2014and Reid is providing recommendations in addition, to establish funding on the basis that the funding needs to be available in Wales to maintain and develop and strengthen the research and innovation infrastructure that we have. llyr gruffydd am: Are you not worried, though, that the clock is ticking and that we really don't know what the situation is at this point? dr david blaney: Do you mean the Brexit situation? llyr gruffydd am: The Brexit clock, yes. dr david blaney: Uncertainty is unhelpful, because as I've said several times, the sector is a managed sector at the moment. We're not seeing maverick stuff, but actually you can only manage, really, what you can see and what you can reasonably predict. So, the longer the uncertainty persists, the more difficult that is for institutional management and, indeed, for the rest of the machinery to support them. darren millar am: Chair, can I just ask a question? john griffiths am: Yes, Darren. darren millar am: In terms of uncertainty, though, we've still got this uncertainty over whether the extra cash that the Government's going to have to spend as a result of Diamond being implemented is coming to the HE sector. They've given a political commitment, but you've got absolutely no other assurance of the sums of money that are coming in. We've got the reform of tertiary education arrangements in Wales, which are also under way, so it's a bit of a perfect storm for you, isn't it, really, with all of these three things happening at the same time? dr david blaney: We're certainly kept busy. darren millar am: But two of those things are in the gift of the Welsh Government to sort out for you, aren't they? dr david blaney: Well, the policy on the reform of the post-compulsory sector absolutely is a Welsh Government policy. The extent to which they can pre-empt a budgetary process and give us clear sight of the amount of money in future years is\u2014. My understanding is that that's difficult for them to do, and I would repeat what I said earlier: officials have been as helpful as I think they can be in respect of that. , you're right, we've only got a political commitment between two people currently in post. darren millar am: that statement about the savings accrued from Diamond being reinvested wholly into the HE sector has not been repeated, frankly, has it, since the coalition deal was struck? dr david blaney: No, but it hasn't been rescinded either, so\u2014. darren millar am: No, but there have been opportunities\u2014repeated opportunities\u2014in the Chamber, where the Cabinet Secretary's been asked to repeat that commitment, and the First Minister's\u00a0been asked to repeat that commitment and has not given that commitment. That must concern you, and must concern your university sector even more than, perhaps, some of the elements of Brexit that we're discussing. dr david blaney: Bethan has outlined earlier on in this session the fact that institutions are currently running deficit budgets in order not to lose the infrastructure on the assumption that the Diamond money will come in. If anything were to cause significant perturbation, either to the timeline of that or to it coming in at all, then there would be much more of what Medwin Hughes calls 'houskeeping' that would be required, and that would be significant. So, at the moment\u2014I don't like the expression 'valley of death', but there is a valley to cross, and I think the sector is reasonably confident about how wide and how deep that valley is. So, there are several valleys that they're crossing\u2014the metaphor fails, doesn't it, really, but I think you get the drift? So, there are a number of challenges and they can see their way out of some of those challenges, but if any one of these starts to get significantly disrupted, then that would be a real issue for them. Could I go on to ask about other barriers to Welsh universities gaining more funding from UK research councils? What would you say those barriers are? dr david blaney: Well, I think there are a couple of things, really, to say. The first one\u2014and we'll sound like a stuck record if we're not careful\u2014is that there's an issue about investment and the Reid report makes this very clear. So, he has reaffirmed research that had been done previously that identifies that, actually, the quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them, and that, in the end, is a product of investment decisions. They have particularly looked at the deficit\u00a0in science, technology, engineering and mathematics areas, and I always say that research is not just STEM. , STEM is important, and I'm not denying the deficit in that area, but we have to also remember that the research agenda for Wales is not just STEM\u2014it's arts, humanities, it's social sciences. The Welsh impact in its research is better than anywhere else in the UK, so that's good. So, they do very well, and we just really need to invest a little bit further\u2014so continue to do very well, but put it on a broader front. If you want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, then the investment has two dimensions to it. One is just having enough researchers to be able to play into those increasingly larger projects rather than small-scale projects. If you haven't got the critical mass, it's very hard to make the case that you can play. And the second thing is that UK-wide research pots nearly always fund at about 80 per cent of the total cost of the research, and the other 20 per cent is meant to be found from the core research funding for the university, and if you're in a situation where your core research funding is not competitive, then you're not going to be competitive at getting that money. I think it's fair to say that the Welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils, making sure they're in the various committees and so on. We are intending to do a bit of work to see if we can systematise that a bit better\u2014that engagement\u2014because there's no doubt about it: it's not to say that this system is in any way inappropriate, but the more you're in the conversations, the more likely you are to be better placed to respond to the research challenges that come up. One final question: in terms of the researcher collaborations and networks that exist, do you see potential difficulties after Brexit for the continuation and enhancement of those, and are there any particular lessons to learn from\u00a0S\u00ear Cymru II? dr david blaney: I think that there are two things to say here as well. First of all, the Brexit deal might or might not impact adversely\u00a0on the capacity of Welsh and, indeed, UK research infrastructure to play into broader collaborative activity across Europe, and, in a sense, that's a function of the deal whatever the deal looks like, and we'll have to wait and see. But we've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe, and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity. It's not just the money, it's being in the club and it's the signalling that we're in the game. And then the other part of my response to this would be that, actually, Wales will need to continue to be good at the research it does, so maintaining the quality, maintaining the impact, and hopefully growing\u00a0the critical mass. The S\u00ear Cymru initiative has been quite important in doing that, because it's been very focused, capturing key research players, and the attractiveness that that has then to other researchers around them, and to industry collaboration, and they have been areas of real strength that we've invested in. And I think they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding, and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market. darren millar am: Just very briefly, one of the pieces of feedback that the committee members received at a stakeholder engagement event, which took place prior to this inquiry starting, to receive oral evidence, was about the research funding that is available from the charitable sector, and how poorly Wales does in attracting some of that research. I think we had some figures from the British Heart Foundation, which said they have \u00a3100 million a year available for research grants, or something like that, and we're getting 1 per cent of that coming into Wales, which is\u00a0obviously pretty low down. I appreciate that research into the type of activity that they want to put their money into, Wales may not be\u00a0particularly good at, and there may be other opportunities with other charities and partnerships. What work are you doing in order to build the capacity that Wales has to attract more of that charitable sector research funding into Wales? bethan owen: One of the issues is the capacity to engage with that funding,\u00a0because of the overhead issue that David mentioned. Again, that could be built in to our funding, if we had the capacity to increase our quality-related research funding. darren millar am: But that pressure's the same in other parts of the UK, is it not? So the overhead funding is still an issue in England, and in other places. bethan owen: There is an increased contribution, and I think it's an element that was increased this year to acknowledge that. I'm fairly certain that some of our institutions will be very strong with the cancer charities, possibly not the heart foundation. darren millar am: So, this gearing issue that you mentioned earlier on, for every \u00a31 that somebody else puts on the table, they can draw in another \u00a34 on top, because that \u00a31 will cover the overheads, whereas the rest of the research cash\u2014. You know, we sometimes get into a conversation about the unhypothecated nature of our research funding, but actually that creates a\u00a0flexibility and the infrastructure investment that allows institutions to be able to respond to these other opportunities. Without that, they can't do it, because if you're not careful, you've got\u00a0institutions engaging in UK-wide or charity-based research activities where they're actually having to pay for it themselves\u2014they're running at a loss. darren millar am: So that's the main problem; it's not that Welsh universities aren't doing their best to get this cash in. Or is it a bit of both? dr david blaney: I think, in the main, universities and researchers will get their cash from wherever they can, so I don't think it's a lack of appetite. Well, thank you, both, for coming in to give evidence to the committee this morning.\u00a0You will be sent a draft of the transcript, to check for accuracy. Okay then, the next item is item 3, papers to note, the first of which is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education\u00a0on the school organisation code. The second is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from the Chair of the Finance Committee regarding scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget\u00a0for the forthcoming financial year, which we will be discussing under item 6 on the agenda. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on parental attitudes towards managing young children's behaviour. And\u00a0the final paper to note, paper to note 5, is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care\u00a0on the children and family delivery grant, which we will discuss later on in private session, if Members are content. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to exclude the public from the remainder of this meeting, and also for items 1 and 2 of the 20 September meeting"

Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name, and please direct your remarks through the chair. For those joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by video conference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their mic and state that they have a point of order. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Chair, I have the honour to table, in both official languages, a report entitled \"Democracy Matters, Debates Count: A report on the 2019 Leaders' Debates Commission and the future of debates in Canada. Chair, on behalf of all of us, I want to thank the Right Honourable David Johnston for his continued service. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that you please come to the front and drop off your certificate at the table once the petition has been presented. It would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent by the donor. It also creates a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill is designed to confront and address the horrific practice by which, in certain casesfor instance, inside Chinaminority communities or dissidents may be targeted and have their organs removed as they're killed and used for transplantation. Petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204, and they want to see it passed as soon as possible. Chair, I am presenting a petition today signed by Canadians who are concerned that Bill C-7 removes safeguards from the current euthanasia regime, including the mandatory 10-day waiting period. Chair, these people who are signing this petition would like to see an improvement in assisted living, not assisted dying. It asks that the Government of Canada recognize the Republic of Somaliland as an autonomous state that may result in foreign investments, direct access of development aid, foreign aid for disaster relief and infrastructure development investment loans. fayal el-khoury (lavalles les, lib.): Mr.Chair, I thank the government for the way it has managed this global crisis and its impact on Canadians. Canada is one of the few countries that has acted in the best interests of its citizens and maintained their dignity in these uncertain times. While addressing Canadians, our right honourable Prime Minister showed us leadership, the importance of transparency, and integrity. His top priority was saving lives, along with finding realistic solutions regarding the economic impact on our daily life. Because of his outstanding leadership, we're admired across the world, which is another distinguished privilege of being Canadian. dave epp (chatham-kentleamington, cpc): COVID-19 has emptied food banks across Canada, even in an agricultural community like Chatham-Kent, so Wes Thompson and James Rasmussen, along with Alysson Storey, Randi Bokor, Maureen Geddes, Chris and Terry Johnston, Jason King, Fannie Vavoulis and Brent Wilken, grew an idea into the community's largest-ever food drive. Project manager Morna McDonald estimates that over 3,000 volunteers ended up helping in the May 16 Miracle. Residents put non-perishable foodstuffs on their doorsteps, with drop-off centres organized for rural areas. They accidentally exceeded by over 20% the record in the Guinness World Records book for collected food in a single day. chris d'entremont (west nova, cpc): As much as I like seeing my friends on the big screens, there are no big screens yet, so we don't know who's on and who's not on. Here in Surrey Centre, and across Canada, the Filipino community makes important contributions to our cities and has helped shape Canada into the vibrant multicultural society that we all know and love today. Now more than ever, during these challenging times we must come together as Canadians to celebrate the rich heritage and history of our Filipino neighbours. Throughout June, please join me in celebrating our fellow citizens of Filipino descent by recognizing all the incredible ways in which they have contributed to making Canada a better place for all of us. yves perron (berthiermaskinong, bq): Good afternoon, Mr.Chair. Today is World Milk Day, and I would like to recognize the exceptional work and dedication shown by everyone in the industry. Let's take part in the local consumption movement and rediscover the exceptional products of our dairy producers and processors. Enjoy the yogurts, cheeses and other products because it's true that milk is good. I would also like to thank BrunoLetendre, outgoing chair of the Producteurs de lait du Qubec, and I congratulate the new chair, DanielGobeil. The first step must be the direct allocation of import quotas to processors, and the second must be the full payment of the promised compensation. angelo iacono (alfred-pellan, lib.): Mr.Chair, June is Italian Heritage Month. The situation is special this year, since Italy has been hard hit by COVID-19, with more than 30,000deaths. Like me, many Italian Canadians still have family and friends in Italy, and the news has sometimes been very difficult to take, yet that has not detracted from the great co-operation that exists between Canada and Italy. During the pandemic, Canadians of Italian descent have been united to support anziani, our famiglie and our amici in Italy by participating in the fundraising campaign COVID-19 AiutiAMO lItalia to support the Italian Red Cross response activities. I send a special salute to to my cugino Giuseppe, who is still on the road to recovery from COVID-19. Chair, I would like to acknowledge all of the organizations in Saskatchewan and across Canada that are working hard to help small businesses adapt to the challenges of the current pandemic. As soon as the pandemic hit, RDBID launched a daily electronic newsletter to keep their members informed of support programs, local initiatives and local success stories. They have used their social media channels on a daily basis to promote takeout and delivery services, online and curbside services offered by restaurants and retailers. Through persistent communication and a lot of long hours, RDBID has helped businesses in downtown Regina to weather the storm. stphane lauzon (argenteuilla petite-nation, lib.): Mr.Chair, high-speed Internet will be to the 21stcentury what electricity was to the 20th: an essential service. I would like to reassure the citizens of my riding about the efforts that we are making as a government, but also about the work I've been doing as a member of Parliament since2015 to connect the 41municipalities of ArgenteuilLa Petite-Nation. Aside from this essential service, our students, seniors, entrepreneurs and telework are very important to the regions. We have heard you, and I will continue to fight for you, so that you can have access to affordable high-speed Internet. Chair, a few days ago, we all watched with horror and outrage the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of the police in Minneapolis. For many of us, these images may seem shocking, but it's an all too familiar tale to millions of black people not only in the United States but also here in Canada, in my city of Gatineau and around the world, who must at times live with the scourge of anti-black racism.  Mr.Chair, I can't know what it's like to be black in our society. What I do know, however, is that you and I, and everyone in this House, have the power and the responsibility to make our country more just. Black Canadians and all those who have to endure racism and discrimination are watching us, and they expect more from us. eric duncan (stormontdundassouth glengarry, cpc): Without a doubt, these past few months have been challenging, to say the least, from both a health and economic perspective, but, Mr. Chair, I have to say how proud I am of my community of StormontDundasSouth Glengarry. We continue to successfully flatten the curve in our region and, just as importantly, we are making sure that we are here for each other, whether it is the Cornwall Optimists' GoFeedMe campaign, the Iroquois-Matilda Lions Club delivering groceries to those who are quarantined in their households or the local United Way, the Social Development Council or the Carefor seniors support centre co-leading an effort to deliver 1,500 baskets to seniors in need. I rise today in the House of Commons to say thank you to my constituents and to all Canadians; to our essential front-line workers, our service clubs and our businesses that have stepped up to help out; and to everybody playing their part to get us through this challenge. I couldn't be more proud of my community and my residents, and it is an honour to serve as their member of Parliament. Chair, although Asian Heritage Month has just passed, we recognize the tremendous effort of all Asian Canadians on the front lines of this pandemic, as health care providers or as essential workers. I want to thank the many Asian organizations for donating to ScarboroughAgincourt's hospital, long-term care homes and food banks. As a Canadian born and raised in Scarborough, I'm offended by the reports of violence and vandalism targeting Asian-Canadian communities across this country. In budget 2019 we invested $45 million to launch a new anti-racism strategy, which included the establishment of the anti-racism secretariat, because these efforts are unfortunately clearly still needed. As events continue to unfold in the United States, it is important to recognize that we have work to do here as well. Whether it is anti-black or anti-Asian, racism and discrimination of any kind have no place in Canadafull stop. richard bragdon (tobiquemactaquac, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Over the last few months, Canadians throughout New Brunswick and across the country have stepped up to support their community. Health care workers, truckers, farmers, business owners, pharmacists, grocery store staff, faith-based and non-profit organizations and so many others have all answered the call to do their part. Chair, I would like to specifically highlight the work of those who support and take care of our seniors, who are among some of our most at-risk citizens. It has been said that the character of a nation and its people is revealed most in how they treat their most vulnerable. Whether they be long-term care staff, personal care workers, health care professionals, family members or volunteers, thank you for all you are doing in support of our seniors. Although we've come to the end of Asian Heritage Month, I'd like to acknowledge some unsung Chinese Canadian heroes who shed their blood as patriots for our nation. I commemorate the 6,500 Chinese Canadians of the 9,000 railway workers who helped build and unite Canada. I pay respect to the many Chinese Canadians who died while building the CP Railway on the most dangerous terrains in the B.C. Adult children should not have to call their elderly parents to tell them to stay home because they might be attacked by racists. There's no justification for racial slurs, physical violence or vandalism against any individual or community. I will continue to work together with other elected officials, the police and the RCMP to mitigate these issues toward justice and restoration. charlie angus (timminsjames bay, ndp): Ten years ago today, Cree youth leader Shannen Koostachin was killed in a horrific car accident. She was only 15 years old, yet in her short life she became the voice of a generation of first nation youth who were no longer willing to put up with systemic discrimination. Shannen never lived to see the school that was built in her community, but her work carries on through the Shannen's Dream movement. xavier barsalou-duval (pierre-boucherles patriotesverchres, bq): Mr.Chair, for months now, thousands of consumers who need money to pay their bills have been fighting against airlines and the government to have their rights respected: three class action suits, a unanimous motion by the National Assembly and over 30,000signatures on a petition calling for reimbursement for cancelled flights. Air Canada, which confiscated $2.6billion from its customers, received more than $800million from Ottawa without any conditions. Yet, the company has a year's worth of cash in reserve, $6billion in its coffers, and is in the process of raising more than $1.4billion in the financial markets. alain rayes (richmondarthabaska, cpc): Mr.Chair, I want to pay tribute to a great man who represented the public here, in the House, for close to 15years: MichelGauthier. Michel, in life, we meet a lot of people, but some of them leave their mark on us forever. From the first time I spoke with you two years ago, I immediately understood that I was talking with a man with heart, a passionate man, a man who had Quebec imprinted on his heart. Because of your decision to join the Conservative Party of Canada, I got to know you personally, and I am most grateful. I will remember all the passion and energy you had in the lead-up to a speech to our supporters. Michel, Canadians, Quebeckers and I will remember you forever, the great man you were, the outstanding speaker, a formidable parliamentarian, with integrity, passion, commitment and love for Quebec. emmanuel dubourg (bourassa, lib.): Mr.Chair, the murder of GeorgeFloyd in Minneapolis resonated strongly within black communities in Canada and also in the heart of Montreal North. At a time of pandemic uncertainty when members of our community find themselves on the front lines as essential workers, an event like this rekindles feelings of fear, powerlessness and injustice. It has happened once again in the UnitedStates, but we are not immune to such behaviour here, in Canada. Dear constituents of Bourassa, I know our stories, I feel with you the pain as a parent and as a black person.  There seems to be some interference when you watch the video conference in the chamber and it's being transmitted, so let us make things run more smoothly. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes in order to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. When the government first starting rolling out programs to help Canadians get through this pandemic, we raised points about some flaws and gaps in the program. Well, Canadians are suffering through both the health and the economic consequences of the lockdown related to the coronavirus. Here we are the first day of June and the government still has yet to address the flaws in its programs; it is still letting so many Canadians down. On April 20 we raised with the Minister of Finance the issue of companies that had purchased another company not being able to demonstrate revenue loss, and therefore not being eligible for the wage subsidy, even though both companies separately would have been able to do just that. I would like to ask the government when it will be fixing this unnecessarily rigid aspect of the wage subsidy program. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr. Chair, I believe that a company with a fantastic Canadian history in the member's riding, Brandt Tractor, which pioneered the manufacturing of augers in Canada, is particularly affected by this. I know that in the case of Brandt Tractor, for example, officials from the Ministry of Finance are directly in touch with the company to work on its issues. It's the same answer we got two weeks before that, and it's the same answer we have been getting from day one. This is a very specific question: Will the government fix this program and allow for companies that have acquired another company to still access the wage subsidy program? hon. Chair, let me just point out that the wage subsidy program is working extremely well for many, many Canadian companies and for many, many Canadians who are able to keep their jobs thanks to the program. Now, for sure there are always going to be companies which, because of specifics in their history, need specific attention, and that the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, reports indicate that up to half of the money allocated for the wage subsidy is going unspent, precisely because this government has left in unnecessarily rigid barriers for companies to be able to access it. It's a yes-or-no question, and the minister still can't answer it. Along the same lines, we asked on April 8 to allow businesses applying for the wage subsidy to demonstrate their 30% revenue loss using other metrics, such as loss of earnings, subscriptions and orders, in order to qualify. Chair, we are very proud of the wage subsidy program and proud of the role it is playing to keep Canadian businesses going and, crucially, to keep Canadian workers connected to their jobs, but I have a question for the member opposite. Half of the questions we hear from the Conservatives in question period are concerns that we're spending too much money, that the deficit is too high. We believe that when times were good, this government should have paid down debt instead of wasting money like $50 million to Mastercard and $12 million to Loblaws. The fact of the matter is that the government left Canadians in a vulnerable position as we were entering this pandemic precisely because of its fiscal irresponsibility, and now they have designed programs that have unnecessary barriers in them that prevent more and more Canadians from getting the help they need. Again, on April 26, Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that don't happen to have a business bank account can qualify. Chair, I'm really grateful for that question because it allows me to set the record straight for Canadians. Canadians need to know that our country has the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. Canada has the fiscal firepower to support Canadians during this unprecedented crisis, and that is what we are going to continue to do. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, the wage subsidy was put in place to support businesses and SMEs, to avoid closures and bankruptcy. Have I missed something? Is the Liberal Party on the verge of bankruptcy? Is it about to shut down? Does the Prime Minister consider that the Liberal Party is getting ready to close its doors? hon. More than 2million Canadians have benefited from this the chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille, you have the floor. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, the Liberal Party made $3million between January and March of this year. I'm wondering why the Liberal Party doesn't use its own money to pay its own employees instead of using the Canada emergency wage subsidy. I would like to point out again that the purpose of the Canada emergency wage subsidy is to support workers across Canada and Quebec, to help them keep their jobs and allow them to stay connected to their workplace. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, does the Deputy Prime Minister think it is moral, fair and honest that employees who have lost their jobs are subsidizing an emergency wage subsidy for the Liberal Party of Canada out of their taxes? hon. There is still a lot to do, but we want to work with all the the chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, many struggling businesses in Quebec don't have access to the Canada emergency wage subsidy because they don't meet the eligibility criteria. Does the Deputy Prime Minister really think it's moral for her party to benefit from the emergency wage subsidy when it has the financial means to pay its own employees? hon. However, it's important to point out that our government has already done a lot to support Canadians. More than eightmillion people are benefiting from the CERB, and more than twomillion the chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille, you have the floor. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, what I understand is not really complicated to understand. I understand that the Liberal Party has money, that it has money to pay its employees, but that it doesn't want to cut the booty it has amassed for the next election. It's as if it were telling us that it's indirectly financing itself for the next election. Will the Deputy Prime Minister show some leadership and convince her own party to give up the emergency wage subsidy and even commit to paying back the money it has already received? hon. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I want to point out that our programs do not discriminate. They are there to help all workers across the country, and I want to point out to what extent our programs do that. Eight million people are currently benefiting from the CERB, and two million are supported by the emergency wage subsidy. Our programs are also helping 380,000students and 639,000businesses the chair: We'll now continue with Mr. Canadians and people across the world are reeling after seeing the images of George Floyd being brutally killed in a callous and casual manner. Anti-black racism also impacts Canada, and people here are feeling the frustration of black lives being neglected and ignored. Will the government commit to tracking race-based data in terms of COVID-19's impact on communities, particularly black Canadians, and track race-based data so that we can have a better response based on the evidence? hon. Chair, I would like to start by thanking the member opposite for his very important question and the very important work he has done throughout his career in drawing attention to racism in Canada and in fighting against it. I agree strongly with the member opposite that we, as Canadians, must be the opposite of complacent. We have to acknowledge that anti-black racism is real in our country, that unconscious bias is real in our country and that systemic discrimination is real. I have more to say about disaggregated data and the coronavirus, and I hope I'll have a chance to do that in my next answer. Will the government commit to working with provinces to ensure there are no such practices allowed to exist in Canada, particularly related to discriminatory police practices like carding? Will the federal government work and use its powers to end those discriminatory practices where federal regulation applies, and work with the provinces to ensure this happens across the country? hon. First of all, on coronavirus, our government believes that disaggregated data, including when it comes to race, is extremely important. We will always work to uphold the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and to ensure the human rights of everyone in Canada are protected. At the federal level, RCMP members are guided by bias-free policing based on equality and non-discrimination. How many times did the Prime Minister's Office and the Liberal government meet with lobbyists from for-profit long-term care homes from March 25 to April 22, during the worst impacts of COVID-19 in long-term care homes? hon. Chair, at this moment I can only speak for myself, and I have not met with any such lobbyists during that period or at other times. While seniors were dying in long-term care homes, the Prime Minister's Office and the Liberal government met with private, for-profit long-term care home lobbyists 12 times. Why did the Prime Minister's Office and the Liberal government choose to meet with these for-profit long-term care home lobbyists instead of meeting with those to solve the problem? Instead of making excuses about the federal government not playing a role, why didn't the Prime Minister and the Liberal government show leadership in calling for an end to profit in long-term care homes? hon. chrystia freeland: Let me very clear about one thing, speaking on behalf of our government and on behalf of the Prime Minister. Our government sees as a matter of utmost concern and utmost urgency what has been happening in long-term care homes in our country, and the reports we have received from the brave men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces about facilities in Ontario and Quebec need to be treated as historic documents that the chair: Now it's Mr.Rayes's turn. alain rayes: Mr.Chair, why is it that employers from industry, businesses and community organizations that have been approved in the Canada summer jobs program still haven't received the money they're entitled to? hon. ahmed hussen (minister of families, children and social development): We are ensuring that the Canada summer jobs program is strengthened and enforced. We have lengthened the time period that the program the chair: Mr.Rayes has the floor. Given the importance of the program for our youth who are looking to work, how is it that the organizations haven't yet received the money they need to hire students? As we know, there have been some problems with the CESB. ahmed hussen: Our government is working hard to help employers adapt to the realities of COVID-19. We recognize the important role that the Canada summer jobs program plays in supporting employers and young workers in communities across the country every year. That is why we have introduced flexibilities in the Canada summer jobs program to hire youth while providing more supports to employers. Last year, there was no crisis and, as of April, all employers who had been admitted to the program had received the money. Right now, community organizations are not receiving the money to which they are entitled to hire students, to put them to work and to give them an employment opportunity. Chair, we have managed to introduce flexibilities to take into consideration the difficult environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the flexibilities we've introduced into the Canada summer jobs program will help with more hiring of youth and more supports to employers, including non-profits and businesses that deliver essential services to Canadians. These changes will help small businesses hire and keep the workers that they need in the Canada summer jobs program. alain rayes: The young people and employers listening to us must be very surprised by what the minister is saying. Right now, there is a $240,000shortfall for about 60student jobs, and the minister has the nerve to tell us that the government has provided more flexibility. Why is the money not available if the government wants to act quickly, to help the economy recover and to help young people? hon. We are listening to the needs of the employers to make sure that this program works not only for them but also for youth, and that it gives them the experiences they need. It is adapted better for the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that youth have the experience they need to gain life and work skills from the program. It's a great program, and we're making it work not just for businesses but also for non-profits. Last week, the owner of a hardware store in a village in my riding had to close his business because he was unable to hire students and had no one to work. This morning, an employer called me to tell me that his request to hire a student had been accepted, but that the delay meant that he could not proceed with the hiring. When is the government going to release the money required for young people to be able to work? hon. Chair, I join the honourable member in recognizing that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic there are some difficulties in terms of structuring the program and making sure that employers are able to access it. That is why we've introduced flexibilities to ensure that employers are able to access the program and that youth are also able to take advantage of the program to gain important work skills, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and especially in providing essential services that serve their fellow Canadians. By its own numbers, PSPC has had to cut the number of N95 masks the government has on order after cancelling contracts with companies that were not able to meet Canadian standards. Will the minister commit to making domestic production of PPE, including N95 masks, a priority? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, our priority is to make sure that we get safe and effective equipment and supplies into the hands of front-line health care workers. We have a contract with Medicom in Montreal for the production of N95 masks and we will continue to work hard to ensure the chair: We'll go back to Ms. Chair, Novo Textiles, a company in my riding, has retooled its factory to produce surgical masks in response to the shortage of PPE in Canada. Additionally, it will soon be producing quality made-in-Canada N95 masks using Canadian designs and Canadian-made machinery. My constituent has invested his own capital and is in active production supplying front-line workers right now, not just talking about it. Is the government serious about growing domestic production capacity, or is it all talk and no action? hon. anita anand: In reality, we have received 101.3 million surgical masks that are being distributed out to provinces and territories. Chair, to make sure Canadian front-line health care workers have exactly what they need to fight this pandemic. Chair, I'm not quite sure what the member is referring to by how many of these, but as I said, we have signed 24 contracts with domestic the chair: We'll have to go back to Ms. Chair, we have surgical masks being produced right here at home, as well as abroad, being brought into Canada the chair: Back to Ms. Chair, as I said, we have a contract with General Motors for the production of surgical masks the chair: Ms. It's been over a month, the I Want To Help platform has no details yet about eligibility, levels of funding, or how to apply. When can students expect to start applying for the CSSG so they can receive their grants? Thank you. Chair, I'm pleased to share that students can anticipate more programs coming out as soon as possible. By visiting Canada.ca/coronavirus, you'll see a suite of programs to ensure that students and young people are able to succeed. The coronavirus will not win, and our government will continue investing in our leaders of today and tomorrow. Last week the President of the Treasury Board wrote a letter to his cabinet colleagues in which he said that, as the federal minister responsible for public access to government information, he has advised his cabinet colleagues of the need for transparency and accountability, even in times of crisis. Does she agree with the President of the Treasury Board's directive? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, the government remains committed to maintaining the openness and transparency of our government during this challenging time. The Government of Canada, along with provincial and territorial governments, have implemented exceptional workplace measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, and to protect the health and safety of federal employees. These measures have had an impact on institutions' abilities to respond to access to information and personal information requests, since most employees are now working from their homes. john brassard: Frankly, I'm surprised that the answer is coming from that minister when the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities is in the House, but I will ask this question. steven guilbeault: Treasury Board Secretariat has provided guidance to institutions to continue to make the best efforts to respond to Access to Information Act and Privacy Act requests and to provide published content the chair: We'll go back to Mr. john brassard: Can the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities tell us who Pierre Lavalle is? the chair: The honourable minister. He was the CEO of the Canada Infrastructure Bank since the beginning, but let's be clear: Crown corporations work at arm's length from the government and must have the chair: We'll return to Mr. john brassard: Can I ask the minister how well she knows her file: 50%, 75% or 100%? hon. What I know is that Canadians want infrastructure built, they want it built across the country, in the member opposite's riding and in ridings across the country. john brassard: How much of the $35 billion of infrastructure money that was allocated to that bank has been spent so far? hon. Duclos' advice to his cabinet colleagues about openness and transparency, I'd like to ask the minister how much Mr. Our government follows the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act when it comes to employee compensation, but remuneration ranges are publicly available. I'd note that this information for the bank's CEOs has been in the public domain the chair: Mr. As I say, the information about salary ranges is publicly available, but personal HR the chair: Mr. Lavalle could have received a bonus after year one of zero to 75% of his base salary, which was $510,000 to $600,000 per year; or in year two, which he was in, zero to 120% of his base salary. catherine mckenna: The rate of any remuneration paid to the chief executive officer is based on the recommendations of the board. Will the government commit to reopening the House of Commons with its full powers, with social distancing, on Monday, September 21? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, as my colleague knows, we're meeting here four days a week, with questions on any topic for an hour and 35 minutes instead of 45 minutes a day. It has no powers to introduce supply day motions, no powers to test government confidence, no powers to do the usual things that Parliament does. At times of crisis, the bedrock principles of rule of law and democracy are tested, and our democratic principles are buckling under the pressure from this government. 6, and in the last election, they rigged the leaders' debates in their favour, and now they have suspended Parliament. Instead of this neutered committee that meets for only a few days with a few members, will the government commit to the full re-opening of this House with all its powers with social distancing on Monday, September 21? hon. pablo rodriguez: Mr.Chair, the government's objective is always to try to resume Parliament as it was before. Today, we have to live with this pandemic, but we will do everything we can to return to a normal situation as quickly as possible. Over the past few weeks, we have sent suggestions to opposition members about the operation of Parliament and they have never responded. Chair, the full parliament with its full powers sat through two world wars, previous pandemics and the October crisis in 1970. It is failing to be strong and clear on Hong Kong and, while the situation today is not that of decades past, it is clear that Canada in the past stood for the rights of people in Hong Kong. There are some 300,000 Canadians living there, and they are looking for the government's support. government has? When will it speak up against the Communist Party of China's United Front workers operating here in this country? When will it do like Australia did in calling for an international investigation of COVID-19, and organize an international coalition of like-minded democracies to defend Hong Kongers and the violation of the Sino-British treaty? the chair: The honourable minister. We all know that the one country, two systemsthe high degree of liberty and freedom enjoyed by the people in Hong Konghas made Hong Kong what it is today, a beacon when it comes to trade and financing. Again, on May 28, with the United States, with the United Kingdom and with Australia, Canada was front and centre in saying that we have deep concerns that the imposition of a national security law by Beijing would undermine the very foundation, the very principles that have made Hong Kong so successful. We said that we and our international partners would look at the implications and the ramifications that this might have on our arrangement. We will be discussing it and will continue to raise our voices to stand up for the people of Hong Kong, and we will do it with our allies. What's the point of having an advance payment program if there's no payment? Can the Minister of Agriculture tell us when these delays will end? the chair: The honourable minister. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): Mr.Chair, I can assure you that we are working with all the independent operators. I can assure you that, under the circumstances, they are doing their best to make the advance payments mr. However, did the minister approve a policy change on April 1 that made the eligibility for these loans more difficult during the middle of a pandemic, yes or no? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, a number of changes and improvements have been made to the program. To make things easier for our administrators, we have postponed some of the changes that could have been problematic. Who advised her that it would be a good idea to make it more difficult for the farmers to access the advance payment program in the middle of a pandemic? Or did she just go ahead and do this on her own? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, we are constantly working with the administrators of the program. We are fully prepared to respond to their requests so that the advance payments program can best serve our producers across the country. larry maguire: Livestock producers are telling me that the premiums for the western livestock insurance program are too high. I told the Minister of Agriculture over two weeks ago that this was a problem, and yet she went out and said that farmers needed to make better use of existing support. When will the Minister of Agriculture listen to what the farmers are saying so they can actually use the existing programs? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, I would like to remind everyone that we have put in place certain measures to improve access to AgriStability. It is now $100million for pork and beef producers alone, not counting the $77.5million for food processors. larry maguire: Livestock producers in my riding and several across Canada are still waiting for the Minister of Agriculture's promise for an AgriRecovery program. When will the Minister of Agriculture stop rubbing salt in the farmers' wounds and provide the rest of the story she has been saying is on its way for over a month now in her AgriRecovery promise? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, we have committed $50million to beef producers and $50million to pork producers through the AgriRecovery program. Here is how the program works: the federal government contributes up to60% and then the provinces implement it how they see fit. larry maguire: The funding announced by the Minister of Agriculture for the livestock industry was insufficient, and what was promised has not been delivered. This has caused hogs to be euthanized and over 100,000 feeder cattle to become overweight. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, once again, we have significantly increased the amounts available through AgriRecovery. dominic leblanc: Mr.Chair, we know that not everyone experiences economic recovery in the same way. In some sectors, such as tourism, fishery, hotels and restaurants, we do not know when activity will resume or whether it will resume slowly. Given that the CERB lasts 16weeks, they are all afraid that they will be left with nothing. Chair, we moved very quickly at the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to support workersthose who have lost their jobs, who were laid off, or those whose jobs simply disappearedthrough the Canada emergency response benefit. Chair, the workers that the honourable member identified, including those who were not eligible for the EI, were also covered by the Canada emergency response benefit. We recognized the urgency of the situation, which is why we took action to support workers and their families through the Canada emergency response benefit. louise chabot: Mr.Chair, are we going to continue to help workers in these difficult times? The answer is simple. Can you do anything about it? Can I walk out of the House today and tell all those people that the CERB is going to be extended? hon. bill morneau (minister of finance): Mr.Chair, I would like to thank the honourable member for her question. Of course, we are looking at how we can gradually reopen our economy by continuing to help people to be in a good position. People are afraid to go back to full-time jobs because they are afraid of losing all their emergency benefits. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, we know that, with a responsible reopening of the economy, we have to look at our programs to make sure that we are keeping and protecting people. the chair: We are going to take a break so that our employees can change shifts without jeopardizing their health. While we have a few seconds, I would also like to remind members to address their questions to the chair, not directly to the ministers. Today, June 1, under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization, we celebrate World Milk Day. World Milk Day allows us to emphasize the importance of milk as a global food, its benefits for our health as well as our nutrition; and to celebrate the dairy sector, from the primary producers to the processors who ensure that our many high-quality dairy products get to the marketplace. Canadians are fortunate to have a thriving dairy sector that, under supply management, provides high-quality products at reasonable prices to consumers. Even under supply management though, dairy farmers have found themselves facing difficult challenges as a result of recent trade agreements and sudden market shocks as a result of the pandemic. Chair, to acknowledge World Milk Day, I'd love to be able to raise a glass of wholesome white or chocolate milk, but we can't do that. On the other hand, I must ask the Minister of Agriculture what the government is doing to support the dairy sector in these times so we can celebrate World Milk Day next year with more vim and vigour. Today it is particularly important to thank families working on the 11,000 dairy farms across the country, caring for 1.4 million cows to produce each year more than 9.3 billion litres of milk of the highest quality. The dairy sector in Canada is made up of more than 220,000 Canadians and foreign workers who dedicate their lives to feed us. While our society lives through unprecedented changes, the dairy sector demonstrates its resilience and proves more than ever the value of the supply management system. It is why we increased by $200 million the borrowing capacity of the Canadian Dairy Commission to improve its butter and cheese storage programs, giving the flexibility to manage the surplus of milk and support its mandate. Over the past few years, we have invested in dairy farms and given direct compensation to dairy farmers through trade agreements with Europe and Asia. Chair, last week a horrific video surfaced showing the killing of an unarmed black man at the hands of the Minneapolis police. George Floyd's death was the latest in a series of unwarranted deaths of black men and women at the hands of police. Since his death, solidarity protests have erupted across cities in the United States and all over the world asking for justice and a stop to systemic dehumanization of black people. I wish I could say we are, but sadly we are not immune to the reality of what is happening south of the border. The same protests taking place in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris and London are also taking place in our own backyard. In cities like Montreal and Toronto, thousands of people have already taken to the streets, not only to decry anti-black racism but also to ask for tangible solutions to effectively combat anti-black racism. We don't have to wait for pain, suffering and outrage to boil to the surface to act. As Canadians are demonstrating and calling on their society and governments to do better, can the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth tell us what this government is doing to address anti-black racism in Canada and to ensure we are evening the playing field for black Canadians? the acting chair (mr. If we as Canadians truly desire an inclusive Canada, every single one of us must step up, be an ally and do what we can to make workplaces, communities and public spaces safer. The open, transparent, merit-based appointment process is resulting in decision-making tables better reflecting Canadians. We recognize the UN International Decade for People of African Descent; the applications for capacity building in black Canadian communities are being assessed; the anti-racism secretariat is set up for Canadians but also for government departments to improve their systems, including advancement opportunities; and the recently announced immunity task force will provide disaggregated data to decision-makers because decisions need to be based on science and evidence. Although our government is moving in the right decision, there is clearly a lot more work to do and we are committed to doing that work with communities as allies, as partners. Chair, workers' unions, business leaders and analysts across the country are raising a huge alarm over potential bankruptcies due to COVID-19. For years the government has promised to change the laws to protect workers from corporate bankruptcy, but has failed to deliver. Will this government fix the law before more Canadian workers lose their hard-earned pensions? the acting chair (mr. I'd like to thank the member for Hamilton Mountain for that question and for his advocacy on this file. I remind the member that since 2015 one of our first initiatives was the repealing of Bills C-525 and C-377, which were anti-union legislation. Chair, the changes the government made last year to bankruptcy insolvency laws were largely cosmetic and won't protect workers' and pensioners' livelihoods once bankruptcy hits. The government can protect severance, termination pay, pensions and benefits from corporate theft, but will they do it, yes or no? the acting chair (mr. Chair, we made a number of significant changes in budget 2019, including that the process for the CCAA be more open and transparent. One thing we heard in the consultations was the ability for courts to set aside executive bonuses, and we implemented all those changes because we want to continue to protect pensioners. Will the government fix the lawsyes or noto protect workers' and pensioners' rights? the acting chair (mr. daniel blaikie (elmwoodtranscona, ndp): Thank you very much, Mr. Twice, following negotiations with the NDP, the government has committed to provide direct financial assistance to people living with disabilities. I have a lot of sympathy for people across the country who are living with disabilities and are getting impatient with the fact that alongside its initial commitment to seniors, for instance, the government made a commitment to helping people living with disabilities with the same kind of direct financial assistance, and it hasn't come. Why has it taken so long for the government to get around to helping people who are in a crisis right now? I want to know the reason why this hasn't been announced yet. We're moving forward with the Canada emergency student benefit, which will provide $2,000 per month for eligible students with permanent disabilities. We have done a lot, but we will continue to do more, and we will have more to share on our continuing efforts to support persons with disabilities. Their commitment was for direct financial assistance to people living with disabilities who are facing additional costs because of the pandemic. When are they going to get around to it? Why should people living with disabilities have to wait any longer than they already have? the acting chair (mr. Chair, that is precisely why we are listening closely to the COVID-19 disability advisory group to get expert advice. According to La Presse, federal cabinet ministers Steven Guilbeault , Catherine McKenna and Jonathan Wilkinson have been handed responsibility for crafting an economic recovery plan that aims to accelerate the green shift. True to form, this cabal around the Prime Minister has declared let's not let a good crisis go to waste. Can the Prime Minister confirm that his ministers have been working with environmental lobby groups for further financial support to engineer Canada's economy post COVID? the acting chair (mr. As we support Canadians through this time, we will also ensure our long-term economic, environmental and physical well-being. Our government remains committed to building a stronger and more resilient economy to ensure a sustainable, prosperous future for our kids and grandkids. Just like science is guiding us in our response to COVID-19, science will continue to guide us toward reduced pollution and in fighting climate change. greg mclean: The task force for a resilient recovery was quoted as saying last week that they would have recommendations for government action available within eight weeks, notably eight weeks when Parliament is, by this government's design, absent. Can the Prime Minister disclose to this committee how many meetings his 61 environmental activist advisers have had with the task force or its members? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, our most urgent priority with respect to COVID-19 is the health and safety of Canadians. While supporting Canadians during this period, we must also ensure our economic, environmental and physical well-being in the long term. Our government remains committed to building a stronger, more resilient economy to ensure a sustainable future for our grandchildren and children. greg mclean: The task force is a who's who of academics and bureaucrats, but surprisingly, includes no one from the productive part of the Canadian economy. The task force is reviewing work produced by Smart Prosperity, a government-funded institute whose membership overlaps with both the task force and the government's own Canadian Institute for Climate Choices. How many organizations does this government need to fund to recycle work produced by other redundant government-funded entities? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, as we know, our priority right now is the health and safety of Canadians. Just as science guides us in our response to COVID-19, it will continue to guide us in reducing pollution and fighting climate change. Our priority is to support Canadians during this period and we must also ensure our environmental, economic and physical well-being in the long term. Perhaps it's just a coincidence, but can the Prime Minister confirm if this is the same Gerald Butts who was forced to resign as his principal secretary for his role in attempting to force Canada's then justice minister into breaking the law? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, since the beginning of this crisis, our priority has been to support Canadians and their health and safety. We will continue to do so, because it is important that we get through this crisis by supporting Canadians. mona fortier: Once again, Mr.Chair, it is important to talk to Canadians right now to tell them that we are putting their health and safety first. Chair, is this the same Gerald Butts who, in his role as the principal secretary in the office of Ontario's then premier, advanced policies that now saddle Ontarians with the highest energy costs in North America? Is this is the same Gerald Butts who weighed down Ontario with the world's highest subnational debt burden, all for the benefit of new green jobs that, notably, have never arrived? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, as we know, for the past two and a half months, we have been supporting Canadians. chris d'entremont: Yesterday, the Minister responsible for tourism, ACOA and official languages was happy to close our national Tourism Week by announcing investments of $70 million to offset financial losses in the tourism industry across Canada. Southern Ontario received $30 million, northern Ontario received $7 million and western Canada received $3.5 million. Knowing that we just had an announcement from the Minister of Transport that there will be no cruise ships in Atlantic Canada or anywhere in Canada this year, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, where is the program for Atlantic Canada? hon. I know he's a very strong advocate for the tourism sector in Atlantic Canada, so I want to reassure him. Rather than doing marketing internationally, we will be supporting destination marketing organizations across the country, including in Atlantic Canada, to make sure that we launch this new movement to visit local. chris d'entremont: That would be all great if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic and you can't even cross the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick border without having to self-isolate for two weeks. In Saint John, New Brunswick, 79 cruise ships and more than 270,000 passengers will not be giving back to that local community. Prince Edward Island, which was expected to have a record attendance year, will lose visits of 97 ships and 154,000 passengers, and $60 million to the province's economy will be lost. Chair, my question to the minister is this: Who is ACOA going to be working with, and what kinds of programs are going to be available to help them through this very difficult year? hon. It is a bit like the canary in the coal mine; it was the first impacted, and definitely it is still impacted. Again, recently I had good conversations with the chambers of commerce all across Atlantic Canada, including Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador for the tourism sector. They wanted to have access to it until later in the summer, and it has been extended to the end of August. chris d'entremont: Mr.Chair, like the minister, last week, I spoke with Simon-Pierre Poulin, the director of Le Franco newspaper in Alberta, about the Sauvons Saint-Jean movement. He asked me why we could not continue to work on official languages and on modernizing the act even though Parliament is sitting in a different configuration. Unfortunately, I had to explain to him that many restrictions were associated with the current format of this fake Parliament. The Liberal government made a commitment to modernize the Official Languages Act in the first six months of its mandate. mlanie joly: Mr.Chair, it goes without saying that our two official languages are important and that, when it comes to language rights, we must always be on guard and protect what we have achieved. I had the opportunity to speak with my two counterparts in Alberta late Friday afternoon to tell them about our concerns and the need to protect the institution from drastic cuts. richard martel (chicoutimile fjord, cpc): Mr.Chair, some people for whom the 15weeks of sickness benefits were not enough before the COVID-19crisis now have to exhaust their regular employment insurance benefits before they are entitled to the CERB. Today, I would like to know whether they will be able to exhaust their weeks of eligibility for the CERB after October3. Chair, we ensured that those who switched over to the Canada emergency response benefit would be covered by it, whether they were EI eligible or not. We are committed to supporting all of the workers who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. richard martel: According to a survey conducted by the Universit du Qubec Trois-Rivires' research institute on small and medium size businesses, the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region would be the most affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. In fact, in our region, the tourism industry generates more than $300million in economic activity, including $58million for the cruise industry alone. mlanie joly: Mr.Chair, it goes without saying that the tourism industry is indeed very much affected. We are also providing the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance, as well as the $40,000loans from the Canada emergency business account. I am having good talks with various stakeholders in Quebec, including Martin Soucy from the Alliance de l'industrie touristique du Qubec. richard martel: Mr.Chair, the tourism industry in the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region is the sum of all its stakeholders. Overly restrictive standards will prevent some tourist accommodation from welcoming guests this year, even though they will have to pay their bills every month. We really want to be able to reach these small businesses, of which there are many in SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec and across the country. That is why the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have committed an additional $1billion to help those businesses that fall through the cracks. We need to respond now, and I will have more to say about it in the next few days. richard martel: Mr.Chair, I was very disappointed to see that we had lost asparagus crops due to a labour shortage. When I spoke with the blueberry growers in my area, they told me they were concerned that the same thing could happen to them. Chair, we believe that the flexibilities we have introduced to the Canada summer jobs program will enable more employers to use it, including more businesses, as well as help young people to acquire the necessary skills and benefits from this really important program. richard martel: Mr.Chair, on May19, the government said that it was studying several solutions to help business owners and entrepreneurs who operate their business using a personal bank account. Chair, small businesses are the heart of all of our communities, and we've been working really hard to help them. On Tuesday, May 26, she gained a new resident when Brinnley Lisette Huby was born to parents Adam and Carina Huby. Carina is my daughter, and that makes Brinnley my first grandchild and presently my favourite newest Canadian. Dave Epp: Minister Jordan, the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation is allowed access to the seafood stabilization fund, while you deny its competitor, our Ontario fisheries that fish on the Great Lakes, the similar right to apply. The Ontario inland fishers and the people in Ontario are eligible for other programs that are offered through the regional development agencies. We're making sure that we're addressing the concerns of inland fisheries as well as coastal fisheries. dave epp: Minister, will you then direct these regional agencies to provide equitable funding equivalent to the seafood stabilization fund? hon. Chair, we're making sure that they have the same access to programs through the regional development agencies as there is through the seafood stabilization fund. We're making sure that everyone who is in need of support through the programs will be able to access it. dave epp: According to Stats Canada, before my granddaughter turns one year old, her share of the federal debt will be over $39,000. What is Minister Morneau's fiscal plan for Canada so that the interest on this debt doesn't cripple Canada with higher taxes? hon. In that way we can have jobs and we can get through this pandemic and have a strong economy and be able to continue with our approach to managing our economy in a responsible the acting chair (mr. dave epp: Minister, when can Parliament, or this semblance of it, see that plan for economic prosperity? the acting chair (mr. We've been quite clear that we need to be transparent on a daily basis by giving Canadians an understanding of the investments that we're making through this pandemic. Chair, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said three months before the pandemic that this current government's level of spending and incurring of debt is untenable and that future generations, like my granddaughter, will have to pay for it. Chair, coming into this pandemic in a strong fiscal position with the lowest amount of debt among the G7 countries is a function of our economy that's afforded us the opportunity to invest on behalf of Canadians. dave epp: What is the budget for stopping illegal American guns from getting through our borders? hon. I can tell you that we have invested considerable amounts of money and have earmarked ongoing monies to ensure that we address the issue of illegal guns passing across the border. dave epp: What's the budget, then, to fight government-trained and licensed Canadians in the court challenge that's now been triggered? the acting chair (mr. dave epp: What is the budget for fighting the government-trained and licensed people who are now triggering a lawsuit against your order in council? hon. Chair, I don't have the answer to that question, but obviously the government will defend its position. Chair, COVID-19 has exacerbated the problem of this government's policy of spending the cupboards bare in good times instead of planning for a rainy dayand folks, we're in a storm. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities says they need $10 billion in targeted emergency operating funding, so do municipalities slash services, do they raise taxes, or will we be there for the municipalities? hon. chrystia freeland: Our government absolutely understands the crucial role municipalities play as the engine of our economy at all times, and particularly today, as in many parts of the country we are looking to restart the economy. That is why the Prime Minister announced just this morning that we will be accelerating payments under the gas tax fund. Many did their best to keep employees engaged and tried hard to not lose clients, as the government urged them to do. Thousands of business owners across the country will not be able to pay their rent today and risk closing permanently. Will the government push the provinces to include an eviction moratorium during the pandemic and make this commercial rent assistance program more flexible to ensure small businesses can survive? hon. Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for the question, which recognizes the very serious challenge that many small businesses are facing during the course of this pandemic. We know that the programs we've put forward, programs like the emergency business account, are supporting businesses, but the emergency rent approach, on which we've worked together with provinces, can also help significantly. Of course, the suggestion from the member that provinces take action in restricting evictions is one that I've been speaking about to ministers of finance from the provinces over the course of the last couple of months. Chair, this week marks the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and we are currently seeing repression of the democracy movement in Hong Kong. In spite of this knowledge, the Harper Conservative government signed a lopsided and anti-democratic investment treaty with China in 2012, the Canada-China FIPA. This Conservative deal gave Chinese state-owned corporations extraordinary powers to challenge our democratic decisions through a secretive private tribunal system. In the years since the FIPA was signed, with no vote in Parliament, Chinese state-owned corporations have been purchasing Canadian assets and resources. These corporations can seek financial compensation from Canadian taxpayers for the loss of potential profit when our laws and policies get in the way of their profit-taking. Can the government tell us whether any of these Chinese corporations has threatened to use the anti-democratic investor-state provisions of the FIPA to seek financial compensation from Canadian taxpayers? hon. franois-philippe champagne: As I'm sure the member will know, Canada is setting up with its allies around the world to protect the freedom and democracy that has been enjoyed by the people in Hong Kong. As he knows, we have issued a declaration with a number of allies we have called upon to make sure that measures remain in place to protect the freedom and liberty of the people of Hong Kong. We know that the one country, two systems treaty system has provided the framework under which the people of Hong Kong have been able to create an economy that is resilient and has made Hong Kong a place where people want to do business, commerce and trade. I would refer the member to the joint statement we have issued with the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. We have spoken with one voice and we have said we have deep concerns that the actions by Beijing, if they were to proceed with this national security law unilaterally, would undermine the bedrock of what has made Hong Kong, and that we will review the impact that the acting chair (mr. paul manly: That was a trick question, because this anti-democratic agreement states that we wouldn't be able to have permission to disclose that information if there was, in fact, an investor-state dispute. Unlike NAFTA, which had a six-month period for renegotiation, the Harper Conservatives locked us into a 15-year agreement with the FIPA and this anti-democratic agreement. Will the government re-engage the special committee on Canada-China relations so we can do a thorough investigation of this Conservative sellout of Canadian democracy the acting chair (mr. Canada will always pursue trade in the interest of Canadians, and we are in the process of reviewing our FIPA agreements so those agreements can provide the right framework for Canadians to trade, with the interests of Canadians always top of mind. Will the government work with the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation and inland fishers to develop and facilitate the delivery of an emergency package that works for them and find ways to redirect product to domestic markets, including communities facing food insecurity now? hon. Chair, we've recognized how hard the pandemic has hit our fishers and our fishing sector. One of the things we're doing primarily is the harvesters' benefit, which allows all harvesters to take advantage of a benefit as well as a grant contribution to help them get through. We're also changing EI so they can now qualify for their EI benefits based on previous seasons, not this one, recognizing they're going to face challenges this year. We are continuing to look at ways we can address the challenges within the industry and we'll continue to work with them to make sure we are addressing those needs. This government has sat by while the Canadian Transportation Agency issued a statement to back up the airlines' appalling actions. What is this government doing to fix this? Why aren't they ensuring that public funds involve reimbursing passengers and an equity stake for Canadians? hon. Chair, I certainly recognize the very difficult situation and the frustration of Canadians who would have preferred a refund. At the same time, at this point if airlines were required to immediately reimburse all the cancelled tickets, it would have a devastating effect on the airlines. That is why the Canadian Transportation Agency, which is an independent body, recommended that vouchers be issued and that they have a reasonable time to be usedtwo years. It is also very important to bear in mind that as we begin to exit this pandemic, we must still have an airline industry in this country. Chair, in Victoria housing and homelessness were at a crisis point long before the pandemic hit, but now people are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. If you don't have a place to live, you don't have the luxury of following public health advice and staying home. As part of the recovery, will this government be increasing funding to build or buy the housing needed to address homelessness? hon. Chair, very early in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our government provided $157.5 million directly to 51 community entities to respond directly to the needs of homeless Canadians. While the province has stepped up, it cost them $18.5 million to purchase just one hotel in Victoria. The $157.5 million, I must note, was additional money on top of the base funding that we provide every year to address the needs of Canada's most vulnerable. We are trusting the community entities to make the decisions on where the funding goes and to respond in a way that meets the the acting chair (mr. This government's national housing strategy reduces the level of targeted funding for lower-income households, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer. My question is simple: Coming out of the pandemic in the coming months, is the government going to increase housing funding to address the immediate need, yes or no? hon. Regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic, the last time I checked, we still had a democratic system and the government had to remain accountable. Does the government intend to extend the measures over the summer? If so, how will it do so? The government must also present its working scenarios for the economic recovery. Every day, we announce measures, of course, but also the cost of the measures and the amount of the investments. gabriel ste-marie: In my opinion, Mr.Chair, it will really be too late to do the economic update when things are more stable. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, let me confirm that we will continue to be transparent about the investments; it is very important. As I said, when the situation is a little more stable, we will have the opportunity to explain our situation with an economic update. gabriel ste-marie: Once again, Mr.Chair, when the situation is more stable, it will be too late to do an economic update; instead we will have to table a budget with the recovery in mind. Speaking of the recovery, the Parliamentary Budget Officer is surprised that the government is calling on the private sector for ideas for its recovery plan. Mr.Giroux points out that this government has thousands of public servants with very good ideas, and he adds that the government can also ask for the opposition parties' views. member that it is important to listen to what we are trying to do, and to listen to people's ideas and opinions, not only in Parliament, but also from our society. Of course, with our approach, we will address the economic recovery in a way that will ensure we can maintain our very strong position. gabriel ste-marie: Mr.Chair, we are still surprised that the government has contracted out its recovery plan to the private sector. It would help them to loosen the purse strings and be assured that there will be economic life after the pandemic. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, we feel it is very important to consider what we need to do in each phase of our recovery. At this time, it is necessary to consider the public health situation and the gradual reopening of our economy. Obviously, by gathering more information in Phase3, we will be able to consider more than one approach to recovery. I understand that the exact date for tabling the recovery plan may be difficult to determine at this time. Can the minister tell us whether he currently intends to table the recovery plan in a month ending in ber? If not, will it be before or after that? hon. bill morneau: We continue to work with the provinces on an approach to determine the timing of the recovery, and we are also listening to our colleagues in Parliament, of course. We were shocked to hear that his own Minister of Digital Government used WeChat, a Chinese social media site, to raise funds to sue a Global News reporterfor what? It was for daring to expose China's attempt to hoard PPE during the COVID crisis. Is it the practice of the government to support lawsuits against Canadian reporters who challenge the hostile actions of the regime in China, and will the Prime Minister now condemn the actions of the digital government minister? hon. As many members on all sides of the House know, WeChat is a social media platform used to engage and share information with the Chinese-Canadian community. In this case, the individual who violated the guidelines of the group is no longer a part of that group. Chair, Canadians have no reason to trust the Prime Minister on anything to do with China, especially when it comes to trade policy. Two and a half years ago, the Prime Minister travelled to China to commence free trade negotiations, and the talks ended up in complete failure and embarrassment. Still the Prime Minister continues to cozy up to the Chinese regime, refusing to ban Huawei from our 5G network or to speak out convincingly against China's oppression in Hong Kong. Can the minister tell us whether at any time during the last six months the Prime Minister or anyone else in his government has had discussions with China about a free trade agreement? A simple yes or no will do. Any work that we do on trade and on all matters will always be in the interests of Canadians first. ed fast: I think Canadians will see that the minister didn't even answer a simple yes-or-no question, so I'll ask her a simpler yes-or-no question. Is she or anyone else in her government presently discussing or negotiating a free trade agreement with China, yes or no? hon. Chair, we will always do our work, including any discussions on trade and indeed all of our work, with the interests of Canadians and Canadian businesses as our absolute top priority. Will the minister now assure Canadians that she and the Prime Minister's government will not negotiate a free trade agreement with China, yes or no? hon. mary ng: Any work that we do will always be guided by the best interests of Canadians and Canadian businesses. Will the minister tell us why she thinks negotiating a trade agreement with a hostile country like China is in Canada's best interests? hon. Free trade is a good thing when it takes place between like-minded countries that embrace free market principles and apply the rule of law. In fact, China repeatedly flouts international trade rules, illegally dumps underpriced goods into Canada, and prevents Canadian canola, beef and pork from entering China. Will the minister now assure us that our government will not negotiate any free trade agreements with China, yes or no? hon. mary ng: We are not in discussions with China on a free trade agreement, and as my colleagues, including the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, have said many times in this House and outside of this House, our priority continues to be the immediate release of Canadians detained in China. bruce stanton): This will conclude today's sitting of the special committee on the COVID-19 pandemic<doc-sep>lynne neagle am: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's meeting of the\u00a0Children, Young People and Education\u00a0Committee. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? darren millar am: Yes, I have a declaration of interest, Chair. I understand that my daughter features in one of the videos that is going to be used to contribute evidence to this inquiry. And, in addition, I'm a governor of one of the schools that features in the video. So, item 2, then, today is our first session on the provision of textbooks and learning resources for pupils, which is a video of interviews with young people and teachers. The committee team has been out to take video evidence around Wales, and we're now going to watch the results of that on the screen. Well, I'm sure that the committee\u00a0would want me to place on record our thanks to the young people and the teachers who took part in that very helpful and informative video. We'll move on now then to our evidence session, and I'm very pleased to welcome Gareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC,\u00a0Mike Ebbsworth, assistant director educational support, WJEC,\u00a0Philip Blaker, chief executive of Qualifications Wales, and\u00a0Emyr George, associate director general qualifications\u00a0at Qualifications Wales. So, thank you all of you for attending and thank you for the papers that you provided in advance as well. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions now, and if I can just start by asking you to outline what you see as your role in ensuring that students and teachers in Wales have the resources that they need to pass general qualifications and what you think the role of commercial publishers and Welsh Government is. philip blaker: Shall I start? So, Qualifications Wales is the regulator of the awarding bodies, so we regulate awarding bodies. In regulating the awarding body, our primary focus is also on the design of the qualifications and then the delivery of the assessment. That said, when we are going through the design of the qualifications, we go through an approval process, so we develop approval criteria and we ask WJEC\u00a0to submit their specifications against those approval criteria and sample assessment materials as well. So, our focus is very much on making sure that teachers are able, through the sample assessment materials and the specifications, to have a good understanding of what is going to be expected of them in the examinations and of their pupils in the examinations. So, that's setting out the knowledge, skills and understandings\u00a0that will be assessed by WJEC\u00a0when those exams are sat. So, during the last round of approvals, we pulled together interested parties in Welsh Government, regional consortia and WJEC\u00a0to look at resources that would be available with a view to facilitating the discussion about who would be best placed to fill the gaps where there may be perceived to be gaps in resources. Our other primary role is in maintaining standards.\u00a0So, as the regulator of qualifications, what we want to do is we want to make that the awards of qualifications\u2014so, the grades that people get\u2014are fair.\u00a0One of the things we do is set out the way in which the awarding bodies will set grades\u2014so, the awarding process, the methods that will be used\u2014and then we monitor WJEC's\u00a0award of grades against those processes. During a period of change, we prescribe the use of comparable outcomes as the primary approach, largely because comparable outcomes are designed for circumstances like this, where there's a change in a specification particularly, because there are any number of reasons, including resources, why performance may be different from one year to the next, but comparable outcomes is there to ensure that, all things being equal, if the cohorts have the same ability, the same grade should be awarded from one year to the next. Much of that has been related to the timelines that we've all had to deliver new specifications against, which have been far from ideal for everybody involved. We think that particularly our role moving forward will be looking at the timelines for reforms\u00a0that will be necessary for the new curriculum to make sure that this situation isn't repeated and that there is sufficient time in future reforms to allow for greater system readiness. In terms of the roles of others, Welsh Government have a role at the moment in terms of grant funding of translation of materials into Welsh medium. And there is, through the common model at the moment\u2014and this is a model that is common between England and Wales\u2014a reliance on commercial publishers to provide textbooks. Now, that's something that probably needs to be looked at in the future in terms of potential\u00a0different models for how that might be achieved and also, potentially, around a paradigm shift in what's expected of those materials. The WJEC does provide what's required in a regulatory sense, and there are two things there\u2014the specification, which tends to be very comprehensive in providing guidance in terms of drawing up a programme of teaching, and also exemplar assessments, which include marking, and those go to the regulator before they are published. The WJEC also do invest a great deal in resources that we produce digitally in both languages simultaneously. Each new course has substantial teaching guidance, which includes a great deal of useful information for teachers and pupils. And we run a professional development programme for teachers that is free of charge when courses are new, and then annually there is some charge for those events. Indeed, the regulations as they stand in Wales, Northern Ireland and England preclude examination bodies from having commercial links with providers of textbooks, but that is something that emerges from the three-nation regime that existed in terms of qualifications. So, that is one point that we noted as something that needs to be considered for Wales as we move forward, whether it would be possible\u2014. As\u00a0we are not talking about examination boards competing with each other in Wales for GCSE and A-levels, in passing, that is something that I would want to suggest may deserve review. At the moment, these tend to be England-based\u2014Hodder Education and Illuminate Education, for example\u2014and then the Welsh Government does provide funding to the WJEC to support the process of providing Welsh-language versions for those textbooks. So, we use that funding to provide editorial support to the process, and also to pay for translation costs, and we give significant guidance in terms of terminology. We have a language services team including excellent editors and translators within the WJEC, and we work closely with external translators too, and we use translation technology increasingly, which facilitates a great many things. Beyond that, I think the WJEC does see the need for flexibility, particularly when difficulties arise, and you heard there of some of the methods used by Mike and others to get digital resources available earlier than the print versions. And I should also note perhaps that, as the WJEC is very much involved with stakeholders, we feel that we do have a contribution to make in terms of ideas for the future. What is your view on that as a good use of teachers' time in Wales? gareth pierce: I think the question of translation is an interesting one. I think perhaps we need to understand what causes the need for that because, as I mentioned earlier, there are so many resources available digitally in both languages at the same time. Perhaps an interesting question is: is that source useful for teachers, being able to draw resources from two sources? Another interesting question, I think, is\u2014. The Welsh language, of course, is a language that is used in an educational context, but we are in a big world that's an English language world. I'm very aware that many of the websites we refer to in our resources and many of the case studies, as was mentioned in that video\u2014they are available\u00a0in English only.\u00a0Therefore, I think another interesting question is: can we discover what those additional resources are that are worth translating? And, certainly, it would be very unfortunate\u00a0if there were a dozen Welsh-medium schools, for example, translating material from the same website independently of each other. If there are a few websites, or a few case studies, in this big external\u00a0digital world that are worth translating, shouldn't we able to source those early? Because I don't think it's a good use of teachers' time. What is the vision in terms of teaching in a Welsh-medium class, in particular, perhaps, in the\u00a0A-level classes? I'm sure that some teachers feel that there is a way\u00a0of enriching\u00a0the\u00a0teaching by referring to terms in both languages, as well as explaining those terms in their own language. But the impression I got from the video was that there was quite a lot of mechanical translating happening, and\u00a0perhaps there is a need to understand more of the context. llyr gruffydd am: Just to pick up on your point on the additional\u00a0materials, whose role would it be to asses\u00a0this or to take that overview, and then to respond to the demand? gareth pierce: Mike, in the WJEC, has conversations about resources in the team he's part of. That is extremely important\u2014to identify, as Gareth has just said, those materials that need to be translated, and not everything\u00a0needs to. We've made a lot of use recently of speaking with teachers and\u00a0the consortia, and ensuring\u00a0then that we are focusing on those things that need that attention. llyr gruffydd am: But would you\u2014? The question I'm asking is: would you still see that as a core part of your work, although\u00a0it's not necessarily essential in terms of the provision that you're required to provide? gareth pierce: Yes, we invest substantially from the WJEC budget into digital resources. So, through the types of conversations\u00a0that Mike mentioned, in terms of identifying needs, deciding on priorities with\u00a0teachers in individual subject areas, that can provide very useful\u00a0information\u00a0for us in terms of prioritisation. llyr gruffydd am: And do we need further resources for that? gareth pierce: Well, it's an interesting\u00a0question. The WJEC is doing as much as we can\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Why isn't it happening to the extent that it needs to happen, then? gareth pierce: One can always do more, of course. The WJEC is trying to use its budget prudently, and most of our funding comes from payments made by schools and\u00a0colleges in terms of taking assessments. So, we do need to make choices within the substantial budget we have in terms of the work that Mike is undertaking. mike ebbsworth: There is a need to be careful as well in identifying resources and needs, and that those are suited towards the requirements. Quite often a teacher\u2014and I've been a teacher myself\u2014has this idea that there is a need to have everything. There has been a move towards different means of assessment over recent years, and we've moved our resources towards that to meet the needs of teachers on how to undertake\u00a0that sort of assessment. lynne neagle am: Did you want to come in on any of this? philip blaker: I'm just going to say one thing. Teachers will want to be creative in the use of resources, and, in doing that, they'll potentially want to adapt resources from either language. I think one of the things that we would be quite keen to try and establish moving forward is what is the common core that should by default be available bilingually, and then what sits around that that would be for schools to use creatively and adapt. And what I wouldn't want to see is a default\u00a0position where all materials were bilingual\u2014a wide range of resources that might be created from all sorts of diverse, different channels\u2014because\u00a0that may inhibit the creation of some of those materials that may be more creative, which could then be used by teachers as they see appropriate. But I think it is reasonable to\u00a0expect for that core, common body\u00a0of knowledge\u00a0to be available bilingually by default, and for teachers not to have to spend time translating that. The \u00a3500,000 funding for Welsh-medium educational resource that's in the budget for 2018-19\u2014are you able to share any information\u00a0with the committee as to how that's going to be spent? gareth pierce: Tthe WJEC has some information in terms of that budget. It is a Welsh Government budget, and they have annual discussions with us as to what resources we are likely to be working on along with publishers, and where we would like to make a claim against that grant to pay for the editorial and translation costs that we will have incurred. Now, there have been conversations recently about possible support from that grant for some research work into the use of various materials and resources, and also, although this would be a very small part, a contribution towards seminars for publishers. But that isn't a full picture of the \u00a3500,000; I think you would have to ask the Welsh Government about the exact allocation of that total fund. We've just started this financial year; I'm sure there is some flexibility in their thinking in terms of the use of some of this resource. We have contributed a list of publications, for example, that are ongoing, and they're aware of that, and a percentage of that funding then will go towards ensuring that those are there through the medium of Welsh. darren millar am: This is a huge mess, isn't it? It's a huge mess, which is causing lots of pressure and extra work for teachers, lots of pressure and extra work for learners, and is affecting the well-being of students, at a time when they need to be mentally fit, in order to go through the general stress that learners face when they have exams coming up. We know that the problems are not confined to Welsh-medium resources; they're also being experienced in English language resources as well, particularly in terms of the availability of textbooks. You've both mentioned\u2014both of your organisations have mentioned that there needs to be some sort of common core of resources available for learners and teachers, and I would agree with you on that front. But isn't a textbook a pretty basic element of anybody's toolkit for supporting a child getting through the information that they need to learn, and swot up on, in advance of exams? gareth pierce: I think that the evidence is that different learners see their requirements differently. But I think the evidence also shows that not every young person will use them; perhaps the teacher uses them. There is an emphasis, for example, from one pupil there, on that traditional model of revision, namely class notes and his own revision notes, but that he personally also wanted a textbook. So, certainly, the content of a textbook is going to be important, and that that's available in some form or other. It was very interesting to know, for example, that when he was describing the traditional model of revision, he felt that he'd had quite a lot of the content of the textbook through the classroom notes. Much of that digital content, of course, corresponds to the content areas of a textbook, but it's just in a different form. And some of our frustration as well is that the timetables of some individual publishers don't always get us to the point where there is a textbook available in time. That doesn't happen so often in English medium, but we know about that gap in time in the Welsh provision. darren millar am: Well, it's happened fairly regularly in the English-medium textbook world, hasn't it? My daughter\u2014she featured in that video\u2014has got her RS qualifications coming up, and she only had a textbook over the Easter period. You mentioned digital resources; not everybody's got access to digital resources in their own homes, even, in Wales. So, aren't we giving a significant disadvantage to those learners who might need the traditional 'swotting up\u00a0from a textbook' method\u00a0of revision and benefit from that? mike ebbsworth: We do ensure that those digital resources include things that the teachers can also print. Most of these are resources for teachers so that the teachers can\u00a0adapt them for their own use, to suit the learners who are in front of them at any given time. If there are activities, then those\u00a0activities can be printed off and handed to pupils so that they can take them home. gareth pierce: I think you're right that the\u00a0availability of technology is an\u00a0important part of this big picture. The young\u00a0people talk about websites and blogs, and we're talking about digital resources, so being able to reach those resources, I think, is vital in Wales.\u00a0It's interesting to note two contradictory remarks from the teaching\u00a0associations in the letters. One\u00a0teaching organisation says that it\u00a0just creates more work, while another\u00a0organisation says that the digital resource is something that's\u00a0very valuable. Of course, the headteacher at the end was praising the fact that, in a\u00a0situation of\u00a0crisis or\u00a0unacceptable timetables, we have succeeded in\u00a0creating some\u00a0resources that\u00a0will be in the textbook later, but\u00a0available digitally at an early stage. But I agree with your core comment that technology is vital, and access to that, and also the content of a textbook in some form is\u00a0vital as well. darren millar am: Mr Blaker, you would agree that a textbook should be an essential core piece of the resource pack available for each qualification. philip blaker: I think we wouldn't want to underplay the desirability of textbooks, recognising that different learners have different learning styles and may look to different resources. I think what I'd like to raise is a wider concern about textbooks in their current model, which is very much around the fact that\u00a0every time there's a change in a specification, there's a new textbook, which is designed around that specification and is endorsed by an awarding body, which is a nice model for a publisher, because every time there's a change, there's an opportunity for a new textbook. Ofsted and also Estyn have raised concerns about the focus in teaching on teaching to the test as a common concern in both nations. I have a concern that having a textbook that is endorsed by the awarding body and is designed specifically around that specification may lead to some of that tendency. I think I'd much rather see that textbooks are seen as a curriculum resource that are broader than, perhaps, the model of endorsement and the current model of publication suggest. darren millar am: So, you don't think that a textbook for each subject should be a core resource for pupils who are learning in advance of examinations. I think a textbook for each subject is absolutely an essential part of the broad range of resources that you'd want to see available for people to choose what they prefer, but on a subject, perhaps, rather than a specific specification, because I think there's a tendency to conflate the two, and much of the underlying content that is assessed in one specification, or a new updated specification, will remain unchanged. It is true that there may be a different focus or emphasis, or a different style of questioning, but that can be picked up more nimbly through supplementary digital resources, for example,\u00a0which can highlight that change, particularly to a teacher, so that they can shape their lesson planning around that. What we are looking at here are reformed GCSEs and\u00a0reformed A-levels in subjects that are well-established, traditional subjects, and so whilst it is not necessarily the ideal, I think it's\u00a0important to remember\u00a0that there is already a good deal of pre-existing resources, including textbooks, out there in schools already. We're not for a moment saying that that is the situation that we would want everybody\u00a0to be in. I think it might be preferable\u00a0if the textbook was perfectly bespoke to the course and didn't contain any extraneous\u00a0material, but that perhaps is an ideal picture and I think we do need to remember that there are already many resources out there that are available to teachers and to students. darren millar am: But of course, unlike their peers in perhaps other parts of the UK, we have teachers who are having to go meticulously\u00a0through some of these other resources that might be available to determine whether\u00a0they're appropriate for use in the classroom, given that the specification\u00a0is different in terms of the new qualifications. Can I just ask you about the disadvantage that some learners\u00a0might face as a result of the lack of textbooks? Mr Blaker, I note that you sought to reassure the committee in some of your opening remarks about the fact that equivalent outcomes are what you aim to achieve in discussion with the WJEC in terms of the outcome of assessments, and I think that that's a very positive thing. But, how do you differentiate between the different learning styles of individual students who are in that cohort to ensure that the disadvantage that one faces because\u00a0they're somebody who relies particularly\u00a0heavily on textbook-type learning, traditional\u00a0sort of swotting up for examinations, versus someone who is much more digitally aware and able to use digital resources\u2014? How do you make sure that it's fair to the cohort as a whole, while still enabling some of these individuals\u00a0for whom textbooks are important not to face disadvantage within that cohort? philip blaker: The systems that are in place are very much around making sure that awarding is fair across the whole cohort. It's very difficult\u2014in fact, it would be impossible\u2014to unpick all of the different factors that might affect performance, because\u00a0you could well have a textbook that's been available\u00a0for some time, it may be somebody's preferred leaning style to use a textbook, but did they use that textbook effectively? You know, did they open it in revision or did they not open it in revision? So, there are so many different factors that can affect individual\u00a0performance. They particularly wanted to stress this point I think; that the quality of teaching is\u00a0probably the most dominant and the most important factor in relation to a learner's ultimate performance\u00a0in the examination. darren millar am: I understand that, but you also understand that someone who doesn't have the resources that they feel are best suited to them face some element of a greater disadvantage\u00a0than others for whom, perhaps, textbooks are less important. gareth pierce: I think also, perhaps, related to that, it is important to mention digital literacy here. Every young person in Wales, I would hope, taking GCSE or A-level, should have that digital literacy in order to source\u00a0the valuable materials available\u2014that they should have those skills. Then, they have the choice whether they go down the digital route, or do they do as Mike suggested\u2014much of the digital material can be printed\u2014or do they then turn to textbooks, in the hope that those would be available? That would then allow for a pupil's personal learning choice to be reflected. It's also important for teachers to confirm that their ways of teaching do support these alternative approaches taken by pupils. darren millar am: I understand that, but I've got people in my constituency who haven't even got a broadband link at home, so there's a digital disadvantage as well. Can I just ask you about the reason why this has taking so long to sort out? It was back in 2015 that concerns were first raised\u00a0about the availability\u00a0of textbooks in both English and Welsh for the new qualifications. We're three years\u00a0on, what on earth has been happening in the interim and why is it taking so long? If you've got these resources digitally, why can't they just be compounded into textbooks pretty straightforwardly? gareth pierce: I think the main reason for that is that there are three series of reforms of qualifications that have happened. Those three cycles of reform have all suffered from the short timetable\u00a0that was between approving a qualification and publishers being able to start the work. Perhaps an interesting comparison would be a subject being taught for the first time in 2015\u2014where that subject has reached now in terms of resources. I would hope that each one of those subjects have more available now in terms of resources, and therefore we are adding each year\u2014not textbooks but digital resources. So, every subject is moving on over a period of time of five to six years while that specification is being studied. But those same difficulties have, unfortunately, affected 2015 subjects and 2017 subjects, and that's why we're discussing the same thing in 2018. darren millar am: So, it's the scale of the challenge and the volume of the work? gareth pierce: Yes. philip blaker: I think Gareth, in the evidence that he has provided to the committee previously, has said about the timeline, the schedule, for reforms. Now, that's a schedule that we inherited and was largely dominated by the schedule for reforms in England. Now that we've reached a point of divergence in GCSEs and A-levels, between England and Wales, it gives us much more agency in the future to establish a timeline that doesn't place the pressures on the system. So, Gareth has quite\u00a0rightly pointed out that there are three waves of reforms, but the pressures that build up in the first wave are consequential onto the next wave and the wave after that. So, the whole system\u00a0has been pressured both from a regulatory perspective of the approval process, the awarding body preparing its submissions to use, and then system readiness\u00a0thereafter. I assume that advice was given by WJEC and Qualifications Wales and your predecessor organisation to the Welsh Government\u00a0at that time protesting about the timescale\u00a0that you were being expected to abide\u00a0by. gareth pierce: Yes, and similarly in England, the examination boards working in England would have provided the same advice to the Government there. And, of course, the Welsh Government programme was associated with the reform programme in England, in particularly for those A-level subjects, where there was a strong influence from the universities across the UK in terms of what they wanted to see differently in the A-level subjects. So, England and Wales have run on a very short timetable common to both countries, and I would say that every exam board and every publisher has seen this very challenging in Wales and England. But our advice is that there is a real need for between 18 months and two years from completing a specification that has been approved, then being able to work with teachers on what their needs and requirements will be, thinking about what the teaching programme will be, and then starting to work with publishers and get resources available\u2014ideally, with a year of preparation then for the teacher before they start teaching. So, as they will know what resources will be available, we'll be able to discuss the use of those resources in our professional development programmes, and then that timeline is convenient for everybody. llyr gruffydd am: Estyn, NAHT, UCAC, NASUWT, WJEC and Qualifications Wales have pointed to the way in which the Government has managed the reforms that have been happening over the past few years as one of the things that has led to some of these difficulties. Well, what about the tsunami of curriculum reform that we're currently facing? That is, how confident can we be that the situation won't deteriorate as the new curriculum is introduced\u2014rather than improve? gareth pierce: That is a very key question, isn't it? We have started to discuss this, specifically in particular in a forum that includes publishers in Wales, with the Welsh Government around the table and Qualifications Wales around the table. I think one of the very interesting questions and important questions is: what will\u00a0the nature of the information available in April 2019 be\u00a0in terms of the new curriculum? At what level of detail will it be? To what extent will it be adapted again after April 2019? Is it detailed enough, really, for teachers to start discussing their programmes of teaching, and that we then still have a role with publishers, even though this is for this curriculum and not for qualifications? WJEC has a tradition of publishing resources over the key stages and other key stages as well. I think there is a need to discuss the implications of the timetable as it starts to appear, because there is a need to start teaching the new curriculum in September 2022. If we're talking about working on resources available for that preparation year, we're talking about September 2020. So, the timetable does appear already tight, particularly if there's something that's not quite certain about that curriculum statement in 2019, and that there is a lot of work to turn that into teaching programmes. So, I think it is a key question, and I can't be confident at the moment that this is going to work. lynne neagle am: Did you want to come in, Philip? philip blaker: I think one of the big differences is it's a tsunami we can see coming. So, young people will be assessed for the first time, assuming linear exams, in the summer 2027, which is some way away, and, actually, given the reform process historically, this is probably the most foresight\u00a0we've seen of a big change like this. There is a big dependency on the curriculum and the curriculum being described in such a way that we can relate qualifications to that curriculum, because qualifications should relate to the curriculum rather than drive the curriculum, so we do need to see something coming out of that. I think, for us, once we've seen the curriculum, and we've got better sight of it, we'll be able to plan things out. We've already started engagement with awarding bodies over the possible supply chain for these new qualifications, and, ultimately, there'll be a go/no-go decision that would need to be made, probably in 2023, which would be that if the conditions don't appear right for safe implementation, then we would make a recommendation to Welsh Government that these reforms are delayed in terms of the qualification, not in terms of the curriculum, for a year to allow the system to be able to catch up. So, we're starting to plan out not only the whole of the process, but also thinking about where we might have to make key decisions. gareth pierce: Just one very brief comment in that context: I think that the comment of the consortia jointly is important there. They emphasise, in the context of the curriculum, the importance of the autonomy of teachers in interpreting and providing, therefore I think we truly need to discuss that. Does that suggest that there won't be so much need for national resources, or are those resources required to support that autonomy in any case? We need to discuss that at an early stage and in detail, I think. llyr gruffydd am: Yes, certainly, and one is concerned that that conversation isn't already happening, but, yes, okay, you've made that point clearly. If I could return, therefore, to the commercial issue\u2014clearly, there is a shortage of providers in Wales, and we are reliant on others. You suggested that the WJEC may be interested in stepping up and taking some sort of role if regulations were changed. I assume that that would be something that you would be eager to see happening in terms of the change to regulation in that context. I think that I haven't described correctly the purpose of a seminar to encourage interest: the interest is there, but there needs to be an understanding of what the implications are of working towards that kind of\u00a0timetable, what the implications are of working in two languages, what kind of business model, perhaps, would be suitable for the publishers in Wales, how much certainty could be given to them that there is a period of work, because they would want to build their teams, and develop skills within those teams, and to have enough certainty that this is worth doing. And therefore, those are the sort of issues that we're starting a discussion on, in the hope of having a discussion in June to move that forward. Of course, Welsh Government, Qualifications Wales and other stakeholders are part of this discussion, not only WJEC, but we've been part of initiating that discussion. llyr gruffydd am: Is this developing at the pace that you would like to see it developing? gareth pierce: Yes, I think, and there is some enthusiasm. For example, a number of publishers in Wales are within an association describing itself as Cwlwm Cyhoeddwyr Cymru. Myrddin ap Dafydd is chair of Cwlwm at the moment, and there is enthusiasm and vision, certainly. So, there's a wonderful opportunity, I think, for Wales to interpret\u00a0these possibilities swiftly and then hopefully take action on them. llyr gruffydd am: And we're talking here not just about translating but developing resources, and the point, I think, is an important one around some of the evidence that we've received about the importance of developing resources naturally bilingually from the very beginning, rather than having to translate something. Because\u00a0there have been comments that translations are clunky, difficult to follow and not\u2014I'm not saying that they're not fit for purpose, but certainly don't facilitate teaching, perhaps, as easily as one would wish. gareth pierce: Yes, I would agee, and that begins with the authors, doesn't it? We must have the authors\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: So, the expertise, and the same capacty with the publishers as well. gareth pierce: Yes, and we do want to nurture authors within Wales, particularly given that the new curriculum has to do justice to a Welsh dimension within the curriculum in so many different subjects. So, we need authors who can be developed, and authors who would be willing to work with the publishers. llyr gruffydd am: Would that market be viable without any sort of subsidy, if it were to develop bilingually? Or do we have to accept that they have to have an element\u00a0of public subsidy? gareth pierce: Our view in the WJEC is that subsidy will be necessary. Why not rethink that and think of a subsidy for producing resources in two languages for the Welsh curriculum? And perhaps we would need a little more funding for that. But there will be organisations such as the WJEC who will still be interested in contributing, because we are a charity, and within our mission is investment in various things\u00a0that supports education in Wales. llyr gruffydd am: But in terms of where we are now, resources have to be translated. But also, how long is acceptable to wait for a translation, in your view? mike ebbsworth: We've done a great deal of work recently, over recent years, to ensure that that delay between having an English version and a Welsh version is reduced. We are highly aware of the fact that the best-case scenario is that the Welsh and the English are available simultaneously. In those terms, we've taken huge steps forward with the publishers that we've named this morning, so that we have discussed translation as the textbook is being produced. The nature of books is that the author may change his or her mind, or edit as he or she is writing. Well, with that model, we would have to ensure that we approved as we moved forward, chapter by chapter perhaps, so that there would be no changes to be made from then on. At the end of the process, then, the publishers in England have agreed to hold the English version back for a period of time until the Welsh version is available, and then to publish both simultaneously. Unless that timetable is followed throughout the process, there are inherent risks in that process, of course, as I've mentioned in terms of translation as we author materials, and in ensuring that that timetable is stuck to. gareth pierce: And perhaps there is a need to emphasise that the process is translation and editing as a package, and that sometimes the same amount of time goes on the editing, how the Welsh works in terms of diagrams and things that aren't text necessarily\u2014pictures and so forth. So, eight weeks, I think, is the time that we've succeeded in agreeing with the publishers so that we can turn around the Welsh version in that period of time. So, you\u2019re telling us, Mr Ebbsworth, that the WJEC has agreed with Hodder and Illuminate that, in future, even if an English textbook is available for publication, and it\u2019s already late, you will further delay the availability of that textbook so that it can be published on the same day as the Welsh-medium textbook? mike ebbsworth: We can only work on those books that are in the process of being developed. Naturally, if something is late in English, then that timetable would be affected in terms of\u00a0a decision that\u00a0will ultimately have to be taken. But that's the hope: that when new textbooks are produced in English and authored in English, we would look at that eight-week period as a turnaround. darren millar am: I understand the point that you made earlier about the chapter-by-chapter approach, which seems much more equitable. But to suggest that you will delay books that could be available for students and could be available for teachers to be able to access by two months because you haven't got the systems in place to be able to produce them on the same day, seems to be wholly inappropriate. Can I ask, also, why on earth it isn't possible to produce Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translate them to English on occasions? mike ebbsworth: We're entirely open to that and to that sort of model. darren millar am: So, why has that never ever been done? gareth pierce: Well, of course, it would happen with subjects that stem from Wales, but I think the problem is that we work with publishers and those publishers and their authors, therefore, tend to work through the medium of English. But, just to be clear, this idea of delaying an English version is something that the Welsh Government is eager for us to experiment with, but not with textbooks that are already late. They are within the new programme of textbooks that are contained within the grant that you mentioned of \u00a3500,000. So, in a way, this is an experiment and the Welsh Government wants to look at this as one way of responding to the complaint that there are different timetables available. darren millar am: So, you're being forced to do this by the Welsh Government, rather than\u2014 gareth pierce: Well, we've agreed to do it in discussion with them. darren millar am: So, are you happy with that approach? gareth pierce: Well, as long as the textbook isn't late in the first place, then yes; it's worth trying. There is a challenge on the eight weeks, there is a challenge in the publisher sticking to the timetable in terms of the English version first of all, but we are willing to use this as a test bed, and we're working on two specific textbooks on this. lynne neagle am: I think the committee is struggling with this idea, so what do you understand to be the rationale behind that, then? Is it that both sets of pupils should be equally disadvantaged? gareth pierce: Well, no, in a way, it uses the same principle as we have regarding our use of digital resources. With the digital materials, the intention is that things are available\u00a0in time and that they're available in both languages at the same time. So, trying to imitate that with printed text is what we're trying to do, but not with texts that are already late. So, if these books keep to the timetable, then they will be available in time in both languages, but that the English version has stayed before going out on the shelves. llyr gruffydd am: So, that's to say that the English version will be completed eight weeks beforehand so that you have eight weeks for translation. mike ebbsworth: Well, ultimately, I may have used the wrong words in saying that we're holding the English back. The English version would still be in the process, just as the Welsh version would be, and then they would catch up as they approach the date for publication and printing. There is an element of editing the English as well as the Welsh and that would happen in that\u00a0eight-week period. So, a draft\u00a0form might be available, and we do ensure that our draft versions are available on our secure website as soon as possible, but then that has to be held up before publication. john griffiths am: Just on that, Chair, it's nonetheless the case, as we've heard, I think, and as the letter to the committee from Kirsty Williams has made clear, that there might be a situation where the English-language version of a textbook could be made available, but it isn't made available because there isn't a Welsh-language version. And, as the\u00a0Chair said, is that\u00a0about putting those students in Wales on the same footing, and if so, how does that\u00a0relate to the\u00a0fact that\u00a0these students, including those who could have had earlier access to the English-language version, are competing with students over the border, as we heard on the video earlier, for those precious university places? Doesn't it place the English-language student using the English-language version at a potential disadvantage, compared to students over the border? gareth pierce: I think this is a point for Qualifications Wales to a certain extent, but applicants for qualifications in Wales are assessed as a national cohort, if truth be told, so, each piece of information we have on the standards is evaluated for that national cohort. So, in discussion with Qualifications Wales, we ensure that there is no disadvantage to any cohort in Wales in any subject, be that because of a textbook being unavailable or for any other reason. philip blaker: Certainly, from a comparable outcomes perspective, the fewer differences that there are that are differential\u2014. So, the idea of textbooks being available in English and Welsh at different times could potentially create another dimension in terms of disparity. So, if we're looking at it strictly speaking from a comparable outcomes perspective, it makes the awarding easier if everybody's on a common playing field. It's worth remembering\u2014we provided some evidence in our original letter particularly looking at religious studies on the basis that religious studies was a subject that had been mentioned. This subject has already been awarded at AS-level last year, so it has gone through an award and will go through the full A-level award this year. The comparable outcomes approach did protect those learners last year, in the absence of a textbook, and we saw stability in the results that came out of the cohort level. Similarly, with other subjects that have gone through reforms, we've seen it with the GCSEs that were awarded last year, ASs that were awarded last year and A-levels\u00a0that were awarded last year: we saw good comparability year on year. Is that okay, John? darren millar am: Just a very brief follow-up on that, at the cohort level, yes, you suggest that there is some evidence that students were protected, but what you don't know and can't tell, because you're not able to drill down to the individual student level, is whether children, young people, were disadvantaged as a result of their learning style being more textbook orientated than that of their peers. philip blaker: I guess we're in a situation where there's no evidence either way that that\u2014 darren millar am: The absence of evidence doesn't mean that it didn't happen. darren millar am: Well, I think you've seen plenty of evidence about the stress that it's causing, and the concern that learners have about their outcomes. I think it would be very interesting, actually, to take some teacher assessments and expected grades and compare those to the actual grade outcomes. Is that something that Qualifications Wales could do on a sample basis? philip blaker: Historically, that sort of evidence has been very unreliable. Certainly, back in my day at an awarding body they were provided, and there tended to be a very low correlation between the predicted grade and the actual achieved grade. gareth pierce: No, we agree with you that the comparisons are not that reliable, because there are so many factors. But I think, at the end of the day, what we see is, yes, I agree there is evidence of stress, but I think there's also evidence of young people and their teachers really using the available resources and the available skills in approaching revision and preparation, and tending to do that very well. That's the evidence that we've got, for example, in the AS religious studies last year, that the cohort did extremely well in fact. We can't disagree that there's evidence of stress, but I think we can also point towards resilience and excellent approaches to drawing together the various sources that they've got: classroom notes, revision notes, as they mentioned, and the various other materials that they referred to. john griffiths am: Coming back to the effect of the lack of resources, we heard on the video, as you've just mentioned, Gareth, that pupils were experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety, and it affected their well-being in terms of their perception that they might be disadvantaged by the lack of resources, as we discussed. We know exam time is very, very stressful\u2014I'm sure all of us would agree with that\u2014in general, without any additional problems or perceptions of problems. So, with that sort of background, would you accept then that some students have been negatively affected by the lack of suitable support materials for general qualifications? I know we've discussed this in terms of it being difficult, perhaps, to show cause and effect, but I think most people watching that video would clearly come to the view that some students have been negatively impacted. There is evidence of their concern, isn't there? But as Philip said, what we don't have is evidence that that anxiety then has an impact on their attainment, because there are so many factors, there are so many different kinds of resources that they've referred to\u2014even those who want to see textbooks, they're also talking about so many other materials that are available to them. Of course, it's also clear that they are conscientious young people who have worked hard, so you have a picture there of young people who are concerned, yes, and as you've said, examinations are a stressful time in general, but they are also young people who are doing their level best, and usually do get the results that they have worked for. Coming back again to matters that we've already discussed, but just to put to you in a fairly focused way, would you accept that it isn't fair that some pupils are not having the support material that others are having, depending on whether their particular subject is involved and the language that they're studying through? Would you accept that that is a basic unfairness in the system as it currently exists? gareth pierce: Ideally, resources, digital accessibility and digital literacy should be available for every pupil on an equal basis. But I think perhaps if we analysed this in much detail, different individuals would be able to say, 'There are different types of unfairness.' You referred earlier to the digital inequalities. Is there an economic inequality? There is some evidence from the teaching unions that suggests that not every school is in the same situation as each other in terms of buying the resources that are available. So, I think your question drives at a very important point: what sort of inequality could be having an impact on young people in terms of their achievement during their school time? Ideally, each one of those elements of potential inequality should be levelled. So, I don't think I can go any further than acknowledging that any inequality is unfair, but there are so many different kinds and the textbook is not the only one, and therefore we're not going to be able to analyse the impact of that on its own. john griffiths am: Could I put to you, finally then, what Estyn have said about reported delays in the production and distribution of educational resources such as textbooks, marking criteria and specimen papers, that that delay has impeded the ability of teachers to plan adequately, and that this effect on their ability to plan adequately is very likely to have had an impact on pupils' achievement? Would you accept that? gareth pierce: It's interesting\u2014they link three quite different things there, don't they? We've discussed the textbooks in some detail. When they refer to sample assessments, we have to provide those within the regulatory time frame, and they have to be approved. So, in every subject there are sample assessments and marking schemes, and they are statutorily available, in a way. One request that we receive often from schools is for exemplars in terms of the work of pupils that has been assessed and marked by us. Of course, they're not available until the young people have taken those exams for the very first time. But in some subjects the demand has been so strong that we have worked with schools in order to ensure that work is produced by pupils before that first examination, is marked by us, and is then made available. I would like to have a conversation with Estyn, indeed, to interpret on a more detailed level some of the things that they refer to. emyr george: May I offer a comment on that quote from Estyn? They talk about a reduction in attainment and that, to some extent, brings us back to the point in terms of the comparable outcomes method that we're talking about. That method is based on research and evidence that says that in a period of change to an exam or qualification, we know that performance in an exam can fall, and that is due to a number\u00a0of different factors. Certainly, knowing that you're the first to sit that exam perhaps raises your concerns about that examination, and examinations are a matter of concern already. It's very difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate between those factors, but what we know on the whole is that they come together to have an impact on pupils' performance in an exam, and that's why, when it comes to awarding qualifications for the first time and looking at the grades, we look very carefully at what that the mark means in terms of the grade in order to try as best as we can, on the level of the whole national cohort, to eliminate as much unfairness as possible because they are the first cohort to sit the exam. gareth pierce: Could I just make a brief comment on the sample assessments? Now, interestingly, when the English, Welsh, maths, and maths and numeracy GCSEs were new, the Welsh Government were very eager that we invest in more sample assessment materials. We had to produce one for the regulator, but they wanted to see us produce far more, and we did that. If we create more and more sample assessments, then does that create more risk of teaching to the test? And every time we produce one of these, of course, we are using robust assessment ideas, and they're out there to be used for test purposes. So, we need to be careful that we don't weaken\u00a0the real assessment by providing too many of the examiners' good ideas in the sample material. So, it's an interesting theme, but it would be interesting\u00a0to have a further conversation with Estyn on that. I think what we need to do is we need to think about the future reforms, particularly knowing that we've got some on the radar already, and to think about what this paradigm is and how we can isolate some of these factors in the future. So, if we look at resources and if we look particularly at textbooks as being a curriculum resource, rather than a qualification resource, I think we can change the timeline to which some of those materials are produced. So, going back to when I studied my A-levels in the 1980s, there was this common body of knowledge that was an A-level textbook in biology that wasn't focused around an individual awarding body. When we talked to unions about this on Monday, they said, 'Yes, when we used to teach many years ago, there were curriculum resources like that, and then when a particular topic or a particular area of content dropped out of the qualification, we either did or didn't teach it according to whether it was in the curriculum'. That's a little bit worrying by virtue of the fact there might have been a component of that subject that didn't get taught because it was no longer in the text, despite the fact that it was in the common body of knowledge. But I think if we can shift this paradigm\u2014and I would really like to a shift in the paradigm for resources particularly, away from the focus on the qualification and into more of a focus on the curriculum\u2014then that provides an opportunity for, I would suggest, a much healthier model in the future. In the United States, for example, there are some states within the United States that produce a state textbook. Now, that can have issues, particularly if it's politically orientated\u2014so, if politicians are seen to have a strong influence in the content that's taught. Equally, if you look at somewhere like Hong Kong, they've actually tried to de-emphasise textbooks. So, Hong Kong, which is a very high-performing jurisdiction, is trying to move away from that model in the future. gareth pierce: Could I just add very, very briefly\u2014 lynne neagle am: Very briefly, because I want to bring Hefin in. gareth pierce: I know that, in our letter to you, we emphasised that this is not just to do with the body of knowledge.\u00a0The assessment objectives have shifted in many subjects towards analysis and evaluation. So, therefore, we really do need resources that support that way of working, and I'm sure that lots of the young people we've heard from\u2014what they're really doing in\u00a0their revision is actually not just studying the content, but thinking about how they respond analytically and evaluatively.\u00a0In fact, an interesting question for us as an awarding body to debate with the qualifications regulator, maybe, is whether some of the content should actually be able to be taken into the assessment hall.\u00a0Do young people need to remember all these terms and their precise definitions, sometimes in both languages if they've learnt it in that way? Shouldn't some of the reference material be more and more available in the assessment arena? And then you are really getting towards analysis and interpretation and evaluation. hefin david am: I want to welcome these particular comments, because having come from a higher education background, what I've tried to deliver in my courses are\u00a0textbook-free modules, where you're relying on academic journal articles and you're piecing together the story yourself, based on the curriculum you develop yourself. I fear that students who are nurtured on a textbook diet,\u00a0when they go to university, they are not expected to repeat what's in the textbook;\u00a0they're expected to do exactly as Gareth says and analyse and combine information into a discursive argument. So, therefore, I'm interested to know how you've worked with higher education to develop that approach. lynne neagle am: Can I ask for brief answers, please? gareth pierce: Yes, well some of the people who provide\u00a0ideas into our digital resources certainly are either teachers who are very well aware of that progression to HE and therefore what their learners want or, in some cases, they are HE\u00a0people themselves. We do draw on a body of expertise, and we are more than willing to emphasise the importance of that approach to the support resources we provide. hefin david am: I think the difficulty and the difference is that, at HE\u00a0level, the kind of journal articles that are available are probably not consumable at GCSE level. And I think, interestingly\u2014I know we've pointed towards some of our\u00a0religious studies\u00a0resources as examples\u2014I think some of the websites\u00a0we point to are quite ambitious. They would be described as scholarly, and I think some of the young people on the video made that point, didn't they\u2014that they need to engage with that material to understand some themes? But we need to assist them in doing so. We need to almost make those scholarly items that are worth including in their curriculum accessible and user friendly for them at their point of learning. We recently published a report on the Welsh baccalaureate and skills challenge certificate, and I think it's relevant to pull in at this point that the independent study that pupils would be expected to do through the skills challenge certificate in doing their project work is really designed to try and draw out some of those skills that would be relevant in higher education.\u00a0Through the reforms that we are starting to think about for the skills challenge certificate, there's a real opportunity to start honing some of those skills, particularly at the advanced level bacc,\u00a0to make people really HE-ready so that they're better able to engage with that different style of learning. So, I think there's a huge opportunity that shouldn't be diminished within the advanced Welsh bacc. mark reckless am: Gareth, can I just put to you\u2014? On the Estyn criticism, I think you've answered one aspect of their criticism that WJEC\u00a0did not make as many sample assessment materials available as schools would have liked early on in the reform process, and I understand your position there,\u00a0but they went on and said, 'At times the sample assessment materials were provided\u00a0with incorrect mark schemes' and also, 'It would be\u00a0helpful if the WJEC\u00a0ensure that all necessary resources were made available before the start date of each qualification.' Do you have a response to those points? gareth pierce: Again, probably, I'd like a conversation with them about any problems with the specimen assessments and their mark schemes, because if they are the statutory regulatory ones they would have gone through Philip's team as well or his Welsh Government predecessors as regulators, depending on which qualifications they were. Very occasionally,\u00a0somebody will identify an error, and obviously we then correct them, because\u00a0these are available digitally online. So, if there is a problem, we want to hear about it and then we can correct it. But, yes, I agree with their fundamental premise, that ideally the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts, including, as we mentioned earlier, so we can draw on that set of resources in the events we run as WJEC free of charge for teachers leading up to the first teaching. We need that information ourselves as well so we can talk about the use of these\u00a0valuable resources in an appropriate pedagogical context in that preparatory year. mark reckless am: So, what mechanism do you have for picking up on this type of criticisms from Estyn and having that conversation with them? Has that not happened? gareth pierce: We have met with Estyn a couple of times recently, actually\u2014once when they were beginning their review of the key stage 4 qualifications\u00a0that had been in place for two years\u00a0and a bit, and also when they were planning a review of some of the A-level work. Because\u00a0we do have regular meetings with them, we will have an opportunity to explore their comments here I'm sure. mark reckless am: Looking at the structure and the relationship between Qualifications\u00a0Wales and the WJEC\u2014. I understand in the model in England\u2014you've got Ofqual, the regulator, and you have various\u00a0competing\u00a0exam boards, some I think with for-profit motivation. We don't have\u00a0that in Wales; there is a sole regulator and a single, dominant examination board. Does that mean that there's significant overlap and potentially cost duplication between the work of the two bodies, particularly\u00a0given WJEC is a charity and seems to have many of the same objectives as you in Qualifications Wales have? philip blaker: The roles are very distinct, so I'd tell you there's\u00a0no overlap. What we try and do is try and make sure that there's a good connection between the work that we do. I would say a strength of the Welsh\u00a0model is that there is an independent regulator and a single awarding body largely, because\u00a0much of the work that Ofqual would need to do in terms of its maintenance of standards is about ensuring that the competition between awarding bodies doesn't lead to what's been termed in the past as a race to the bottom in terms of standards. Now, the opportunity that we have in Wales is, where we have a single awarding body, we can have a close and good working relationship\u00a0with WJEC, but guarding\u00a0very strongly to make sure that we keep that regulatory distance to make sure that we preserve our role as the regulator and look at WJEC as one of our regulated bodies. gareth pierce: Can I make a general point? Perhaps the important opportunity in Wales is to look anew at how national and regional organisations, such as the consortia, can collaborate to make a success of the broad range of resources and CPD that will be required to support the new curriculum, and also the next set of qualifications that will be reformed. The Learned Society of Wales is a player that wants to introduce ideas into the Welsh dimension of the curriculum. There will be a need for some financial resource from the Welsh Government\u2014yes, certainly\u2014and the WJEC can provide some resources, but I think we all want to collaborate in order to ensure the success of the next round of resources. mark reckless am: But doesn't that national approach and collaboration preclude the model that Philip was talking about\u00a0earlier, where we had textbooks based on the curriculum, and there's that core, but that was separate from what the exam body decided to do and the textbook wasn't there for the particular exam approach? If you have a single, dominant exam board, and you have a Welsh curriculum that's developed with that board, how do you then have this separation\u00a0between textbook and exam? philip blaker: So, if we look at qualification, a qualification should be based on the curriculum that's being offered, because learning should be based around the curriculum, and the role of the qualification is to measure attainment against knowledge of that curriculum\u2014knowledge, skills and understanding, the dispositions that that curriculum is trying to develop. Now, of course, what will inevitably happen is once the curriculum is known and developed, there will be a level of detail that comes across from what the qualification is looking for. I think what we're trying to say is, from an educational perspective, what we'd like to see is a broader focus on the curriculum and less of a narrow focus on the qualification and some of the problems that that can drive, so that, if a learner is well-versed in the curriculum and has been taught well and has acquired the knowledge, skills and dispositions that the curriculum is trying to create, they should succeed in the qualification. mark reckless am: And you suggested earlier that, if need be, the qualification could be pushed back a year, but not the curriculum. Does that mean that it would be possible to teach the new curriculum while keeping the old qualification? philip blaker: It would be possible. mark reckless am: But satisfactory? philip blaker: Because, if we're looking at qualifications predominantly being 14 to 16, what Professor Donaldson said at the very beginning, with 'Successful Futures', was, actually, if the curriculum is preparing people better for that qualification stage, so that they're better versed as learners and better able to perform in those qualifications and we see a rise of attainment\u2014. Ideally,\u00a0you'd be in a position where you've got GCSEs that have been reformed to marry up to any change, but I don't see there being a huge problem in itself of a delay if we think that is the right thing to do. We would much rather be in a position of having reforms, but, equally, I'd want to see any reforms delivered safely, and I wouldn't want to compromise fairness and safety of delivery of those qualifications on the basis of a timeline. But I think all too often the case is that a timeline dominates over doing what is the right thing and I think as we get further into this we'll have to really assess and keep a grip of what's the right thing to do. darren millar am: Just on this issue of shaping the curriculum and making sure that we've got textbooks that can be used to support the delivery of the curriculum\u2014. So, who should be responsible for developing these curriculum resources? philip blaker: I think, for a new model, that needs to be determined. They have responsibility for curriclum and they've already started work with the seminar last year, and then drawing people together now to look at a new model for the future. I think we need to evolve that approach, and I think Welsh Government taking a lead on some of this thinking about how things might be prepared for the future is probably a good position to be in at the moment. darren millar am: Are there any other models that you can point us to in terms of how these things are done elsewhere? philip blaker: Yes, there are models where you can have\u2014. For example, in Northern Ireland, you have the regulator, the awarding body and the curriculum body all under one roof. So, you can have a position where everything is tied together as it is in Northern Ireland with the\u00a0Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment. Equally, if you look at somewhere like Hong Kong, you have very distinct bodies that are looking after each individual component. But, of course, in Wales, and also previously in England, the qualifications regulator has also had a responsibility for curriculum. I mentioned earlier that, in the past, the WJEC has produced a fair few resources in collaboration with publishers in key stage 3 and even at primary stages. Certainly, key stage 3 is closely linked to GCSE, and, therefore, if the WJEC continues to be a player\u2014as I hope it will\u2014in the area of resources for GCSE and A-level, then the WJEC is also well positioned in terms of our investment in editing, translating and the use of technology to contribute to key stage 3 most certainly and perhaps even the primary stages. So, I'm sure that the WJEC would want to offer itself as a national organisation that wants to contribute as best we can in this area. Well, we're out of time, so can I thank you very much for attending this morning and for answering all our questions? I think it's been a very useful and informative session. In view of the time, can I ask whether Members are happy to note all those papers in a block? Can I just flag that I would like to return to paper to note 3, which is the letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education on minority ethnic, Gypsy, Roma and Traveller learners, when\u00a0we go into private, if that's okay with Members? Item 5, then, is for me to\u00a0propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting.\u00a0Are Members content?\u00a0Thank you.<doc-sep>anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): We'll call this meeting to order. Welcome to the fifth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Pursuant to the order passed on Monday, April20, the committee is meeting today to consider ministerial announcements, to allow members of the committee to present petitions, and to question ministers, including the Prime Minister, about the COVID-19 pandemic. Tomorrow, May8, Dr.AndreaMcCrady, Dominion Carillonneur, will give a special recital to mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Victory in Europe Day, VE Day, commemorates the formal acceptance of Germany's surrender by allied forces at the end of the Second World War. While the pandemic prevents us from gathering to celebrate in person, tomorrow at noon the voice of our nation will ring out in remembrance of this milestone in our history. Just so you are aware, the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee. I would like to remind members that, as in the House of Commons or committee, they should not take photos of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of the interpreters and to allow the meeting to proceed smoothly, I would ask you to follow some instructions. When you are ready to speak, click on the microphone icon to activate your microphone, or hold the space bar down while you are speaking. If you release the bar, your microphone will revert to mute, just like a walkie-talkie. Honourable members, I would like to remind you that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should you need to request the floor outside of your designated speaking time, you should activate your mike and state that you have a point of order. If a member of the committee wishes to intervene on a point of order raised by another person, you should use the raised hand function to indicate to the chair that you wish to speak. Should any technical challenges arise, for example, in relation to interpretation, please advise the chair immediately by raising a point of order, and the technical team will work on resolving them. If you get accidentally disconnected, please try to rejoin the meeting with the information you used to join initially. Before we get started, please note that in the top right-hand corner of your screen is a button that you can use to change views. Speaker view allows you to focus on the person currently speaking; gallery view allows you to see a larger number of participants. You can click through the multiple pages in the gallery view to see who is on and how many more participants there are. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. In addition, to ensure a petition is considered properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for a petition certified in a previous Parliament should be mailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. Chair, five years ago when Parliament passed Bill C-14, then justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said that it represented a finely tuned balance between access and safeguards. Petitioners on the first petition I'm presenting are very concerned to see Bill C-7 before Parliament, which removes safeguards ahead of that five-year review. Petitioners specifically mention their concerns about the removal of the mandatory 10-day reflection period, which can already be waived in certain circumstances. They are concerned about reducing the number of witnesses required to oversee it and ensure that a request has been properly made. The second and final petition that I will be presenting today is with respect to Senate Bill S-204. This would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who did not consent. This responds specifically to concerns about organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China involving Falun Gong practitioners and increasing concerns that this is being or about to be applied to Uighurs as well. Petitioners are noting that in the previous Parliament there were bills on this, Bill C-350 and Bill S-240. Now, in this Parliament there is a bill, Bill S-204, and the petitioners hope that this 43rd Parliament will be the one that gets it passed. This is my first occasion to present a petition in our virtual format of the COVID-19 committee. The petition I am presenting today, which was previously approved, is from a number of constituents who are concerned that we pursue the Paris Agreement to hold the global average temperature increase to no more than 1.5C. The Paris Agreement itself embeds in it the concept of Just Transition with a capital J and a capital T, the concept of just transition ensuring fairness and support for all workers in the fossil fuel sector. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to move forward with an act to ensure just transition and to ensure adequate funding so that workers and communities dependent on the fossil fuel sector receive meaningful support to ensure security in their lives in the transition to more sustainable energy use. I want to thank the honourable members for their usual collaboration and now we'll go on to mr. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): On a point of order, Mr. Chair, on Tuesday, at our COVID-19 committee of the whole meeting, I was asking a question which started at 12:56:06 and was cut off at 1:00:32, so I still have 34 seconds of time remaining in my question time of five minutes. If you believe that my time was unjustly cut off and that it was unfair treatment of the official opposition when we were raising our points of order, I would ask that the 34 seconds be tacked on to the opening round for the opposition and credited to Rosemarie Falk, who will be leading off for the Conservatives. the chair: Normally what happens is the chair uses judgment, and with 35 seconds, there isn't enough time obviously for a full question or answer, most of the time. I want everyone to know that I do have a timer next to me and I am timing the questions, and I will be treating the answers the same way. We've taken a little bit of the chair's ability to give judgment on it, but it will be from now on. I would like to remind the honourable members that no member will be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. Will the Prime Minister stand up for Canada's energy workers, or does he agree with the fringe left and those who want to destroy our country? ms. Chair, I believe that the language that the honourable member just used is unparliamentary mr. It is unacceptable to assert that anyone who wants to make a point about our economy is trying to destroy the country. As I pointed out this morning in my press conference, we cannot move forward on a transformation of our energy sector without supporting the workers in that energy sector. We need their innovation and we need their hard work if we are going to lower our emissions, if we are going to reach our the chair: We'll go to Ms. Chair, it has been 43 days since the finance minister promised Canada's energy sector liquidity through the Business Development Bank of Canada. If the government doesn't step up to support our energy sector, they are in effect doubling down on their support for foreign, unethically sourced oil. Chair, when will the credit options be available to Canada's small and medium energy firms? the chair: I want to remind honourable members that we do have interpreters who are listening and translating. Chair, from the very beginning, our priority through this pandemic and this crisis has been to support workers across the country. We have sent billions of dollars to workers right across the country, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, B.C., and Newfoundland and Labrador in the energy sector for them to be able to support their families through this difficult time. The announcements to date fall well short of what is needed to maintain a steady supply of affordable and healthy food. Instead of responding to specific COVID-19 challenges, our farmers are facing the Liberals' reannounced $125 million that was already budgeted in the AgriRecovery program. Will the Prime Minister finally step up and take our food supply chain seriously, or is agriculture just an afterthought for him? right hon. Chair, we take agriculture and our agricultural sector extremely seriously, which is why we announced hundreds of millions of dollars a couple of days ago to respond to pressing needs. We will continue to make investments to ensure both the safety of workers in our agricultural sector and the safety of our communities, as well as the continued flow of high-quality Canadian food onto our tables right across the country. Our farmers are faced with rising operational costs, a disrupted service industry, labour shortages and a reduced capacity at processing plants. When will the Prime Minister deliver adequate support to address the critical changes facing our ag industry? right hon. Chair, I would suggest respectfully that the honourable member take a look once again at the announcement we made, which actually highlights significant new investments to support our agricultural industry. Every step of the way in this unprecedented situation, we've been moving forward on doing more, on adjusting and on investing more. We need to support our agricultural sector and the people who work so hard to put food on Canadians' tables right across the country and we will continue to. Chair, Canadians expect to find healthy and affordable food at their grocery stores, but if the government does not take action now, that's not a given. It is an enormous hit to their bottom line, and the recent carbon tax hike is taking even more money out of the pockets of farmers at a time when they can afford it the least. Will the Prime Minister exempt all farm operations from the carbon tax and reimburse the money that they have already taken from them? right hon. Chair, it's a shame to hear the member opposite accidentallyunintentionally, I'm certainmislead the House and Canadians. This is the way of creating a better future for our kids and grandkids, which I know people in communities right across the country, including our farm communities, want to see happen. We are moving forward in a responsible way to put a price on pollution and put more money in average Canadians' pockets. marilne gill (manicouagan, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I am thinking about the lobster fishery in the Magdalen Islands, the crab fishery on the Cte-Nord or those fishing for herring in the south of the Gasp. Because imports have ceased, because the domestic market is weak and in decline because of the interruption of the tourism and restaurant industries, the fishing industry and its fishers must be supported. justin trudeau: Our fishers do exceptional work that is extremely important in feeding Canadians and in contributing to our economic success through their exports around the world. I know about the processing industry and the $62.5million to be used essentially for freezing products, but I am talking about the fishers themselves. In addition, they feel that they will be losing money, because of the drop in the price of their resource. They are just as essential as farmers, but they are going to have to work at a loss and they are not going to have workers to assist them. Are you going to do anything else, in addition to the assistance of $62.5million? Time is of the essence. We recognize the challenges that fishers must face in terms of social distancing and of work that is often seasonal. We are going to continue working with the industry, with the fishers, and with the coastal communities in order to ensure that people have confidence in their abilities and in their future. In times of crisis, it is important for the government to be there to support people, and that is exactly what we are going to continue to do. But, given the cyclical nature of the industry, some sectors have had to postpone for several weeks the preparations they need for fishing activities. The current program could be modified in a number of ways, to accommodate the cycle, the dates, and the size of the companies. They would really like to take advantage of the $40,000loan, but they cannot because of their payroll. I can already suggest a number of solutions to the government and to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, that would bring help to those businesses very quickly. The fishers carry on, because it is a duty for them, because they want to help us and to be part of the effort at this time of crisis. I would really like to hear a guarantee that they will be supported, that they will be able to put food on the table this year, and that they will be able to support the communities that often depend on the fishing industry, a major industry in those communities. justin trudeau: Minister Jordan has been working with the fishers, the fishing industry and the communities affected by the crisis since the crisis began. From the outset, our priority has been to support the millions of Canadians from coast to coast who have lost their jobs. We have been able to do so, but we are going to continue to work for those who must now face difficulties. the chair: Before we move to the next question, I would like to remind members of the committee to speak slowly, and to address their remarks to the chair and not directly to each other. They've seen revenues plummet, and at the same time the cost of delivering municipal services has risen. As the Prime Minister knows, municipalities are unable to run deficits and so they are facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that Canadians depend on. They're going to be even more important during the recovery, especially when it comes to delivering on the infrastructure programs before us. My question for the Prime Minister is, when can they expect federal financial support to arrive? right hon. Chair, no government in Canada's history has done more to work with our municipalities, with our cities, with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to respond to the challenges they're facing and to partner with them. Things from infrastructure to investments have made a huge difference right across the country in the quality of life of Canadians in towns, large and small, from coast to coast to coast. As I'm sure the member well knows, our Constitution requires that most of the funding for municipalities flow through the provinces. We are working with the provinces, as we continue to work with the cities, to ensure that we're able to support this order of government that delivers the vast majority of services to Canadians with very little financial means. Chair, it would seem that the federal government has the fiscal capacity and the responsibility to help municipalities weather this crisis. Transit systems have been hit particularly hard and have seen the bulk of the layoffs in the municipal sector. These transit services carry essential workers to work, whether they are health care workers, grocery store workers, janitors or others. We will see service cutbacks precisely at a time when we want to be expanding transit and improving transit in our communities. Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that the federal government needs to step in to safeguard and protect Canada's transit services? right hon. Chair, this federal government recognizes how important it is to support all Canadians, which is why we put forward unprecedented measures to help millions upon millions of Canadians with the CERB and with the wage subsidy. I'll be having a conversation with all other first ministers tonight to talk about a broad range of issues. We have continued to engage with them, but again, it is important to respect the Constitution and understand that funding for municipalities and cities does go through the provinces. The federal government is happy to be there to support, but it must be the chair: We will go to Mr. Chair, I am wondering how the Prime Minister could explain to a bus driver in Vancouver who has been laid off that as a public sector worker, she can't access the federal wage subsidy, while an equivalent worker in the airline industry gets to keep her job with the federal help of that program. Chair, I'm happy to explain to the member and to all Canadians that our Constitution creates federal areas of jurisdiction and provincial areas of jurisdiction. The airline industry, like banking, like telecommunications, is a federal area of jurisdiction that we have been able to move forward on. More than that, we brought the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy to all industries across this country, because we knew that as the federal government, it was something that we needed to step up on the chair: We will go back to Mr. Faced with minimal health care capacity, remote indigenous communities in my riding are taking matters into their own hands. The Nuxalk have put up a checkpoint on Highway 20 to protect community members and prevent non-essential travel. In particular, it is to protect the three remaining fluent speakers of the Nuxalk language, these cherished elders in their community. The Haida on Haida Gwaii have set up a similar checkpoint, as have communities throughout British Columbia, yet federal support for indigenous communities amounts to only $39 million for all of the indigenous communities in B.C. Does the Prime Minister not agree that more support is warranted to help indigenous communities in my riding and across the country? right hon. Chair, from the very beginning, we made funds available to Canadians right across the country, particularly people in indigenous remote or northern communities who we knew would be facing more difficult challenges because of the existing vulnerabilities in their health care system and socio-economic circumstances. We have made unprecedented investments and we will continue to make the necessary investments, because we need to make sure that indigenous Canadians, and indeed all Canadians, have the supports they need to make it through this crisis. luc berthold (mganticl'rable, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr.Chair. I am going to keep talking about the area of jurisdiction that the Prime Minister likes to talk about, except that I want to point out the incompetence of the Liberals in keeping their commitments on infrastructure projects. As the provinces gradually restart their economies, can the Prime Minister tell us how many projects that the provinces have submitted are waiting for approval from his government? mr. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, I hope that the length of the pause will not be taken out of my time. catherine mckenna (minister of infrastructure and communities): I'm sorry, Mr.Chair, I was on mute. It is very important to build projects that will create good jobs the chair: We are returning to Mr.Berthold. How many projects are currently awaiting government approval? I know that the minister has been meeting virtually with the provinces over the last few days. Rather than wait for the right political opportunity to approve these files, will the minister commit today to respecting the provinces and approving by next week all the projects that are sitting on her desk? hon. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, I'm pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories. We will announce the approval of projects because it's very important for our economy, our communities and creating good jobs. luc berthold: Does the minister understand that she hasn't told us how many projects are still pending? The construction season is very short. Approval of a project in July means that work can't begin until next year, which won't help revive our economy. catherine mckenna: I want to make it clear that we have approved hundreds of projects in the last few weeks. These projects are important for the economy and the environment, as well as for jobs the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, while the minister is calling for a green recovery of the country's economy, public transit is at risk. The Union des municipalits du Qubec estimates that the monthly losses are between $75million and $100million. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, we recognize the importance of public transit for our economy, since some essential workers use public transit. As the Prime Minister said, it's the provinces that must help because the money the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, once again, what we're hearing is that the government is passing the buck to the provinces. Unfortunately, the minister was unable to answer a single question about the number of infrastructure projects still on the federal government's desk, which is very important. In terms of the number of projects that we've approved, I would be happy to inform the hon. member of the exact number of all the approved projects that my department has been working very hard on over the past few months to approve projects to go forward. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, do I have any time left? the chair: No, your time is up. On March 28, the minister personally tweeted out a thank you to the People's Republic of China for donating PPE to Canada. More recently, Taiwan donated half a million surgical masks to Canada, yet here we are, two weeks later, and the minister has yet to personally thank Taiwan for its generosity. I can say, after my COVID foreign ministers call, that the world community has come together to make sure that supply chains will remain intact and that we will have transit hubs and air bridges. Chair, I didn't hear a thank you there, so I'm going to try again. On May 4, the Government of Taiwan delivered 25,000 surgical masks to the Government of British Columbia. Minister of Citizens' Services Anne Kang and Minister of State for Child Care Katrina Chen, who, as ministers, officially thanked the Government of Taiwan for its donation. Again, will the minister now do the right thing and, on behalf of Canadians, recognize the generosity of Taiwan and thank its government for that timely donation? hon. Chair, as I said to you before, Canada is grateful to all who have given supplies to Canada. As I said, when it comes to global health, when it comes to helping each other, I think it is a duty for all to come together. We are grateful and thankful for all those who have agreed to help Canada and Canadians from coast to coast to coast in times of need. I've repeated that and have said many times in many forums that we are grateful and thankful to all of those who are helping Canada. The Government of Taiwan has been the world leader in successfully fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, the People's Republic of China continues to oppose Taiwan's membership in the World Health Organization. Will the minister now do the right thing and assure Canadians that he will fully support efforts to grant Taiwan membership in the World Health Organization? hon. That said, we support Taiwan to continue meaningful participation in international multilateral forums, particularly when it comes to health. We also believe that Taiwan's role as an observer in the World Health Assembly meeting is of interest to the international health community and we have been supportive of that. Can he tell us exactly how many Canadians remain abroad who have expressed a desire to be repatriated? hon. As of today, we have repatriated more than 20,000 Canadians on 232 flights from 87 countries. As the Prime Minister and I have said from the beginning, we will make our best effort to repatriate everyone who wants to come back home during the crisis. My office has received correspondence from Canadians concerned that trial delays due to COVID-19 may result in criminals walking free. As this government has been working overtime to criminalize law-abiding citizens with new and useless gun laws, will the Minister of Justice ensure that real criminals will not walk free as a result of delays in the justice system? hon. We have been working with my provincial counterparts across Canada, as well as with the various federal courts and also, through my provincial counterparts, with the superior courts and courts of appeal across Canada. Each particular jurisdiction has taken measures to ensure that basic essential services within the court system are maintained, through a variety of means, and we believe that we will be able to solve these various challenges. Chair, the regional relief and recovery fund was announced weeks ago as a way to help small and medium-sized businesses in rural communities, like those in my riding. Can the minister clarify whether we are days away or weeks away from this support flowing to the businesses that need it so desperately? hon. Chair, I had the chance to talk with many of the chambers of commerce and business owners throughout Atlantic Canada, and we hear their anxiety. That's why ACOA's doing great work on the ground to make sure we can help them through this very difficult period. We have increased the budget of ACOAgood newsand I'll be coming up with the details very soon. It will be a pleasure to collaborate with him to make sure that we can help many businesses and business owners across the Atlantic region. In particular, they are unable to access the emergency business account, because they do not have a payroll. There are hundreds and thousands of small businesses in this very situation, vital small businesses in our communities, but they do not meet this requirement. What does the Minister of Finance have to say to these small businesses that are suffering right now? hon. I want all the businesses that he is talking about and all of them throughout the country to know that we continue to work very hard to make sure they're supported through this difficult period. We know that businesses are being supported through getting access to the wage subsidy to keep their employees together, and they're getting help, whether it's with rent or to defray costs by deferring GST and HST or customs duty payments. Some have a personal account that they've dealt with over the years rather than a business account, and that makes them ineligible. Chair, small businesses are concerned about their ability to survive, and no amount of deferrals, loans or subsidies can substitute for their need to be open and servicing their customers. Can the government confirm that a sectoral risk analysis has taken place to assist the provinces in reopening the economy? hon. Chair, I can assure the member that we've been very clear in terms of our strategy around reopening the economy. We need to make sure that we follow the advice of the experts and the health authorities to do so in a manner that does not compromise the health and well-being of Canadians. We of course will have a sectoral lens, and as you can see by some of the initiatives and the support packages we've put forward the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Can the government confirm that the programs currently in place will be expanded to these hard-working Canadians? hon. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we continue to work with all of our small businesses and I want to thank him for raising this very important issue. I want to assure our Canadian small businesses that we are going to continue to do this work to make sure they are supported. james cumming: Can the minister give me a date when she will be able to announce to these businesses that they will be eligible? hon. mary ng: I want to assure our Canadian small businesses of their importance and of the importance of their contributions to all of our communities. I want them to know that we continue to listen and that we will ensure that they are supported and continue to be supported during this difficult time. Can you give me a date when I can tell these thousands of businesses they will be supported if they pay dividends or if they use contractors within their businesses? hon. The landlord says that he doesn't have the 25% needed to be eligible for the program because he's already paying for common area costs and deferrals on utilities, which he will have to pay on his mortgage. Will the government reform the rent relief program to focus on tenants and not just the landlords? hon. Chair, I want to let the member know that we are working to make sure that the details of the emergency program for rent are out there so that both tenants and landlords can understand the situation. We're seeing a significant number of both landlords and tenants coming forward to register for this program, and we are convinced that it will be in the best interests of landlords to move forward and give tenants this relief. Chair, we've been hearing, however, from small business owners that their landlords don't find the government's rent relief program appealing enough. Can the government confirm, given the program's low eligibility rate, that the program will be expanded and be more efficient in helping tenants? hon. Chair, we recognize that it's critically important that all of the details of this program be out there for landlords and tenants to understand. This is a program that we've put out within the last week, and we are confident that it's in the best interests of tenants and landlords. One easy way to do that would be to expand the Canada summer jobs program to businesses with over 50 employees. Will the government consider doing so to allow students to gain that very valuable work experience over the coming months? hon. The second uptake provided employers across the country with the ability to add their needs for students to the mix. During this pandemic, the government has consistently called for a team Canada, non-partisan approach, and I was glad to hear that said a little earlier today. However, at the same time, the current government has used a parliamentary back door to launch a poorly thought out gun ban. We have a government that didn't win the popular vote, and I'm just wondering how I explain to my residents, because I'm getting so many calls, that this is not a bloated response because, quite frankly, it is. Chair, I think the honourable member can explain to his constituents that the forming of regulations through order in council is actually the process prescribed in law in Canada under section 117.15 of the Criminal Code. I would also invite the member to advise his constituents that way back in 1991, when there were some Conservatives who called themselves Progressive, the Mulroney government brought forward, in Bill C-17, the authority under that section for an order in council to prescribe specific makes, models and variants of military firearms as prohibited or restricted. terry dowdall: I'm not sure, but I'm hoping, that I'll get an honest answer on this question from the minister, who has everything from rocket launchers to basically toy guns on the ban list. When will we get the cost of this buyback program? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to please be careful in their language when they are referring to others. I won't comment on this one particularly, but I want all of you to be very, very careful when referring to other members. Chair, to respond to some of the obfuscations and deceptions that have been put out there. I think it's very clear, and I invite the member to look at the list of weapons that are the chair: We'll go back to Mr. bill blair: Actually, I'm very much looking forward to bringing forward legislation as soon as the House resumes. We will have a vigorous debate in Parliament about the form a buyback will take and we will bring forward a budget at that time. bill blair: If people are illegally in possession of the weapons and they're committing a crime, they will be dealt with for the crimes they commit. Canadians in my riding who suffer from cystic fibrosis are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. While these Canadians with existing lung conditions are incredibly worried about a virus that attacks the ability to breathe, the good news is that there are life-saving medicines for those with CF. I am wondering if and when the government will correct these guidelines and give access to life-saving medicines for our most vulnerable. Chair, as you know, the government has been very committed to improving access and affordability for prescription medications for all Canadians. The PMPRB regulatory amendments will help Canadians be able to afford their prescriptions, and Canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines. In fact, many countries with much lower medicine prices gained access to new medicines in the same time frame as Canada frame, or even faster, so we are excited to do this work. Chair, our seniors are being particularly hard hit right now during this pandemic, yet seniors have not been given any direct support. Funding to charities like the United Way is being labelled as support for seniors, but most won't see any of this support. Seniors in my riding have asked for an increase in their CPP and OAS, and to be able to make untaxed bulk withdrawals from their RRSPs while they still have some value. deb schulte (minister of seniors): I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. the chair: You might want to try your space bar and keep it down while you're speaking. I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. We've reduced the minimum RRIF withdrawal by 25%, and we've made the CERB available to working seniors who have lost their jobs due to the COVID pandemic. We know there's more work to do, and we'll have more to say in the future. the chair: I want to remind honourable members that if there are issues, we are taking note of them, and we'll hopefully resolve them by the next meeting. marie-hlne gaudreau (laurentideslabelle, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. In fact, we have been looking at a number of ways to support increased contact tracing across the country, including working with provinces and territories to boost their capacity through human resources and volunteer organizations. Anything we put forward as a digital tool to assist with contact tracing would be thoroughly considerate of Canadians' privacy rights. But you know as well as I do that the Privacy Commissioner has been calling us to task for a very long time now, because there is also a crisis of confidence. You know as well as I do that for 90%of Canadians, the misuse of their personal data is a cause for concern, whether it be for profiling or business development purposes. I'd like to know whether this commitment will be implemented quickly so that legislation can be passed on this issue, in this case the Privacy Act. We're talking about what is going on in Quebec, among other places, and I would like to make sure that the federal government commits to respecting the proposals regarding geolocation and contact tracing possibilities, with full respect for the right to privacy. We have worked very closely with provinces and territories for a long time before the outbreak, but certainly ever since the outbreak. We respect the rights of jurisdictional authorities to use tools that have been properly vetted through their own provincial and territorial legislation. marie-hlne gaudreau: Concerning privacy, there are 30million Quebeckers and Canadians who have had their personal data leaked. Why is it that our laws don't allow us to apply financial penalties so that we can then go further? The very basis is to be concerned about our fundamental rights. As the critic for access to information and privacy, I'd like a commitment that the federal government will deal not with what the provinces are doing, but with the Privacy Act. the chair: Your time is up, but I'll give the floor to the minister for 30seconds. Our government will ensure the privacy of Canadians is respected, support responsible innovation and take reasonable steps to strengthen enforcement powers. yvan baker (etobicoke centre, lib.): Thank you very much, Mr. Minister, in my riding of Etobicoke Centre, we are mourning the loss of 40 residents to COVID-19 at the Eatonville long-term care centre. Of all Canadians who have died from COVID-19, 79% were living in long-term care homes. I understand that long-term care homes fall within the jurisdiction of provincial governments in Canada, but this is a crisis. What is the federal government doing right now to help protect our seniors who are living in long-term care homes from COVID-19? What will we do to reform our long-term care homes in the future to ensure that our seniors in Etobicoke Centre and across Canada get the care they deserve? hon. We are deeply concerned by the outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities, and our thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one. As my colleague mentioned, while these facilities are regulated by provinces and territories, we have been focused on protecting the health and safety of long-term care residents and staff while working with our partners in a team Canada approach. We're working with the provinces and territories to cost-share a temporary salary top-up for long-term care workers. We are working through investing $2 billion to secure personal protective equipment for the health of workers, including those in the long-term care homes, and we've deployed the Canadian Armed Forces to assist 25 long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario. We all have a role to play to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect our seniors and caregivers. At the finance committee, we've heard a lot of concerns from all sectors of the economy as a result of COVID-19 and we've been presented with quite a number of possible solutions as well, several of which the government has acted upon. It is very welcome support, but I sincerely believe the farm sector will be taking the Prime Minister up on the suggestion that $250 million should be seen as an initial investment. However, as a result of reduced processor contracts for next year, plus cancelled seed contracts, millions of dollars of seed and process potatoes have no home. How does the minister see Tuesday's announcement addressing potato farmers' concerns? Second, in 2013, long-term financial safety nets were gutted by the Harper government. We know the importance of our potato farmers, and that's why we are launching a first-ever surplus food purchase program, a $50-million fund designed to help redistribute existing inventories, such as potatoes, to local food organizations. On the financial safety net that we have in place for our farmers, called the business risk management program, we announced up to $125 million in funding through AgriRecovery and made changes to AgriStability that will help producers quickly. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that BRM programs, including AgriInvest, are there to help farmers in difficult times. Robyn, who has owned Arbutus Health in Tofino for over 13 years, can't apply for the Canada emergency business account loan, simply because she doesn't have a payroll of over $20,000. With no business income and without emergency financing, it is virtually impossible for her to pay her bills or come up with the 25% needed for the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program. The government promised to be flexible and willing to adjust its COVID response rollout so that nobody falls through the cracks, but Robyn, like tens of thousands of proprietors who are the economic job creators of our communities, urgently needs the government's help now. Will the government amend its programs to help more business owners so that people like Robyn don't lose their businesses? hon. I know he and I have talked about this, and I appreciate the input and the feedback that he is providing from business directly. I want to assure Robyn and her businesses, and many businesses across the country, that we are absolutely listening, and we will continue to make sure we are supporting those businesses during this period. We also know that more has to be done, and we will continue to work with you and businesses across the country so that we can indeed give them that necessary support to weather this difficult period of COVID-19. I was talking to Heather last night, who also owns a business in Tofino, Basic Goodness Pizzeria, with her partner Marco. Like many proprietors of family businesses who aren't on payroll, they don't qualify for the business loans. Now with the new rollout of the rent support, they're not sure if their landlord is willing to play ball and even apply. Heather was in tears last night as she told me that they have done nothing wrong to deserve being excluded from these emergency programs. Will the government fix the rent support program so that tenants can apply, instead of leaving it up to landlords, and so businesses can get the help they desperately need? hon. We've been working on offering a response for small businesses and charities and non-profit organizations, and we are continuing to listen on the ground to how we can better assist the businesses that fall through the cracks. Chair, when the government rolled out its commercial rent support program, why didn't it negotiate an eviction moratorium with the provinces, as Australia and other countries did, to protect business owners? hon. We've recognized it and we've been working with the provinces and territories to implement the Canada emergency commercial rent the chair: We'll go back to Mr. gord johns: To qualify for the Canada emergency wage subsidy, a 30% drop in revenue has to be shown. Anyone who's owned a business knows that even with this program, it's going to be hard to survive. Why is the government using a 70% measurement drop to qualify for the rent support program, but a 30% drop for the wage subsidy? hon. We've been working with provinces and territories to provide forgivable loans to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rents for their tenants by 75%. We're hoping that tenants and landlords will be working together so we can support businesses during this very difficult crisis. the chair: Before we move on to the next question, Mr.Berthold, did you have a question or a point of order? mr. I checked the clock from the first round of five minutes, and as you may recall, it took a very long time for me to get an answer from the government. During my first turn, it took 50seconds before a government minister deigned to answer my questions. After checking my time, I realized that the discussion between Ms.McKenna and I went on for four minutes and 14seconds, so I wasn't able to ask the minister one final question, a very important one. I would ask you to take that into account and allow me to ask MinisterMcKenna one last question, please. the chair: The person chairing the meeting uses their judgment and does their best to keep an eye on what's going on. I think it's more or less equal for all the members, but I apologize if the honourable member feels that he was denied a few seconds. bill blair: The decision to close the border was made in Canada by Canadians in the best interest of Canadians. todd doherty: When will the government be in a position to inform Canadians of any changes to the agreement? hon. bill blair: I'm pleased to advise the member that we're continuing to monitor the situation, but I'm strongly of the opinion that the circumstances on both sides of our border do not indicate that this is the right time to make a change in the restrictions. todd doherty: Can the government confirm whether there are any discussions about reopening the border to certain modes of transportation and restricting others? the chair: Before I go to the minister, I want to remind the honourable members that we do have translators, and they are trying to translate. With respect to them, I know we're trying to get as many questions in as possible, but they do have to translate them, so please be considerate of our interpreters. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Let me please inform the honourable member that we are, of course, aware that the current agreement expires. navdeep bains: We are engaged with the industry, and we are working with them on a solution, Mr. Chair, will this relief package include funding for airline ticket refunds similar to what other countries around the world have done? Yes or no? hon. Chair, I can confirm that Air Canada has now adopted a policy of checking temperatures for passengers boarding Air Canada flights. Last week I asked the Minister of Labour if they were aware of a letter written on April 6 by CUPE to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Minister, were you aware of that letter? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly. todd doherty: On April 6, CUPE wrote a letter to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Before that I had conversations with CUPE with respect to flight attendants and the use of personal protective equipment. todd doherty: Can the minister confirm whether or not they have provided PPE to the flight attendants and/or training for front-line staff for airlines and airports? hon. This has become a policy to ensure the safety not only of passengers on board but also of the flight attendants and flight crew. He stated that he couldn't give his small business tenants a break on rent because the government is penalizing him for paying off his mortgage. Chair, as you know, we laid out the CECRA program just last week, and we are encouraging landlords to take that opportunity to support the renters. Is the minister aware of this, and are they trying to revise the CECRA program? hon. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with provinces and territories to present that program. We are asking, actually encouraging, landlords to do their part and help tenants, like the one you mentioned, go through this. It's been heartbreaking, frankly, to hear that everything they've built and sacrificed for is in serious jeopardy, and through no fault of their own. Your government has created programs that are supposed to help them, but many legitimate businesses aren't able to apply. I'm hoping to hear specifics, not just nice words, on what you're going to do to help them. First, businesses that recently incorporatedfor example, in late 2019are unable to apply their entire 2019 payroll. As a result, many are falling short of the $20,000 payroll threshold required to qualify for this loan. What is your government going to do about these three scenarios? the chair: I just want to remind honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly to the minister. As well, please take into consideration the interpreters, who have to listen and translate, so that we can have this conversation. Right from the very beginning, we've always said that we will listen and that we will work to make sure that measures go out to help our Canadian small businesses. She's absolutely right: 98% of all our businesses in this country are small businesses, so they absolutely contribute enormously to our communities and are job creators. For the Canada emergency business account, over 550,000 small businesses have been approved and are getting that support. I can assure the honourable member that we will continue to do this work so that businesses, all businesses, are supported, whether it is helping keep your employees together, helping with rent support, helping to keep your business's expenses low, or of course helping with the capital that is needed so that you can pay your operating expenses and your bills through this difficult time. Moving on, there are two issues regarding the 50% commercial rent assistance subsidy, where landlords pay 25%, the government pays 50%, and the tenant is responsible for 25%. First, many of the small landlords aren't able to take a 25% hit to their income, and are unable to provide the subsidy to their tenants. Second, with the 70% decline in revenue threshold for small businesses to even be eligible for the rent assist, many restaurants are at 65% or 67% decline. What is the government planning to do to streamline this program for small businesses that can't access but desperately need the rent subsidy? hon. Chair, as the Minister of Official Languages, I just want to raise the fact that interpretation is very complicated right now. In order to make sure that we can continue to uphold bilingualism within the House, I would love it if my colleagues could take down the pace a bit. I just want to remind everyone again that when you're asking a question, make sure you are doing it at a pace at which you're considering the people who are interpreting ms. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with the provinces and territories to provide this forgivable loan to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rent of their tenants by 75%. It will be very important that we understand what happens across the country, and we will monitor and adapt the program as we ms. Chair, it has been in the media quite a bit that this rent subsidy is not helping many, many, many small business owners. It's falling short of everything that was announced, so I think it needs to be taken a bit more seriously than that. We know that some still fall through the cracks and we will look at how we can continue to support businesses across the country. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We are now going to Mr. Three weeks ago, on April 17, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced funding of $500 million to assist Canada's arts, sports and cultural sectors. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Madam Chair, we will be releasing the details of that announcement, and how the money is going to be spent, in the coming days. kevin waugh: We all know that many media organizations, large and small, in Canada are struggling right now. Allegations have arisen that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, is currently engaging in predatory behaviour and taking advantage of the current situation to harm its competitors using rate cuts. kevin waugh: Local community and ethnic media outlets and papers have strong ties to their communities that often go much deeper than the major media outlets. Is the government currently using any local or ethnic media outlets to provide crucial coronavirus information through advertising? hon. We need to get the information to Canadians on COVID-19, which is why we have started an ad-buy campaign of $30 million, which is being distributed in more than 900 local, regional and national newspapers across the country and 500 radio and TV stations in 12 different languages, including Farsi, Mandarin, Spanish, Italian and many more. It has received two ads from an ad agency in connection with the $30 million the government is doling out to help media outlets. Is this the kind of money you're attempting to dole out to help media: two ads in eight weeks? hon. steven guilbeault: Madam Chair, we have been doing a number of things for our media in Canada over the last few months and will continue to do so. On top of that $30 million ad-buy campaign, we have been investing $50 million in local journalism. Just this year, it means that 200 journalists will be hired in areas across the country where journalism is more poorly defined. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, last week, as the minister would know, 15 community newspapers, including eight in Manitoba and seven in the province of Ontario, closed their doors for good. Is the government currently planning any further measures aimed at assisting community or ethnic media organizations? We understand that many more will close their doors within the next 30 to 60 days. steven guilbeault: We are planning a number of other measures, some of which will be included in the $500 million. Of the $595 million that the media will receive, we have a tax credit that has now entered into force, and the cheques should be in the mail by the end of the summer. So there are a number of things we've done and a number of things we will be doing in the coming months as well. kevin waugh: Well, finally, you have the five members associated with that committee to dole out the $595 million. colleague that in order for us to provide tax breaks for the 2019 period, media outlets had to file their tax returns so we could go ahead. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. This being the first time I've had the floor during a virtual sitting of Parliament, I'd like to take this opportunity to greet my fellow members, all 259participants. I'd like to talk about the Prime Minister's appearance on the show Tout le monde en parle. This is what he had to say about his economic recovery plan:     We are going to remain focused on the economy as a wholeinnovationresearch and science, the green economy and a fairer economyThere are things we are all reflecting on right now that reflection is going to continue. Can the government assure Canadians that it is being proactive and working on a plan to get the economy moving again? It must act now. Our government is wholly committed to restarting the economy, and we are working closely with the provinces to do just that. Last week, our government, together with the provincial and territorial premiers, released the principles that will guide efforts to restore economic activity across the country. jol godin: MadamChair, before we go any further, since it took a while for the minister, or the government, to answer the question, can I have that time back to ask questions? the acting chair (mrs. The Prime Minister's answer during his appearance on Tout le monde en parle didn't inspire much confidence and doesn't line up with the Deputy Prime Minister's comments. How can the government be proud of announcing $252million in assistance for the agri-food sector, when that is less than 1% of all the program funding the government has committed to help Canadians get through the COVID-19 crisis? Clearly, the government doesn't see the food supply chain as a priority and has no regard for farmers and pork and beef producers. Does the government realize that eating is vital to Canadians? When is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food going to adjust the program and show respect for Canadian farmers? hon. This week, we focused on beef and pork producers and processors, as well as sectors with product surpluses that can be redirected to food banks. I can assure my fellow member that this is an additional step and that more supports are on the way in the weeks ahead. PortneufJacques-Cartier is home to a company that is already licensed by Health Canada and that, for 20years, has been manufacturing medical equipment including masks, face shields and thermometers. In mid-March, Health Canada reached out to the company to find out how much equipment it could manufacture to help fight COVID-19. The company confirmed that it could immediately start producing 200,000masks a week, ramping up to a million masks over the next few weeks. Can the health minister tell us why, 45days later, this company licensed by Health Canada hasn't received an order? hon. Industry and suppliers have enthusiastically answered our call to equip Canada with products and goods during the crisis. Seniors living alone are most at risk of economic insecurity, particularly single senior women, as gender inequality in the job market has translated all too often into inadequate retirement income. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a poverty reduction plan that addresses the unique challenges faced by older women? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to assure the member that we are quite aware that this pandemic has typically affected single seniors, and many of those, given that they live longer, are single senior women. I want to assure her that we are working on this issue, and we have provided some supports already through measures such as the GST supplementary payment. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, older women represent a high proportion of residents in long-term care facilities. Having spent their lives caring for parents, children and often their partners, they find themselves needing care in nursing homes. Multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Canada have highlighted systemic gaps that senior and elderly women may face in such facilities, as well as the working conditions of the female-dominated ranks of nurses and personal support workers. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a federal strategy for long-term care homes that recognizes quality of life for residents and working conditions for the employees, ideally one that goes hand in hand with a poverty reduction plan and enhanced home and community care investments across the country? hon. We are obviously deeply saddened by the outbreaks that have been going on in long-term care facilities and those who have lost their lives. We do recognize that the administration of long-term care and palliative care is the responsibility of provinces and territories; however, we have been taking a team Canada approach, and as you already know, we've been doing tremendous work with them to try to ensure that those who live in those facilities can be well cared for and safe. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, from May 4 to May 10, we are observing Mental Health Week. We know that our essential workers right now are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety, on top of putting their own physical safety and health on the line. Most of these workers work in precarious jobs with no access to paid sick leave or vacation, and without any benefits to access mental health services. Apart from the very welcome investments in online resources, can the minister explain how the government will support these workers now and once the crisis is behind us? hon. I'm so glad that she's raising the issue of mental health and in particular how poor mental health is oftentimes connected to our socio-economic status. We do have new resources that are available to all Canadians free of charge through the Wellness Together portal, but there is more to do. I think the announcement of top-up wages, for example, which the Prime Minister spoke about today, is another example of how we're taking the health and wellness of all low-income Canadians very seriously. We know that mental health is not divorced from socio-economic status, and I look forward to working with her more on other measures that we can take together. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, we're all very aware of the importance of temporary foreign workers and their role in ensuring our food sovereignty across this country. How are we protecting them? Madam Chair, will the government take action to strengthen legislation and ensure Canadians have access to the food they need while the workers who help bring it to our tables have safe working conditions, regardless of where they are working in this country? hon. We are very concerned, as are countries around the world, that we support and create the environment for the health and safety of our temporary foreign workers and we value their contribution to our food supply chain here in Canada. We have issued guidelines to employers and are working very closely with local public health authorities in the provinces and territories to make sure workers are protected, that physical distancing and other recommendations are adhered to and that there are severe consequences if employers don't take care of their workers. alistair macgregor (cowichanmalahatlangford, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. My first question is this: Will the Liberal government prevent federal bailout funds from going to companies that use tax havens and avoid paying their fair share here in Canada, yes or no? hon. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): We are working to make sure that anyone who tries to circumvent the rules faces serious consequences. Anyone who abuses the program could face fines of up to 225% of the subsidy amount as well as five years in prison. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, I didn't really hear a yes to that question, so I'll repeat it. Does the government really think it's appropriate for tax-avoiding corporations to receive funding provided for by taxpayers? hon. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, the agriculture funding announced by the government earlier this week amounts to less than 10% of what the Canadian Federation of Agriculture estimates will be required to help farmers weather this crisis. I have to remind my colleague that we have put in $5 billion through FCC, $50 million for the temporary foreign workers, two times $50 million for pork and beef producers this week, and $77 million for food processing. This is only the beginning, and we should not forget that the business risk management programs are still there to offer support. alistair macgregor: Yes, Madam Chair, but we're nearly two months into this pandemic and this announcement only came this week. marie-claude bibeau: Madam Chair, we are working closely with the farmers and their representatives to identify where the gaps are, but once again, we have made improvements to the AgriStability program. They can get, depending on the province, either 50% or 75% in advance payments, and they can also, right now, access their AgriInvest program. There is more than $2 billion ready to access today, if they have the acting chair (mrs. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, federal disability recipients and seniors on fixed incomes have been hardest hit by cost of living increases from COVID-19. If we acknowledge that $2,000 per month is the minimum needed to get through this time, why are they being asked to survive on far less? When can they expect assistance, and how much will they receive? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to make sure people realize that we have provided some assistance through the GST supplementary benefit. We are also providing support to those who are still working, and we have done that by allowing them to access the CERB. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, as I think we've heard through today's question period, there are countless example of this government designing programs to exclude many small businesses that desperately need help. Whether it's the payroll requirements or other eligibility, we still, to this day, almost two months into the pandemic, have too many small businesses falling through the cracks. Madam Chair, why has the government taken this approach and when can we finally expect fixes to the whole system? hon. mary ng: Madam Chair, right from the get-go, we have been committed to making sure that Canadians are helped through this crisis, and that small businesses get the support that they need, so that we are saving businesses and jobs in this country. yves perron (berthiermaskinong, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I hear the questions my fellow members are asking, and to be frank, I don't find the answers satisfactory. It is well and good to talk about existing programs, but they aren't working, so enough with that refrain. This morning, both farmers and processors came together for a press conference at the Union des producteurs agricoles's head office in Longueuil. Can the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food therefore tell us when she will announce significant supports for the industry? hon. marie-claude bibeau: We have already announced significant amounts of support, and more is on the way. It's not that the programs aren't working; it's that they aren't generous enough in farmers' eyes. That's why I'm working with my provincial counterparts to make improvements to programming, including AgriStability. After using the online AgriStability benefit estimator, a pork producer found out that he would get $11 per head, as they say in the industry. Pork producers are calling for $20 per head, so it's a good start, even though it's not enough and it isn't what they are asking for. We want to keep working together, but farmers have to access the money available to them through AgriStability. Even before the crisis, we were hearing from people in the industry that the programs were neither suitable nor sufficient. A few days ago, the government announced $50million in funding for pork producers, even though they are asking for $20per hog for 27million hogs. When is the government going to announce a whole lot more in funding support? What's been announced so far is only 10% of what farmers are asking for. However, I would point out to the member that, when it comes to AgriRecovery, we made an exception to the rule. That's two funding envelopes of $50million each to help cover the additional costs from the decrease in plant processing capacity. As the Prime Minister said, we are going to do more, and we are moving forward step by step. yves perron: What we concluded in committee this week is that the $125million is not new money. The government can't say that programs already exist and, at the same time, claim that they are new programs. Everyone knows that the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement came into force a month earlier than planned, despite the promises that had been made. An easy way to make money available without committing new spending is to provide compensation and announce programs for supply-managed sectors that got nothing. It seems to me that a time of crisis is a time for the government to practise some judo and announce measures. I am reaching out to the government, as I always do, but it has to come forward with announcements. marie-claude bibeau: Our commitment to farmers in supply-managed sectorsmeaning, egg, poultry and dairy farmersis as strong as it always was. Support for poultry and egg farmers is in the form of investment programs, which aligns well with the recovery. At this time, we are focusing on emergency programs to help farmers hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. As you know, legislative changes are needed to grant the Canadian Dairy Commission's request and increase its borrowing limit by $200million so it can buy more butter and cheese. Chair, we're all inundated, as we've heard during this entire question period, with Canadians' concerns about the economic restrictions and the social restrictions that they're under. Over the last couple of months, the WHO has given one very consistent message in terms of coming out of those economic and social restrictions. Tedros said in his briefing, We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. On March 25, 44 days ago, he said, Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictionstheyre also the best way to prevent them. Does the minister agree with the WHO that relentless testing and tracing are critical to a successful economic and social relaunch strategy in Canada? hon. Absolutely, we agree that testing and contact tracing will form an important part of our response to living with COVID. We've been investing heavily in ensuring that we have the lab capacity, the collaboration across provinces and territories, and the variety of testing options to help us increase our capacity to test. We are aiming right now for a high volume of tests, but I will also say that in Canada we have one of the highest testing rates in the world. Although we're doing well, I can assure him that I am with him and I believe we need to do more. Chair, as I mentioned to his colleagues yesterday, we have currently the capacity to do approximately 60,000 tests per day across the country. Chair, it's hard for me to get that exact number, but I will get back to him with the exact number. She said, As a first tranche, roughly close to 60,000 is where the provinces can potentially expand to as a target already. Does the minister happen to know, ballpark, what the average number of daily tests in Canada has been since that statement? hon. patty hajdu: Your estimate was slightly higher than what my estimate was going to be, so that's a great piece of news. Listen, I will just say that I think if the premise here is that we could be doing more testing. I would agree, but I will also say that the provinces and territories are working incredibly hard on testing strategies that meet their own specific needs. Tam works with all the chief public health officers across the country to ensure that their testing strategy is going to be applicable and appropriate for their particular jurisdictions. mike lake: Following up on that, is there a jurisdiction in Canada where relentless testing is not the appropriate strategy as provinces consider relaunching? hon. For example, in British Columbia, where there are relatively fewer cases in general and less disease activity, they may have a different testing strategy than a province like Ontario, which is currently struggling with more outbreaks. mike lake: Given your comment that our current testing capability is 60,000, and acknowledging that only at one point in the entire history of our COVID response, over several months, has our weekly average been over 30,000it was about 31,000 for one day on a rolling basisMinister, are you satisfied with our current testing amounts right now, given that we're testing 50% of what the public health officer advises would be best? hon. patty hajdu: I'm so amazed by the work the provinces and territories have done in a very short time to increase their capacity. We are supporting them with the tools that they need to get more testing done, but also to have other components in place that will allow them to do the rapid tracing of positive cases. I think it's very important to remember that testing strategies will be different across the provinces, based on the outbreak disease epidemiology. Having said that, I know that we can all do better, and I'm certain that my counterparts feel the same"

        "Query": "What were Dr. Frank Atherton's thoughts on having a target, investment, data, addressing gaps in data, and legislation to build a healthy environment?",
        "Summary": "Dr Frank Atherton emphasizes the importance of having a target that is both achievable and challenging. He believes that a target is not only a tool, but also an evaluation to assess progress. However, there is still much work to be done. In terms of investment, Dr Frank Atherton mentions that they currently invest in various areas related to child health, including obesity. The estimated investment needed for their plan is around \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million per year. Additionally, Dr Frank Atherton suggests considering diverting some of the \u00a37 billion spent on health and social care towards prevention initiatives and tackling obesity. The latest data presented by Dr Frank Atherton shows that less than a third of children aged four or five are overweight or obese, but the situation is not improving. The data also reveals that about 12% of children are severely obese. Dr Frank Atherton highlights the importance of having a longitudinal view of children's health over time, which would require significant resources. He also supports the implementation of legislation to create a healthy environment, citing examples of food takeaways. Overall, Dr Frank Atherton's goal is to address the challenges of child health and obesity through targeted strategies and investments.",
        "Article": "We've received apologies for absence from Michelle Brown and Jack Sargeant; there are no substitutions. We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. If I can just start by asking about the fact that 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that it will deliver for children and young people. We have high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults\u2014we know that, and we can't walk away from that because that's translating into demand on health services. But we have to take a focus, a future generation's focus, almost, on the next generation. I don't write off the current generation, we can't afford to do that, but we do need to think about what can we do that would be different for the next generation so that they don't get into the sorts of problems that we're currently seeing with overweight and obesity. We know that the consequences of that for our young people are going to be enormous if we don't do something and something quite soon. We know that overweight children go on to become overweight adults, unfortunately, and that brings all the consequences of multiple disease issues\u2014diabetes is often cited\u2014cancer risk et cetera. So, we have to focus on children, and, in fact, during the consultation, we've been very clear that we need to engage with children and young people as well. Perhaps we'll get into that at some point, Chair, but, yes, I can give you that assurance. What my follow-up question, really, is: can you just tell us what kind of engagement you've had with children and young people to inform the draft strategy? dr frank atherton: Well, Nathan may be able to influence some of the detail, but in broad terms, we have discussed with young people in a number of fora. In fact, I was delighted that we had a young person, Evie Morgan, a schoolgirl from mid Wales, who came to the joint launch on the consultation. She met the Minister there and gave a very good personal account of her views on obesity and overweight. I'm visiting a school, either this week or next week, at Treorchy, to talk with teachers and young people there. nathan cook: I was going to say, we've also had a session with youth ambassadors as well, and what we've actually produced for the consultation is not just the children and young people's version, but also a toolkit in terms of getting schools really engaged and involved in terms of the work that we want them to do to feed into this as well. So, we've already had some really good responses from a lot of youth group and schools already. lynne neagle am: And you've got a structured programme, have you, to roll that out? Okay. We've got some questions now on leadership, and the first questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. The Minister for health said yesterday, in answering a question from me on the Chamber floor, that you gave him advice not to have a target in terms of reducing obesity among children. Could you confirm that that's what your advice was and tell us why you don't think that a target is needed? dr frank atherton: My advice was not that we don't need a target\u2014we may well need a target, and that's one of the issues we need to consult on\u2014but that the target that had been adopted in England and in Scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable, and that if we are to choose a target in Wales, then we need to balance deliverability with challenge. So, there is something about performance management, because I would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they're delivering on this, and I think we can use targets to that. But they are one tool in the box that I would think we could use, and part of the consultation is to ask that question\u2014'If we are to go down a route in Wales of choosing a target, what might that look like?' sian gwenllian am: Okay. dr frank atherton: It's certainly something that we could consider in terms of the final strategy. Well, that is contrary to what I was told yesterday on the floor of the Chamber by the Minister, but there we go. I'm glad to hear that you're not ruling out having a target, because without a target, without something to aim for, how do we know that we're getting there? dr frank atherton: I think your point about evaluation is really important. Whatever we produce at the end of this process\u2014and we're looking to produce a final strategy towards the autumn\u2014we do need to have a strong evaluation. So, some metrics in there, it would seem, would be appropriate, but what those are, what the nature of those are, do we frame them as targets or ambitions\u2014that's the point we need to consult on. If the Government is going to be successful in terms of the aim of reducing childhood obesity, then it needs to fund and support the actions. Have you made an assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan? dr frank atherton: Resourcing will be important. We currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally, and, of course, obesity and overweight in particular. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in Wales. A figure of \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest, but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes. Can we make them more effective? Can we get better value from them? And there may well be a case for new investment, and that's a question, of course, that would need to be discussed with Ministers when we're producing the final strategy. nathan cook: But I think a key consideration as well is we already know there is investment across health boards in some kind of obesity-related services. So, I think what we really need to think about across Wales is how we can drive greater scale, how we can look at current programmes in terms of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well. sian gwenllian am: And does the level of investment depend on what the target is\u2014what the goal is? dr frank atherton: I don't think you can necessarily just link the two. The issue of resourcing is one that's there irrespective of whether we choose to put a target in place. sian gwenllian am: But how would we know that it's being used effectively if there isn't something to aim for? dr frank atherton: Which brings you back to the question about evaluation. sian gwenllian am: Yes, but without a target, how can you properly evaluate? If you don't know what you're trying to do, how can you properly evaluate? Anyway, you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on soft drinks towards some of these efforts to\u2014? dr frank atherton: Well, of course, there are some consequentials that are coming to the Welsh Government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks. That funding, of course, is less than we had anticipated, and that reflects, actually, a success story because industry is reformulating, and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease, which is a good thing. I'm not personally in favour of hypothecation, I think I'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource. And when I think about obesity, I don't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the \u00a37 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general, and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular. Could you give us any kind of figure? dr frank atherton: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? sian gwenllian am: You say that there is less money that's come in through these consequentials from the levy, can you mention some sort of figure? dr frank atherton: The figure that I have in mind is about \u00a356 million that's coming in in terms of revenue over a two-year period. When the sugar levy was first brought in, there was some modelling at UK level about what level of revenue that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. nathan cook: Yes, I was going to say, there was a mid-year report done where the levy has raised \u00a3150 million to date since coming into force in April, and the original forecast was \u00a3520 million a year. So, I think that shows the amount of work that's been done by industry around reformulation. sian gwenllian am: And the consequentials of that? That is the consequential\u2014\u00a3150 million. sian gwenllian am: Yes, so what's the Welsh consequential? lynne neagle am: Fifty-six. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million. So, obviously, you know, we can be more ambitious because there is money in that pot if that money was ring-fenced for this particular scheme. dr frank atherton: Well, the resource is going to be a real issue that we need to address, and I think as Nathan has said, there is funding of various initiatives currently in the system, and we need to look at that and make that as effective as possible. Will there be a need for some additional resource? There may well be, and that's a question that we'll have to look at in terms of the strategy when we develop it and have a discussion with Ministers about the level of resourcing. lynne neagle am: Can I just ask on that before Si\u00e2n moves on? What assessment have you made of how that money is being spent in other UK nations? Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to\u2014? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that? dr frank atherton: I'm not sure I understand your point, Chair, in terms of the link between the consequentials from\u2014. Are you talking about the consequentials from the sugar levy or are you talking about\u2014? lynne neagle am: Yes, because in other nations, it is being used to directly impact on initiatives to tackle obesity, whereas, we've kind of put it here in Wales into the general pot and it's being used to fund a plethora of different things. My preference\u2014it's a personal view\u2014is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. , what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention. lynne neagle am: No, I recognise that, and I think we're talking about additional resource. suzy davies am: I was just wondering whether you thought that there was a useful psychological link on the part of the public between saying, 'Here's a sugar levy', and 'It's going to be used to help children and adults stay healthier.' Going into a pot, it actually makes it quite difficult to explain the purpose of the tax in the first place. So, I take your overall point, but in terms of the people who we're trying to help in all this, actually creating a direct link might be quite helpful. You're putting an emphasis on the whole-system approach in implementing the plan, how are you going to create a system that co-ordinates action and drives change across relevant partners, avoiding a situation where it's everyone's role, but nobody's responsibility? How are you going to avoid that? dr frank atherton: It's a very important question, and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that, around leadership and drive nationally. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down. And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important. But I'd like to see\u2014and I know I'm a public health professional, so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system; but I would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well. So I'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this. So, we'll need some sort of national oversight, absolutely, but we need local ownership and local leadership, too. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister? dr frank atherton: Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as\u2014I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government. janet finch-saunders am: I know my colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives? dr frank atherton: Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: Could I just ask\u2014sorry to interrupt\u2014how up to date is that? dr frank atherton: The last survey was just last year. dr frank atherton: So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows\u2014. It's not getting radically worse\u2014there's always statistical variation in these things\u2014but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way. Does that answer your question? janet finch-saunders am: Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed? dr frank atherton: Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that  in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier. nathan cook: And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful. lynne neagle am: Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data? dr frank atherton: I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years\u2014what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,\u00a0 but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation? dr frank atherton: It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland\u00a0to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got\u2014we need to deploy them all. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that? dr frank atherton: I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. I think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively.\u00a0I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around? dr frank atherton: Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would\u2014it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue. Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity.\u00a0I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pinning that down a little bit? Because this is education, not health, and\u2014. dr frank atherton: Well, look, I've got to confess to you, I'm not an educationist, and so the question on staffing numbers in schools is not one that I have been asked to give a deal of consideration to, and it hasn't really been discussed, I don't believe, in the context of development of the strategy. If there is a specific point around that that the committee would like to make in terms of a response into the consultation, which I presume you'll be making, then we'd be happy to consider that. We have standards and we perhaps need to think about how we tighten those standards and how we\u2014enforce isn't the right word, but how we implement and make sure that those standards are properly implemented, because you're absolutely right to say that habits are developed early in life. That's in the preschool; it's also in the home of course, and then later in the school. So, we do need to look at all of those as settings and are there more things we can do within those settings to drive healthier behaviours\u2014that's exactly why we need the consultation. nathan cook: But I would say, through that scheme as well, we've really got a really good bank of preschools that are actually doing some really great work in this area as well. So, I think the more we can understand the successes that some of those environments are having\u2014you know, how we can roll those out and work across other settings to create that wider impact as well is going to be really important. What I'm thinking about is expectations at that level will be expectations at a slightly older level, which will be contained within the foundation phase. And while you're quite right\u2014obviously, parents have a role in this, or families\u2014there will be, particularly with the introduction of the new curriculum, certain expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children and things. And that's why I asked you about local leadership, because, if it fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the plan at foundation phase, it's going to fail further up the school years as well. I think it might be something that the board might want to consider here, because at some point there'll be an accountability question and we will want to know how 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' fits in with the new plans for the new curriculum, and whether it's merely persuasive and influential or whether it has the weight to place some obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools. So, this connection, I think, is quite an important one, and, if the strategy development board could consider that, I think it would be very helpful, because this doesn't exist in a vacuum. dr frank atherton: Well, I'd certainly be delighted to\u00a0take that back and we can look at it in terms of how we move from the consultation into the final strategy. suzy davies am: Because we will want to know who to ask: 'you're the accountable person\u2014why has something worked, or not worked?' We will need to know that at some point. dr frank atherton: Just building on Nathan's point, some of the schools\u2014I know it's schools rather than the preschools, and I take your point, but some of the schools we've been working with have absolutely brilliant models of good practice and good local leadership. I remember the Minister actually at the launch, and one of the schools was represented there, and they presented\u2014the school came and some of the children came and presented\u2014to the whole audience about the activities that they were undertaking in their school around physical activity and on healthy eating, and it was such a model of good behaviour the question was, 'Well, why not everywhere?', so that probably speaks to your question. lynne neagle am: And have you had any discussions, then, with education officials around things like teacher training and CPD, because you'll be aware the Health and Social Care Committee has made a number of recommendations in this area? It's crucial that we skill up the staff to develop these things in an appropriate way, isn't it? dr frank atherton: Well, we certainly discuss with education colleagues in Welsh Government. There's more we need to do in terms of that, because you're absolutely right: there's something about building the whole of the workforce\u2014education is really important, but elsewhere as well; it's about how do we really make every contact count, you know, that construct. So, everybody who's working in the health and social care system should have a role in this; everybody who works in education, whether it's the old\u2014. Do we still have dinner ladies? Or teachers, you know, they have a role to play in supporting children to be as healthy as they possibly can. And, actually, I see them, Chair, as a really essential part of the public health workforce. Suzy, are you going to do your curriculum one? suzy davies am: Well, I've bound it in together, but that final point you make about teachers being part of the answer to this, they're already under a range of pressures: is it fair to make them accountable for whether this works or not? Or should that local leadership lie somewhere else? I don't expect you to pin down a person today. dr frank atherton: I wouldn't like to blame a teacher or performance manage them on the proportion of their children in their class who are overweight. That would clearly be nonsense, wouldn't it? But they are part of the solution, and so the accountability lies further up the chain, doesn't it? The question I think we would have, and public services boards might well ask, and the local education authorities may well ask, is: how effective is any particular school at driving forwards these healthy behaviours? suzy davies am: Okay, thank you. hefin david am: Is that all right, Chair? lynne neagle am: You've got the floor, Hefin. What would that look like? dr frank atherton: Just in terms of the physical activity, I have to say it's a really important dimension and we need to move further on. We know not enough of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It does have an impact on healthy weight, but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation, in terms of mental health issues, et cetera, you know. nathan cook: I'd just say that one thing we have got in train is, obviously, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales\u2014we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently. So, one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we're already delivering as well. hefin david am: With that in mind, I'm going to confess to you, chief medical officer, I did anything in school I could to avoid physical education lessons. Yet, two weeks ago, I played for the Assembly rugby team\u2014I wanted to get that in. How can we get children more engaged with physical education in ways that\u2014? I felt completely alienated in school. dr frank atherton: Well, you're right, and many people go through that same journey and come to physical activity later in life, and that's great if they do that. The sad reality is that many people don't, and we also know that there are issues around the dropping off, particularly for girls, of physical activity towards the teenage years. , at the heart of it, it's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people. Sometimes that's easier, I sense, for boys than for girls, but we need to tailor things to different audiences. hefin david am: Yes, that's the trick, isn't it? It's about finding out what children enjoy doing. It's not just about elite sports; it's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity. hefin david am: So, do you think, with that in mind, we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education? dr frank atherton: Again, I'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance. And finally, with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools, do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils? dr frank atherton: I don't have a personal view on that. I think it's the quality of the food that kids are getting, whether that comes from home or through school, and whether it's free or whether it's paid for. The question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level. I think that's a\u2014 hefin david am: So, you think that's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet. dr frank atherton: I think it's important that children have access to food, absolutely, if that's your question, but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what's in that food offer. I've been around some amazing schools in my own constituency, where they've got proper canteen facilities for pupils and really, really good produce in the meals. And, to be honest, I've been very surprised and shocked at what I've seen of the quality of the food in the packed lunches. Nobody can really police, and I wouldn't want to see parents being policed over what goes in a packed lunch, so if there is data out there to suggest that there's a larger percentage of parents providing packed lunched that are really not good at all, then there is some merit to be said for what Hefin is\u2014. Would you be willing to carry out any research? dr frank atherton: So, your point about food that's brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a route of guidance and prohibition, but that gets you into the role of nanny in chief and I don't really see that as my role or Government's role, and I don't think it's effective either. Do you remember\u2014? You must have seen on tv\u2014I think it was in Scotland; I don't know if it's happened in Wales\u2014parents pushing the fish and chip packets through the school railings. What I have seen, though, is some really good innovative practice in schools where, for example, they reward children for bringing the healthy options. Schools can give guidance to parents about what would be a healthy lunch and what sort of things might be expected to be seen in the lunch box. So, I've seen some of those approaches that have transformed, actually, the offer of what comes in school boxes. So, my point to the question was: isn't there some merit, perhaps, about all children being equal and eating similar good-quality food in schools? dr frank atherton: Yes. The draft plan commits, doesn't it, to updating the healthy eating in schools regulations\u2014the 2013 regulations? I appreciate this is a consultation, but what is it that needs changing in those regulations at the moment, just to give us a bit of steer? nathan cook: It's mainly on sugar content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is, you know, what we need to be careful of is unintended consequences of changing that, as well, if you see a shift to more kids bringing in school packed lunches as well. So, I think we want to consider the best way of doing that and consider through the consultation how we can go about it. janet finch-saunders am: The 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' plan commits to a review of the clinical obesity pathway. What are the time frames for this review, and what do you think are the basic essentials of a clinical obesity pathway for children and young people? dr frank atherton: We do have a pathway for managing overweight, and that's been in place since about 2010, I believe, and we do need to bring that up to date in terms of current knowledge and experiences. We've challenged Public Health Wales; we've asked Public Health Wales to undertake a review of that pathway, and they are going through that process now. nathan cook: We were asking them to review the pathway before we launch the final strategy in October because, obviously, what we want is for that to inform what that final strategy looks like. dr frank atherton: The second point of your question about what are the essential elements, they are already there; we need to tweak them and we need to make sure that they're properly delivered. But it's a tiered approach, so, having access to information through schools and through communities and into families is part of the first step of that. And then, if children are overweight, it's a question about how they're identified. There are questions about the ability of the public to recognise large children, so there may be an issue there. But when children are running into issues around weight, what kind of interventions can be put in, either through primary care or through communities through health visitors, et cetera? And then of course we do have\u2014and we've started to shine a light on this, haven't we\u2014the very overweight children. I don't think we have enough in the way of targeted support to be able to support those. So, I think there's something about looking at our whole pathway, mapping out what the current evidence now shows us is needed, and then thinking about what is our provision in Wales and what do we need to do to bring that up to the level of the places that are the best. The draft plan recognises the importance of the first 1,000 days, but it doesn't appear to include any new proposals to help parents to enable lifestyle changes. Are you satisfied that the draft plan does enough to address the influence that family and parents have on children's healthy weight behaviours, particularly in the first 1,000 days? dr frank atherton: Well, the first 1,000 days are really critically in shaping lives, as I'm sure you'd agree. We are absolutely open to any other suggestions that the public or this committee have as to what more we can and should do. There are a number of things, the sorts of programmes you've mentioned, that I think could be more effective. We know that children who are breastfed are less likely to suffer from obesity in childhood and, indeed, to go on to be obese adults. If there are other interventions in other areas that we need to take, then we'd be delighted to hear what they are, but those are the ones that have jumped out so far. nathan cook: Can I just say\u2014? One of the proposals we're looking for is, obviously, we know that during pregnancy it's a really critical time when we can actually look to work with mothers. We know from looking at some of the behaviour change that it's actually a really critical point when new mothers really start thinking about their lives, wanting the best for their child and their families. So, what we are thinking about is how we could develop some kind of approaches to that going forward. But we know our Healthy Start scheme is also a good lever for us, just in terms of how we can look to improve that kind of dietary offer at the earliest stage as well. Finally, we know that for some families day-to-day challenges can make it difficult for them to make healthy choices, particularly for those on lower incomes and/or maybe using food banks. Could the Welsh Government take bolder action to better support low-income families to eat healthily? dr frank atherton: Well, you've touched on a really important point about inequalities because overweight and obesity is not evenly distributed across our population. It absolutely is more prevalent in more socioeconomically deprived communities, and that's something that should really concern us all. So, it gets you to questions of availability of fresh food and produce; it gets you to questions of formulation of products and whether value brands are less healthy than more premium brands. So, it cuts across all of those issues that we talked about in terms of settings and in terms of environment earlier. We do need to think in broad terms\u2014broader terms than just obesity, but we do need to think in broad terms\u2014about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets you to really important questions about the minimum wage and income poverty. There's no doubt in my mind\u2014I'm a public health professional\u2014and there's no doubt in my mind that economic success and health success go hand in hand. In terms of what we can do through this particular consultation, there are some things in there about providing better access, but without tackling some of those deeper determinants of health, their impact will necessarily be limited. lynne neagle am: Just finally from me, then, you referred earlier to the importance of making every contact count, but some stakeholders have told the committee that they struggle to do that because of difficulties in availability of people to refer to. Is that a situation that you recognise and what, really, can we do to improve that situation? dr frank atherton: Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. What we're seeing across the NHS is a gradual transformation in primary care so that primary care is no longer about going to see your GP, it's about going to see a practice where you have a range of health professionals. Would I like to see more dietetic support, for example, in that setting? Absolutely I would. I think we need to think in terms of that pathway that we were talking about earlier, about access to that kind of advice and support, which can head off people getting into problems and kids getting into problems with weight issues. So, that question of redesign of the pathway really speaks to, I think, your point about, 'Well, where do people go when they have problems with their weight?' That's true for adults and it's true for children as well. Well, can I thank you both very much for your attendance? It's been a really productive session. Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the committee, because getting some input into the consultation from children's perspectives, this would be one of the routes we would absolutely welcome.

        "Summary": "The two groups, the young and trendy and the old and rich, had different preferences for their clothing and products. The young and trendy group preferred a fruit and vegetable theme with a spongy material, while the old and rich group preferred dark colors, simple shapes, and familiar materials like wood. Interestingly, the marketing team found that the trend of incorporating fruit and vegetable themes was widespread across various areas, from clothing to furniture. People seemed to prefer natural and round designs over futuristic ones with sharp angles and titanium.",
        "Article": " , first I'll  I'll  discuss the buttons we just chose ,  show you some samples ,   discuss some colours and design maybe , already . The channels buttons , one to nine , and  off   zero to nine , and the  button to choose  higher channels than nine .  the volume and channel quadrants ,  left and right , up and down arrows , to  do the volume and channel . industrial designer: user interface: well  what's pretty standard is  that it's that they're all pretty   high  marketing: Large . project manager: user interface: So it's it's not really very  clear what's the function of that . So , that's project manager: Can you go back one page ? For the  menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu . But  user interface: So ,  how project manager: You have to put it on the user interface: Like this . user interface: well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next  meeting . industrial designer: user interface: But  , as we have to  to to design the the case and the whole  remote control in our  our our corporate  company   colours and the logo , I would  recommend a yellow case . user interface: yeah so good  good icons on the buttons , and  and big buttons is my  personal  opinion . marketing: project manager: industrial designer: at first we will  I will f  say something about what younger people want , marketing: Okay . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about  what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . Maybe it's nice to  get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and  flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use or something like that . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs  of all the things for the remote control . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next ,  if you wanna see that channel . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here .  , but then we have just a basic   remote control , and I think there are a lot of those  things , and people won't buy it any more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it's also then  thoughtful if we u  use  as  different kind of  shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . But , thi i  This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , industrial designer: Not with an L_C_D_ . industrial designer: but l when you see a menu  on the television , it's like you see  one to twenty , you go   s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . marketing: can you give an indication in b  in the cost difference between  the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? industrial designer: I got it on my screen and it was  higher . marketing: I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . marketing: And that might  bring back the costs  industrial designer: But then we'll I think we must discuss who  what will be better . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ . So , well how we did do that ?  , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . And well ,  what did you find ?  , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they  they starting to like  fruit and vegetables  as a theme for n  clothes , shoes , and also  products . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . How w how we how we make it ?  project manager: Yes , a concept on  industrial designer: marketing: project manager: Just industrial designer: Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all marketing: Yeah .  , what do we want ? industrial designer: Yeah , but if I paint with project manager: I'll paint . marketing: We have this , and we had the idea of an  a more    like sh in the shape of your hand . user interface: industrial designer: M like Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it . user interface: marketing: A g project manager: So , it has to be soft ? marketing:  . And  , the buttons ? industrial designer: So , you can squeeze in it and Sorry ? project manager: Buttons . industrial designer: user interface: But but i that's the only scroll  button on it then ? industrial designer: But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . marketing: And i if we go to  industrial designer: If  'Kay c If we do If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back user interface:  . project manager: It's better in marketing: If we have a menu ,  how do we  choose other options ? industrial designer: with the menu  button . Just not like all the other ones , with  this thing , and  here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . project manager: But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . project manager: Yeah , but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? industrial designer: user interface: project manager: You don't know . It's like some sort of  teletext option , but we don't have teletext . industrial designer: And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will  be much higher . industrial designer: And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . user interface: industrial designer: Paint it ? marketing: user interface: industrial designer: With the scroll thing on , like this ? project manager: One with two scroll buttons and one with without . industrial designer: So ? project manager: And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ . user interface: But if you put push the the menu button project manager: that's the menu . user interface: Yeah , wh what Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . marketing: industrial designer: But is it easy to use ? When you have it on your left side , and project manager: When it's not too big . marketing: M  yeah , maybe it's better if the  scroll-wheels are  industrial designer: Separate , more separate , h yeah . But would it be easy to use then ? If it's like you have a big  project manager: industrial designer: project manager: Very good . marketing: But ,  industrial designer: Personally , I think two scroll buttons  aren't easy to handle . industrial designer: No project manager: Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down . But is it  Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop . industrial designer: A small one like this , like a Nintendo  k project manager: No just like in a industrial designer: Playstation thing . project manager: Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can industrial designer: Just like a Playstation thing . project manager: So Maybe , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . industrial designer: No , that's okay , I got marketing: And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ?  , it costs extra ? industrial designer:  they're not  in details . project manager: industrial designer: It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? project manager: Yeah we I think you get it . industrial designer: And that's project manager: And  , we If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to industrial designer:  the most expensive . So ,  the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and But , it has to be small . industrial designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ? project manager: If you have pistol , it L_C_D_'s not easy . industrial designer: If you have a joystick on No , if you have like  an   a ni a  Playstation  game controller . But ,  the easy of user interface: But that's marketing: th the ease of use wasn't  the most important  aspect of it . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: So marketing: project manager: I think it's clear <doc-sep>project manager: So  I will again do the secretary part  we will have three presentation first   the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . project manager:   we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . project manager: So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the  first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use  what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And at the end  Sammy will give  a trend watching on what he's he's been doing . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or  and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ marketing: Ah . industrial designer: and then  titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . So , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . Still we are looking for possible  technical  specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic  to have enough energy with the solar cells marketing: And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . user interface: Why ? industrial designer:  it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser  re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ marketing: industrial designer: which are  which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , user interface: industrial designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition marketing: industrial designer: we want to reduce  cost . project manager:  I want to know why it b  just  sorry but for the point before  why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . industrial designer:   And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things project manager: Okay . user interface: W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like industrial designer: Yeah . marketing:  like this ? project manager: Yes so  user interface: to make it feel better and to you know industrial designer: Like in cell phones recently project manager: -huh . industrial designer: And this push buttons project manager:  yeah so industrial designer: we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo  we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money project manager: Okay , s so simple button and  speech recognition for the more complicated . industrial designer: for S S marketing: Speech industrial designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , user interface: user interface: Okay , and still we have industrial designer: so user interface:  can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? marketing: L_C_D_ . industrial designer:  l marketing: Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button . industrial designer: So  user interface: No , industrial designer: it's like a user interface: it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . industrial designer: Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and user interface: Okay , so let's try it , let's t industrial designer: because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display marketing: The L_C_D_ would industrial designer: or this inter marketing: The display would only be display and not  touch sensitive you mean . user interface: Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad ,  just a display for giving you information . Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries marketing: Okay . marketing: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just  the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask . industrial designer: Yeah , that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to   how to define our re speech recognition marketing: If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology project manager: Okay , industrial designer: and so project manager: for the location . industrial designer: Yeah , if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . So let's now go to the you don't have more question ? industrial designer: marketing: No , it's okay . user interface: But still  L_S_D_'s already quite nice , marketing: L_C_D_ . user interface: L_C_ marketing: L_S_D_ is something else , industrial designer: marketing: and it's quite nice as well . user interface:    have a look at this project manager: industrial designer: user interface: no it's yeah . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and  all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons marketing: user interface: and  we got explanation for every button industrial designer: user interface: and you can use your time and  it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and  the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and  go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and  power on and off  I I don't remember project manager:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: so  it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no ? I can see nothing . industrial designer: user interface: And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . marketing: Do you think it can come in several colours ? user interface: And everyone's gonna be satisfied . marketing: Or did the user interface: I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . marketing: Yeah , well they like  something which is  user interface: Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . marketing:  yeah , okay , user interface: Do you like it ? marketing: so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone , project manager: industrial designer: But it's  marketing: but I don't use that but again ,  I might user interface: That's why you don't have it . marketing: bu but project manager: industrial designer: But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ . industrial designer: Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this  the shapes and they can have different assembly . industrial designer: So users have different  they have their own interests , colour interests and so project manager: So ? user interface: project manager: you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_ , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Okay , what  there's one more decisi  one more solution in fact ,  'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , industrial designer: Lights , yeah . project manager: But  it can be in  maybe in an a gradable version , user interface: - , - , project manager: but industrial designer: Yeah . Those for which the remote control is  is to be  something useful  I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that  is  specific to them so it it's like a signature . project manager: Okay marketing: project manager: and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of  o or this is industrial designer: marketing: I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . project manager: so i it's not  a s base service industrial designer:  marketing: No  no . industrial designer: But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can those marketing: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . project manager: maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . user interface: Anyone has their remote controls here ? marketing: Oh , you don't ? Yeah . You don't have your remo user interface: No ? industrial designer: marketing: Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . marketing: It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like user interface: Okay . marketing: just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . Hand light , marketing:  glow in the dark , industrial designer: project manager: user interface: yeah . industrial designer: Yeah marketing: so industrial designer: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something marketing: user interface: user interface: but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? project manager: user interface: And  industrial designer: user interface: I dunno marketing: user interface: that's a question to you and to  to marketing: Well so I heard that  it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done  so that's the smartness of the thing . marketing: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or  beer cans with speech recognition industrial designer: marketing: but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . Are are you saying here that  the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want . industrial designer:  that  that could be feasible I guess , like So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition  so we can use marketing: Okay . marketing: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other   particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of  channels you are u more often using and  levels of volumes that you're more often  things like that industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: but industrial designer:  it's marketing: that might also be a good sales pitch again . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and  I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so  simple you might think that it's easy but  it's not so simple . Anyway these days  the best  source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at  what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day  or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . This is more risky because you're not following the trend , project manager: marketing: you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business .  to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but  basically there are  in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , industrial designer: marketing: it has to be new with some of  new  technology inside and  and this is also  more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see  it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of   that i  they can be id identified with  and and then  something that  contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . If we look back and not  look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have  a fruit and vegetable  way of of look or feel project manager: industrial designer: marketing: or so . And  if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , industrial designer:  . Well project manager: industrial designer: Yeah marketing: this so so I think   i industrial designer: kind of  maybe marketing: When we were talking about rubber , industrial designer: Yeah it marketing: I think  the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . marketing: So project manager: It seems to be marketing: Think more of  something in the colours of  like fruit and vegetables and spongy , industrial designer: Fruit . Even shape ? marketing: as a even in the shape it has to be more round and  more   look natural somehow . marketing: So that's what people seem to yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought project manager: Sorry . industrial designer: marketing: but that's that's fashion and project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Okay . project manager:  you have questions ? industrial designer: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it's marketing: These I'm sorry . industrial designer: This you you so did you marketing: Yeah , yeah we have people   listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , industrial designer: Where ? Oh . marketing: as you know our company is quite big and  so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask  their  friends industrial designer: It's not from  . marketing: The what we industrial designer: Yeah but some materials n they're to be  they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy marketing: Sure . marketing: We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables industrial designer: yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's marketing: but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course . We can have t colours or this shape marketing: Yeah , I think in the colours and in the  the kind of material . industrial designer: or at least marketing: If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good .  now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama  wil design , industrial designer: Look and feel de project manager:  Mark the user interface design , and  Sammy  the product evaluation . industrial designer: So , can we highlight the specific features of our project manager: Yeah you're right , you have to industrial designer: yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , project manager: So industrial designer: that's project manager: you say s industrial designer: we want to follow general trend . industrial designer: So , do you think marketing: No , we don't have to , user interface: So we have to  for project manager: No . marketing: industrial designer: So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like They more want these fancy features marketing:  I think i industrial designer: like marketing: yeah i it's again in this  what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us project manager: Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy  fruity-like marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer:  yeah at least like we can make banana or project manager: Don't you say that you cannot do double shape  curved shape user interface: But Doub double-curved . industrial designer: and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive user interface: Okay , okay . industrial designer: we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or user interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or project manager:  I think it's what we say , that we have an  an L_C_D_ with  information . marketing: The thing is that  if we want to have as he says if we want to have  a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . industrial designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: yeah yeah j yeah , marketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent  the wheel . marketing: Anyway it's very in general I think people  change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control "

Does anybody know ? marketing: Oh , another one . project manager: I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens . project manager: So is the agenda ? Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . project manager: Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting . Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . So are we supposed to bring the little things for the project manager: Yeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on clip marketing: project manager: do you have a belt ? industrial designer:  . So my favourite animal project manager: Yeah , what's your favourite animal ? industrial designer: 'Kay  marketing: Ah . project manager: 'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal . project manager: Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ? user interface: Aesthetic yep , sure . Can I just draw the face ? project manager:  yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . project manager: Okay , do y do you wanna do some write marketing: Why ? project manager: you wanna just write some words about it ? marketing: Because  cuddly . And they can feel when a human's got problems so project manager: Wow , so they're kinda spiritual . project manager: but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little marketing: industrial designer: Oh that's a project manager: no user interface: industrial designer: user interface: A prairie dog ? project manager: no  user interface: Oh a squirrel ? project manager: That's exactly what it is . project manager: Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute and stupid . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . user interface: So I think before we close  , we are expected  the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . user interface: Yeah , I think we're  before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for project manager: Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or user interface: Yeah . project manager: I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but user interface: Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . industrial designer: Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? marketing: Yeah . Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and marketing: Medium . Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , you want you want one remote that maybe can work  all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , project manager: Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . user interface: but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . project manager: 'Cause I I  I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , marketing: project manager: but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . industrial designer: But how do we know how much  , how much do we have per how much ? marketing: Twelve fifty . industrial designer: So do we have to be realistic within the budget or project manager: Well at the moment we could , wa  we industrial designer: Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . marketing: Guess project manager: 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . marketing: Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? Like so you have one in like  industrial designer: Yeah . And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and  into one basically . industrial designer:  have  one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one  a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . user interface: I'm not sure if that's like industrial designer: Or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button . user interface: I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . industrial designer: No , but you would slide it into  someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but user interface: Oh . project manager: F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . user interface: I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have .  so  we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , be able to operate project manager: Yeah . project manager: I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that  we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . project manager: What do you reckon ? See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make . Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be  project manager: I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . user interface: have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , project manager: Yeah . user interface:  simple to use , and looks decent and project manager: May w you know , maybe even marketing: But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? project manager: Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people marketing:  if it's if it's just like project manager: or so people that  b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for user interface: Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , project manager: Yeah . Yeah , rathe rather than focus on project manager: Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should user interface: Y Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r user interface: Yeah .  obviously everyone we're  you know  sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's user interface: Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . industrial designer: marketing: I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . project manager: Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah . user interface: Yeah , that's true what you were saying ,  it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not  not usable when you don't want it to be usable . marketing: project manager: so we've got some ideas , we've got  user interface: I guess that's good good for now . marketing: W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? project manager: Industrial Designer  which is marketing: Ah ri okay . project manager: that's you , so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . project manager: Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so ,  whether it's what goes into the box , somehow . Har how it works an project manager: And in marketing industrial designer: Bu marketing: These are requirement specification . marketing: So what the user requires project manager: Yeah , what industrial designer: Do you think our two kind of overlap , because marketing: in a remote . project manager: You two you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together . project manager: You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: So , do we take these off ? industrial designer: I don't {disfmarker}"

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on spectral subtraction and the opinions of the professor and PhD F.",
        "Summary": "The team explored different approaches for spectral subtraction, including both scaling and GGT bins. Each approach had its pros and cons. The professor suggested a simple spectral subtraction followed by a KL transformation. Additionally, he recommended using JRASTRA's technique, which involved adding noise to eliminate noise. The team also discussed VTS techniques. Initially, the professor did not see the advantage of combining the Wiener filter and the subspace, but later realized that a simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform and a Wiener filter, would suffice. The log magnitude spectral subtraction utilized twelve seconds from the past and future to calculate the mean. The use of a short window did not significantly impact the model's performance, which was desirable. The team also removed silence to enhance the model's effectiveness, drawing a parallel to caching utterances. PhD F shared that the preliminary results from spectral subtraction were unsatisfactory, but mean normalization helped reduce noise. However, mean and variance normalization only improved speech, not noise variance.",
        "Article": "professor c: And  Hans -  , Hans - Guenter will be here , I think by next next Tuesday or so . professor c: So he 's he 's going to be here for about three weeks , phd b: Oh ! That 's nice . professor c: So he 's gonna look in on everything we 're doing phd d:   grad e: Th - that 's his spectral subtraction group ? professor c: Yeah , grad e: Is that right ? professor c: yeah . He 's , very , very , easygoing , easy to talk to , and , very interested in everything . professor c: he 's he 's he 's he 's phd a: Wh - Back when I was a grad student he was here for a ,  a year or n six months .  , I went around and talked to everybody , and it seemed like they they had some new results but rather than them coming up and telling me I figured we should just wait a week and they can tell both you know , all of us . So , why don't we why don't we start with you , Dave , and then , we can go on . grad e: So , since we 're looking at putting this ,  mean log m magnitude spectral subtraction , into the SmartKom system , I I did a test seeing if , it would work using past only and plus the present to calculate the mean . So , I did a test , where I used twelve seconds from the past and the present frame to , calculate the mean . And phd a: Twelve seconds Twelve twelve seconds back from the current frame , is that what you mean ? grad e:  Twelve seconds , counting back from the end of the current frame , phd a: OK , OK . So it was , twen I think it was twenty - one frames and that worked out to about twelve seconds . grad e: And compared to , do using a twelve second centered window , I think there was a drop in performance but it was just a slight drop . grad e: Is is that right ? professor c: yeah , it was pretty it was pretty tiny . And , that that  , that 's encouraging for for the idea of using it in an interactive system like And , another issue I 'm I 'm thinking about is in the SmartKom system . So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ? And ,  So I w bef before ,  Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , here , I was curious , what if I trained the models using twelve seconds but I f I gave it a situation where the test set I was subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , I th I think it was , four se I think I think it was , something like four seconds and , six seconds , and eight seconds . And it seems like it it it hurts compared to if you actually train the models using th that same length of time but it it doesn't hurt that much .  , u usually less than point five percent , although I think I did see one where it was a point eight percent or so rise in word error rate . But this is , w where , even if I train on the , model , and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test , it the word error rate is around , ten percent or nine percent . professor c: But it but looking at it the other way , isn't it what you 're saying that it didn't help you to have the longer time for training , if you were going to have a short time for grad e: That that 's true .  , professor c: why would you do it , if you knew that you were going to have short windows in testing . grad e: Wa phd a: Yeah , it seems like for your  , in normal situations you would never get twelve seconds of speech , right ? I 'm not e u phd b: You need twelve seconds in the past to estimate , right ? Or l or you 're looking at six sec seconds in future and six in professor c: Yeah . phd a: Is this twelve seconds of  , regardless of speech or silence ? Or twelve seconds of speech ? grad e: Of of speech . professor c: The other thing , which maybe relates a little bit to something else we 've talked about in terms of windowing and so on is , that , I wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in you used two seconds , and when you were four seconds in , you used four seconds , and when you were six and you basically build up to the twelve seconds . grad e: But s so I g So I guess the que the question I was trying to get at with those experiments is , \" does it matter what models you use ? Does it matter how much time y you use to calculate the mean when you were , tra doing the training data ? \" professor c: Right . But  the other thing is that that 's  , the other way of looking at this , going back to , mean cepstral subtraction versus RASTA kind of things , is that you could look at mean cepstral subtraction , especially the way you 're doing it , as being a kind of filter . You know , basically you 're you 're you 're doing a high - pass filter or a band - pass filter of some sort and and just design a filter . And then , you know , a filter will have a certain behavior and you loo can look at the start up behavior when you start up with nothing . professor c: And and , you know , it will , if you have an IIR filter for instance , it will , not behave in the steady - state way that you would like it to behave until you get a long enough period , but , by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only a subtraction of the mean , you 're kind of , you know , tying your hands behind your back because there 's filters have all sorts of be temporal and spectral behaviors . professor c: And the only thing , you know , consistent that we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency component . phd b: But do you really want to calculate the mean ? And you neglect all the silence regions or you just use everything that 's twelve seconds , and grad e: you do you mean in my tests so far ? phd b: Ye - yeah . grad e: th  , yeah , I guess it 's something I need to play with more to decide how to set that up for the SmartKom system . Like , may maybe if I trained on six seconds it would work better when I only had two seconds or four seconds , and professor c: Yeah . professor c: Yeah , and again , if you take this filtering perspective and if you essentially have it build up over time .  , if you computed means over two and then over four , and over six , essentially what you 're getting at is a kind of , ramp up of a filter anyway . But , if you do that , then , in practice somebody using the SmartKom system , one would think if they 're using it for a while , it means that their first utterance , instead of , you know , getting , a forty percent error rate reduction , they 'll get a  , over what , you 'd get without this , policy , you get thirty percent . And then the second utterance that you give , they get the full you know , full benefit of it if it 's this ongoing thing . phd a: Oh , so you you cache the utterances ? That 's how you get your ,  professor c: Well , I 'm saying in practice , yeah , grad e: M phd a: Ah . professor c: that 's If somebody 's using a system to ask for directions or something , phd a: OK . And and to begin with if it doesn't get them quite right , ma m maybe they 'll come back and say , \" excuse me ? \" phd a:   And so , there 's a higher probability of it making an error , in the first utterance . phd a: What would be really cool is if you could have  , this probably users would never like this but if you had could have a system where , before they began to use it they had to introduce themselves , verbally . professor c: Oh , the other thing I guess which which , I don't know much about as much as I should about the rest of the system but but , couldn't you , if you if you sort of did a first pass I don't know what kind of , capability we have at the moment for for doing second passes on on , some kind of little small lattice , or a graph , or confusion network , or something . But if you did first pass with , the with either without the mean sub subtraction or with a a very short time one , and then , once you , actually had the whole utterance in , if you did , the , longer time version then , based on everything that you had , and then at that point only used it to distinguish between , you know , top N , possible utterances or something , you you might it might not take very much time .  , I know in the large vocabulary stu  , systems , people were evaluating on in the past , some people really pushed everything in to make it in one pass but other people didn't and had multiple passes . And , the argument , against multiple passes was u u has often been \" but we want to this to be r you know have a nice interactive response \" . And the counterargument to that which , say , BBN I think had , was \" yeah , but our second responses are second , passes and third passes are really , really fast \" . grad e: S so , the the idea of the second pass would be waiting till you have more recorded speech ? Or ? professor c: Yeah , so if it turned out to be a problem , that you didn't have enough speech because you need a longer longer window to do this processing , then , one tactic is you know , looking at the larger system and not just at the front - end stuff is to take in , the speech with some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism , grad e:   professor c: do the best you can , and come up with some al possible alternates of what might have been said . And , either in the form of an N - best list or in the form of a lattice , or or confusion network , or whatever . professor c: And then the decoding of that is much , much faster or can be much , much faster if it isn't a big bushy network . And you can decode that now with speech that you 've actually processed using this longer time , subtraction . professor c: So  , it 's it 's common that people do this sort of thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time , whatever , in some kind of second pass . professor c: and again , if the second pass is really , really fast  , another one I 've heard of is is in in connected digit stuff , going back and l and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be a d a digit , but , which have very low energy . professor c: So , there 's lots of things you can do in second passes , at all sorts of levels . phd a: So is that ,  that it ? grad e: I guess that 's it .  , so , the last two weeks was , like So I 've been working on that Wiener filtering . And , found that , s single like , I just do a s normal Wiener filtering , like the standard method of Wiener filtering . And that doesn't actually give me any improvement over like  , b it actually improves over the baseline but it 's not like it doesn't meet something like fifty percent or something . So , I 've been playing with the v phd a: Improves over the base line MFCC system ? Yeah . professor c: Is that using in combination with something else ? phd b: No , just just one stage Wiener filter professor c: With with a phd b: which is a standard Wiener filter . professor c: No , no , but  in combination with our on - line normalization or with the LDA ? phd b: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . phd b: So , I di i di professor c: So , does it g does that mean it gets worse ? Or ? phd b: No . Like I have an LDA f LDA plus on - line normalization , and then I plug in the Wiener filter in that , professor c: Yeah ? phd b: so it improves over not having the Wiener filter . So it improves but it it doesn't take it like be beyond like thirty percent over the baseline . So professor c: But that 's what I 'm confused about , cuz I think I thought that our system was more like forty percent without the Wiener filtering . phd a: Is this with the v new VAD ? phd b: well , these are not No , it 's the old VAD . So my baseline was , nine This is like w the baseline is ninety - five point six eight , and eighty - nine , and professor c: So  , if you can do all these in word errors it 's a lot a lot easier actually . phd b: What was that ? Sorry ? professor c: If you do all these in word error rates it 's a lot easier , right ? phd b: Oh , OK , OK , OK . phd d: The baseline is something similar to a w  , the t the the baseline that you are talking about is the MFCC baseline , right ? phd b: The t yeah , there are two baselines . So the baseline One baseline is MFCC baseline that When I said thirty percent improvement it 's like MFCC baseline . professor c: So so so what 's it start on ? The MFCC baseline is is what ? Is at what level ? phd b: It 's the it 's just the mel frequency and that 's it . professor c: No , what 's what 's the number ? phd b: so I I don't have that number here . What 's ten point seven ? phd b: It 's a medium misma OK , sorry . phd b: So professor c: OK , four point three , ten point seven , phd b: And forty forty . professor c: And what were you just describing ? phd b: Oh , the one is this one is just the baseline plus the , Wiener filter plugged into it . professor c: But where 's the , on - line normalization and so on ? phd b: Oh , OK . So , with the with the on - line normalization , the performance was , ten OK , so it 's like four point three . So the h well matched has like literally not changed by adding on - line or LDA on it . professor c: OK , and what kind of number an and what are we talking about here ? phd b: It 's the It - it 's Italian . professor c: Is this TI - digits phd b: I 'm talking about Italian , professor c: or Italian ? phd b: yeah . professor c: And what did So , what was the , corresponding number , say , for , the Alcatel system for instance ? phd b: Mmm .  professor c: Do you know ? phd d: Yeah , so it looks to be ,  phd b: You have it ? phd d: Yep , it 's three point four , eight point , seven , and , thirteen point seven . phd b: So , this is the single stage Wiener filter , with The noise estimation was based on first ten frames . phd b: Actually I started with using the VAD to estimate the noise and then I found that it works it doesn't work for Finnish and Spanish because the VAD endpoints are not good to estimate the noise because it cuts into the speech sometimes , so I end up overestimating the noise and getting a worse result . phd b: So ,  so this was ,  And so this was giving  , this this was like not improving a lot on this baseline of not having the Wiener filter on it . And , so , I ran this stuff with one more stage of Wiener filtering on it but the second time , what I did was I estimated the new Wiener filter based on the cleaned up speech , and did , smoothing in the frequency to to reduce the variance professor c:   phd b: I have I 've I 've observed there are , like , a lot of bumps in the frequency when I do this Wiener filtering which is more like a musical noise or something . And so by adding another stage of Wiener filtering , the results on the SpeechDat - Car was like ,  So , I still don't have the word error rate . And the rest is like the LDA plu and the on - line normalization all remaining the same .  , so this was , like , compared to ,  Fifty - seven is what you got by using the French Telecom system , right ? phd d: No , I don't think so . phd b: Y i phd d: Is it on Italian ? phd b: No , this is over the whole SpeechDat - Car . phd b: Yeah , so the new the new Wiener filtering schema is like some fifty - six point four six which is like one percent still less than what you got using the French Telecom system . But again , you 're you 're more or less doing what they were doing , right ? phd b: It 's it 's different in a sense like I 'm actually cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum which they 're not doing . They 're d what they 're doing is , they have two stage stages of estimating the Wiener filter , but the final filter , what they do is they they take it to their time domain by doing an inverse Fourier transform . phd b: And they filter the original signal using that fil filter , professor c:  - huh . phd b: which is like final filter is acting on the input noisy speech rather than on the cleaned up . So this is more like I 'm doing Wiener filter twice , but the only thing is that the second time I 'm actually smoothing the filter and then cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum first level . phd b: And actually I tried it on s the original clean  , the original spectrum where , like , I the second time I estimate the filter but actually clean up the noisy speech rather the c s first output of the first stage and that doesn't seems to be a giving , that much improvement . And and what I t what I tried was , by using the same thing but  , so we actually found that the VAD is very , like , crucial . phd b: by instead of using the current VAD , if you just take up the VAD output from the channel zero , when instead of using channel zero and channel one , because that was the p that was the reason why I was not getting a lot of improvement for estimating the noise . So I just used the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise so that it gives me some reliable mar markers for this noise estimation . professor c: What 's a channel zero VAD ? phd b: professor c: I 'm I 'm confused about that . phd b: so , it 's like phd d: So it 's the close - talking microphone . phd b: Yeah , the close - talking without professor c: Oh , oh , oh , oh . phd b: So because the channel zero and channel one are like the same speech , but only w  , the same endpoints . professor c:  phd b: But the only thing is that the speech is very noisy for channel one , so you can actually use the output of the channel zero for channel one for the VAD .  , so a are they going to pro What are they doing to do , do we know yet ? about as far as what they 're what the rules are going to be and what we can use ? phd d: Yeah , so actually I received a a new document , describing this . phd b: Yeah , that 's phd d: And what they did finally is to , mmm , not to align the utterances but to perform recognition , only on the close - talking microphone , phd b: Which is the channel zero . professor c: So it 's not like that 's being done in one place or one time . phd d: And professor c: That 's that 's just a rule and we 'd you you were permitted to do that . Is is that it ? phd d: I think they will send , files but we we don't Well , apparently professor c: Oh , so they will send files so everybody will have the same boundaries to work with ? phd d: Yeah . phd d: Oh , i Yeah , so what happened here is that , the overall improvement that they have with this method So Well , to be more precise , what they have is , they have these alignments and then they drop the beginning silence and and the end silence but they keep , two hundred milliseconds before speech and two hundred after speech .  , and the overall improvement over the MFCC baseline So , when they just , add this frame dropping in addition it 's r  , forty percent , right ? professor c:   phd b: Yeah , which is phd d: which is , t which is the overall improvement . phd b: It gives like negative Well , in in like some Italian and TI - digits , phd d: Yeah , some @ @ . So by using the endpointed speech , actually it 's worse than the baseline in some instances , which could be due to the word pattern . professor c: Yeah , phd d: And Yeah , the other thing also is that fourteen percent is less than what you obtain using a real VAD . phd d: So  So I think this shows that there is still work  , well , working on the VAD is still still important I think . professor c: Yeah , c phd d:  phd a: Can I ask just a a high level question ? Can you just say like one or two sentences about Wiener filtering and why why are people doing that ? phd b:  . phd a: What 's what 's the deal with that ? phd b: OK , so the Wiener filter , it 's it 's like it 's like you try to minimize  , so the basic principle of Wiener filter is like you try to minimize the , d  , difference between the noisy signal and the clean signal if you have two channels . Like let 's say you have a clean t signal and you have an additional channel where you know what is the noisy signal . And you get you can do that  , if if you have only a c noisy signal , at a level which you , you w try to estimate the noise from the w assuming that the first few frames are noise or if you have a w voice activity detector , you estimate the noise spectrum . phd b: And then you phd a: Do you assume the noise is the same ? phd b: Yeah . phd b: So but that 's not the case in , many many of our cases but it works reasonably well . And then you do this  , this is the transfer function of the Wiener filter , so \" SF \" is a clean speech spectrum , power spectrum phd a:   professor c: Right phd b: And , professor c: actually , I guess phd b: Yeah . phd b: So but the thing is that you have to estimate the SF from the noisy spectrum , what you have . So you estimate the NF from the initial noise portions and then you subtract that from the current noisy spectrum to get an estimate of the SF . phd a: So is this , basically s  , similar to just regular spectral subtraction ? phd b: It professor c: It 's all pretty related , phd b: Yeah . It 's it 's there 's a di there 's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise . phd a: Do people use the Wiener filtering in combination with the spectral subtraction typically , or is i are they sort of competing techniques ? phd b: Not seen . phd b: So it 's like I haven't seen anybody using s Wiener filter with spectral subtraction . professor c: but y but there you make different approximations , and in spectral subtraction , for instance , there 's a a an estimation factor . professor c: You sometimes will figure out what the noise is and you 'll multiply that noise spectrum times some constant and subtract that rather than and sometimes people even though this really should be in the power domain , sometimes people s work in the magnitude domain because it it it works better . phd a: So why did you choose , Wiener filtering over some other one of these other techniques ? phd b: the reason was , like , we had this choice of using spectral subtraction , Wiener filtering , and there was one more thing which I which I 'm trying , is this sub space approach . phd b: So I picked up phd a: So you 're sort of trying @ @ them all . phd b: Y Yeah , phd a: Ah , phd b: we just wanted to have a few noise production compensation techniques phd a: I see . professor c: I m  yeah , there 's Car - Carmen 's working on another , on the vector Taylor series . professor c: So they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things with this task and see , you know , what are what are the issues for each of them . phd b: So so one of one of the things that I tried , like I said , was to remove those zeros in the fri filter by doing some smoothing of the filter . phd b: Like , you estimate the edge of square and then you do a f smoothing across the frequency so that those zeros get , like , flattened out . So what I did was like I p did this and then you I plugged in the one more the same thing but with the smoothed filter the second time . phd b: So that 's where I got like fifty - six point five percent improvement on SpeechDat - Car with that . And So the other thing what I tried was I used still the ten frames of noise estimate but I used this channel zero VAD to drop the frames . And that has taken the performance to like sixty - seven percent in SpeechDat - Car , which is which which like sort of shows that by using a proper VAD you can just take it to further , better levels . phd a: So that 's sort of like , you know , best - case performance ? phd b: Yeah , so far I 've seen sixty - seven  , no , I haven't seen s like sixty - seven percent . And , using the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise also seems to be improving but I don't have the results for all the cases with that . So I used channel zero VAD to estimate noise as a lesser 2 x frame , which is like , everywhere I use the channel zero VAD . And that seems to be the best combination , rather than using a few frames to estimate and then drop a channel . phd b: so we c so  , which which means , like , by using this technique what we improve just the VAD professor c: Yes . And , w  Yeah , but this all these things , I have to still try it on the TI - digits , which is like I 'm just running . And there seems to be not improving a a lot on the TI - digits , so I 'm like investigating that , why it 's not . So ,  so the other the other thing is like I 've been I 'm doing all this stuff on the power spectrum . So Tried this stuff on the mel as well mel and the magnitude , and mel magnitude , and all those things . So , one of one of reasons I thought like doing the averaging , after the filtering using the mel filter bank , that seems to be maybe helping rather than trying it on the mel filter ba filtered outputs . phd b: Yeah , th that 's that 's the only thing that I could think of why why it 's giving improvement on the mel . professor c: how about the subspace stuff ? phd b: Subspace , I 'm I 'm like that 's still in a little bit in the back burner because I 've been p putting a lot effort on this to make it work , on tuning things and other stuff .  , So to r to remind you a little bit of of what I did before , is just to apply some spectral subtraction with an overestimation factor also to get , an estimate of the noise , spectrum , and subtract this estimation of the noise spectrum from the , signal spectrum , but subtracting more when the SNR is is , low , which is a technique that it 's often used . phd a: \" Subtracting more \" , meaning ? phd d: So you overestimate the noise spectrum . phd d: So , above twenty DB , it 's one , so you just subtract the noise . phd d: And then it 's b Generally Well , I use , actually , a linear , function of the SNR , phd a:   phd d: which is bounded to , like , two or three , when the SNR is below zero DB . phd d: doing just this , either on the FFT bins or on the mel bands , t doesn't yield any improvement professor c: Oh !  , what are you doing with negative , powers ? phd d: o Yeah . So there is also a threshold , of course , because after subtraction you can have negative energies , phd a:   phd d: and So what I I just do is to put ,  to to add to put the threshold first and then to add a small amount of noise , which right now is speech - shaped .  phd a: Speech - shaped ? phd d: Yeah , so it 's a it has the overall overall energy ,  pow it has the overall power spectrum of speech . phd a: So when y when you talk about there being something less than zero after subtracting the noise , is that at a particular frequency bin ? phd d: i  - huh . phd a: And so when you say you 're adding something that has the overall shape of speech , is that in a in a particular frequency bin ? Or you 're adding something across all the frequencies when you get these negatives ? phd d: For each frequencies I a I 'm adding some , noise , but the a the amount of the amount of noise I add is not the same for all the frequency bins . Right now I don't think if it makes sense to add something that 's speech - shaped , because then you have silence portion that have some spectra similar to the sp the overall speech spectra . So this is something I can still work on , phd a: So what does that mean ? phd d: but  . phd a: I 'm trying to understand what it means when you do the spectral subtraction and you get a negative . It means that at that particular frequency range you subtracted more energy than there was actually phd d: That means that   So so yeah , you have an an estimation of the noise spectrum , but sometimes , of course , it 's as the noise is not perfectly stationary , sometimes this estimation can be , too small , so you don't subtract enough . phd a: So in in an ideal word i world if the noise were always the same , then , when you subtracted it the worst that i you would get would be a zero .  , the lowest you would get would be a zero , cuz i if there was no other energy there you 're just subtracting exactly the noise . phd d:  -  , professor c: Yep , there 's all there 's all sorts of , deviations from the ideal here . professor c: for instance , you 're you 're talking about the signal and noise , at a particular point . And even if something is sort of stationary in ster terms of statistics , there 's no guarantee that any particular instantiation or piece of it is exactly a particular number or bounded by a particular range . professor c: So , you 're figuring out from some chunk of of of the signal what you think the noise is . professor c: and there 's absolutely no reason to think that you 'd know that it wouldn't , be negative in some places . professor c: on the other hand that just means that in some sense you 've made a mistake because you certainly have stra subtracted a bigger number than is due to the noise . professor c:  Also , we speak the whole where all this stuff comes from is from an assumption that signal and noise are uncorrelated . And that certainly makes sense in s in in a statistical interpretation , that , you know , over , all possible realizations that they 're uncorrelated phd a:   professor c: or assuming , ergodicity that i that i  , across time , it 's uncorrelated . But if you just look at a quarter second , and you cross - multiply the two things , you could very well , end up with something that sums to something that 's not zero . But if down the road you 're making use of something as if it is a power spectrum , then it can be bad to have something negative . Now , the other thing I wonder about actually is , what if you left it negative ? What happens ? phd b: Is that the log ? professor c: because  , are you taking the log before you add them up to the mel ? phd b: After that . So the thing is , I wonder how if you put your thresholds after that , I wonder how often you would end up with ,  with negative values . phd b: But you will But you end up reducing some neighboring frequency bins @ @ in the average , right ? When you add the negative to the positive value which is the true estimate . But nonetheless , you know , these are it 's another f kind of smoothing , right ? that you 're doing . So , you 've done your best shot at figuring out what the noise should be , and now i then you 've subtracted it off . And then after that , instead of instead of , leaving it as is and adding things adding up some neighbors , you artificially push it up . professor c: Which is , you know , it 's there 's no particular reason that that 's the right thing to do either , right ? phd b: Yeah , yeah . professor c: So , i in fact , what you 'd be doing is saying , \" well , we 're d we 're we 're going to definitely diminish the effect of this frequency in this little frequency bin in the in the overall mel summation \" . I d I don't know if it would be phd a: Sort of the opposite of that would be if if you find out you 're going to get a negative number , you don't do the subtraction for that bin . professor c: although phd a: That would be almost the opposite , right ? Instead of leaving it negative , you don't do it . If your if your subtraction 's going to result in a negative number , you you don't do subtraction in that . professor c: Yeah , but that means that in a situation where you thought that that the bin was almost entirely noise , you left it . phd d: And , yeah , some people also if it 's a negative value they , re - compute it using inter interpolation from the edges and bins . professor c: People can also , reflect it back up and essentially do a full wave rectification instead of a instead of half wave . Well , actually I tried , something else based on this , is to to put some smoothing , because it seems to to help or it seems to help the Wiener filtering professor c:   Actually , when you do spectral subtraction you can , find this this equivalent in the s in the spectral domain . You can  compute , y you can say that d your spectral subtraction is a filter , and the gain of this filter is the , signal energy minus what you subtract , divided by the signal energy . And this is a gain that varies over time , and , you know , of course , depending on the s on the noise spectrum and on the speech spectrum . And what happen actually is that during low SNR values , the gain is close to zero but it varies a lot . Mmm , and this this is the cause of musical noise and all these the the fact you we go below zero one frame and then you can have an energy that 's above zero . But it 's the smoothing is nonlinear in the sense that I tried to not smooth if the gain is high , because in this case we know that , the estimate of the gain is correct because we we are not close to to to zero , and to do more smoothing if the gain is low . So , well , basically that 's this idea , and it seems to give pretty good results , although I 've just just tested on Italian and Finnish . And on Italian it seems my result seems to be a little bit better than the Wiener filtering , phd b:   phd d: I don't know if you have these improvement the detailed improvements for Italian , Finnish , and Spanish there phd b: Fff . No , I don't have , for each , phd d: or you have just have your own . professor c: So these numbers he was giving before with the four point three , and the ten point one , and so forth , those were Italian , right ? phd b: Yeah , yeah , yeah . phd d:  phd b: I actually didn't give you the number which is the final one , phd d: no , we 've phd b: which is , after two stages of Wiener filtering . phd d:  professor c: But do you have numbers in terms of word error rates on on Italian ? So just so you have some sense of reference ? phd d: Yeah . professor c: And this is , spectral subtraction plus what ? phd d: Plus plus nonlinear smoothing . Well , it 's the system it 's exactly the sys the same system as Sunil tried , professor c: On - line normalization and LDA ? phd d: but professor c: Yeah . But instead of double stage Wiener filtering , it 's it 's this smoothed spectral subtraction . phd a: for Do they use spectral subtraction , or Wiener filtering , or ? phd b: They use spectral subtraction , right . phd d: It it 's Wiener filtering , phd b: Oh , it 's it 's Wiener filtering . professor c: Yeah , plus , I guess they have some sort of cepstral normalization , as well . phd b: s They have like yeah , th the just noise compensation technique is a variant of Wiener filtering , phd d:   phd d: One in the time domain and one in the frequency domain by just taking the first , coefficients of the impulse response .  , what you did , it 's similar phd b: It 's similar in the smoothing and phd d: because you have also two two kind of smoothing . phd d: One in the time domain , and one in the frequency domain , phd b: Yeah . phd a: Does the smoothing in the time domain help phd d:  phd a: Well , do you get this musical noise stuff with Wiener filtering or is that only with , spectral subtraction ? phd b: No , you get it with Wiener filtering also . phd a: Does the smoothing in the time domain help with that ? Or some other smoothing ? phd b: Oh , no , you still end up with zeros in the s spectrum . phd b: the phd d: Well , I cannot you cannot hear beca well , actually what I d did not say is that this is not in the FFT bins .  So , it could be seen as a f a a smoothing in the frequency domain because I used , in ad mel bands in addition and then the other phase of smoothing in the time domain . But , when you look at the spectrogram , if you don't have an any smoothing , you clearly see , like in silence portions , and at the beginning and end of speech , you see spots of high energy randomly distributed over the the spectrogram . phd d:  phd a: That 's the musical noise ? phd d: Which is musical noise , phd a:   phd d: yeah , if if it If you listen to it  , if you do this in the FFT bins , then you have spots of energy randomly distributing . And if you f if you re - synthesize these spot sounds as , like , sounds , phd a:   phd d:  professor c: Well , none of these systems , by the way , have  , y you both are are working with , our system that does not have the neural net , phd d: And phd b: Yep . So one would hope , presumably , that the neural net part of it would would improve things further as as they did before .  Yeah , although if if we , look at the result from the proposals , one of the reason , the n system with the neural net was , more than well , around five percent better , is that it was much better on highly mismatched condition . I 'm thinking , for instance , on the TI - digits trained on clean speech and tested on noisy speech . phd d: And if we have no , spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , i the system is  , we thought the neural neural network is much better than before , even in these cases of high mismatch . phd a: Could you train a neural net to do spectral subtraction ? professor c: Yeah , it could do a nonlinear spectral subtraction phd d:   professor c: but I don't know if it  , you have to figure out what your targets are . phd a: Yeah , I was thinking if you had a clean version of the signal and and a noisy version , and your targets were the M F -  , you know , whatever , frequency bins phd d:   professor c: Yeah , well , that 's not so much spectral subtraction then , phd d:   professor c: but but but it 's but at any rate , yeah , people ,  phd a: People do that ? professor c: y yeah , in fact , we had visitors here who did that I think when you were here ba way back when . professor c: The objection everyone always raises , which has some truth to it is that , it 's good for mapping from a particular noise to clean but then you get a different noise . professor c: And the experiments we saw that visitors did here showed that it there was at least some , gentleness to the degradation when you switched to different noises . phd a: How did it compare on  , for for good cases where it it  , stuff that it was trained on ? Did it do pretty well ? professor c: Oh , yeah , it did very well .  , we 're not doing exactly that , we 're not trying to generate good examples but by trying to do the best classifier you possibly can , for these little phonetic categories , phd a: it we 'll just have to see whether it helps more or less the same , but I would imagine it would help some . professor c: So in any event , all of this I was just confirming that all of this was with a simpler system .  , Yeah , so this is th the ,  Well , actually , this was kind of the first try with this spectral subtraction plus smoothing , professor c:   And it seems that the one that I chose for the first experiment was the optimal one , so  , professor c: It 's amazing how often that happens .  Yeah , another thing that I it 's important to mention is , that this has a this has some additional latency . Because when I do the smoothing , it 's a recursion that estimated the means , so of the g of the gain curve . So , instead o of using the current estimated mean to , subtract the current frame , it 's better to use an estimate that 's some somewhere in the future . phd b: You mean , the m the mean is computed o based on some frames in the future also ? professor c:   phd b: Or or no ? phd d: It 's the recursion , so it 's it 's the center recursion , right ? phd b:   professor c: One five ? phd d:  professor c: One five ? Five zero ? phd d: Five zero , professor c: Five zero . phd b: why why is that delay coming ? Like , you estimate the mean ? phd d: Yeah , the mean estimation has some delay , right ? phd b: Oh , yeah . phd b: It isn't OK , so it 's like it looks into the future also . professor c: What if you just look into the past ? phd d: It 's , not as good . professor c: How m by how much ? phd d: it helps a lot over the ba the baseline but , mmm professor c: By how much ? phd d: it It 's around three percent , relative . phd d: mmm So ,  professor c: It 's depending on how all this stuff comes out we may or may not be able to add any latency . Yeah , b but I don't think we have to worry too much on that right now while you kno . professor c: s Yeah , I think the only thing is that phd d: So professor c: I would worry about it a little . professor c: Because if we completely ignore latency , and then we discover that we really have to do something about it , we 're going to be find ourselves in a bind . professor c: Yeah , just , you know , just be be a little conservative phd d: Oh yes . professor c: because we may end up with this crunch where all of a sudden we have to cut the latency in half or something . So , yeah , there are other things in the , algorithm that I didn't , @ @ a lot yet , phd a: Oh ! phd d: which phd a: Sorry . If if there 's another part of the system that causes a latency of a hundred milliseconds , is this an additive thing ? Or c or is yours hidden in that ? phd d:   We can do something in parallel also , in some like some cases like , if you wanted to do voice activity detection . phd b: So you can make a decision on that voice activity detection and then you decide whether you want to filter or not . phd a: couldn't ,  I Couldn't you just also  , i if you know that the l the largest latency in the system is two hundred milliseconds , don't you couldn't you just buffer up that number of frames and then everything uses that buffer ? phd b: Yeah . phd a: And that way it 's not additive ? professor c: Well , in fact , everything is sent over in buffers cuz of isn't it the TCP buffer some ? phd b: You mean , the the data , the super frame or something ? phd d:   phd b: Yeah , but that has a variable latency because the last frame doesn't have any latency phd d:   phd b: So But the only thing is that the first frame in that twenty - four frame buffer has a twenty - four frame latency . phd b: Because it just goes as phd a: Yeah , I wasn't thinking of that one in particular phd b: Yeah . phd a: but more of , you know , if if there is some part of your system that has to buffer twenty frames , can't the other parts of the system draw out of that buffer and therefore not add to the latency ? professor c: Yeah . And and that 's sort of one of the all of that sort of stuff is things that they 're debating in their standards committee . Like , I played a little bit with this overestimation factor , but I still have to to look more at this , at the level of noise I add after .  , I know that adding noise helped , the system just using spectral subtraction without smoothing , but I don't know right now if it 's still important or not , and if the level I choose before is still the right one .  , and another thing is to Yeah , for this I just use as noise estimate the mean , spectrum of the first twenty frames of each utterance . I don't remember for this experiment what did you use for these two stage phd b: I used ten just ten frames . Yeah , because phd d: The ten frames ? phd b: the reason was like in TI - digits I don't have a lot . But , so what 's this result you told me about , the fact that if you use more than ten frames you can improve by t phd b: Well , that 's that 's using the channel zero . phd b: Which phd d: But this is ten frames plus plus phd b: Channel zero dropping . phd d: no , these results with two stage Wiener filtering is ten frames phd b: t Oh , this phd d: but possibly more . The second thing I was working on is to , try to look at noise estimation , mmm , and using some technique that doesn't need voice activity detection .  , and for this I u simply used some code that , I had from from Belgium , which is technique that , takes a bunch of frame , and for each frequency bands of this frame , takes a look at the minima of the energy . And then average these minima and take this as an an energy estimate of the noise for this particular frequency band . So , I compute an FFT based on the long , signal frame which is sixty - four millisecond phd a: So you have one minimum for each frequency ? phd d: What what I what I d  , I do actually , is to take a bunch of to take a tile on the spectrogram and this tile is five hundred milliseconds long and two hundred hertz wide . phd d: And this tile  , in this tile appears , like , the harmonics if you have a voiced sound , because it 's it 's the FTT bins . And when you take the m the minima of of these this tile , when you don't have speech , these minima will give you some noise level estimate , If you have voiced speech , these minima will still give you some noise estimate because the minima are between the harmonics . And If you have other other kind of speech sounds then it 's not the case , but if the time frame is long enough , like s five hundred milliseconds seems to be long enough , you still have portions which , are very close whi which minima are very close to the noise energy . You said five hundred milliseconds phd d: Mmm ? professor c: but you said sixty - four milliseconds . Which is which ? What ? phd d: Sixty - four milliseconds is to compute the FFT , bins . phd d: actually it 's better to use sixty - four milliseconds because , if you use thirty milliseconds , then , because of the this short windowing and at low pitch , sounds , the harmonics are not , wha  , correctly separated . phd d: So if you take these minima , it b they will overestimate the noise a lot . professor c: So you take sixty - four millisecond F F Ts and then you average them over five hundred ? Or ?  , what do you do over five hundred ? phd d: So I take to I take a bunch of these sixty - four millisecond frame to cover five hundred milliseconds , professor c: Ah . phd d: on the on on the bunch of  fifty frames , right ? professor c: I see . So the interest of this is that , as y with this technique you can estimate u some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of of signal , so if the the n the noise varies a lot , you can track better track the noise , professor c:   The only requirement is that you must have , in these five hundred milliseconds segment , you must have voiced sound at least . So what I did is just to simply replace the VAD - based , noise estimate by this estimate , first on SpeechDat - Car Well , only on SpeechDat - Car actually . And it 's , slightly worse , like one percent relative compared to the VAD - based estimates .  , I think the reason why it 's not better , is that the SpeechDat - Car noises are all stationary . So , u y y there really is no need to have something that 's adaptive professor c:   But , I expect s maybe some improvement on TI - digits because , nnn , in this case the noises are all sometimes very variable . professor c: But are you comparing with something e I 'm I 'm p s a little confused again , i it  , when you compare it with the V A D - based , phd d:   professor c: VAD - Is this is this the ? phd d: It 's It 's the France - Telecom - based spectra , s  , Wiener filtering and VAD . professor c: Oh , you 're not doing this with our system ? phd d: In i I 'm not No , no . Actually , th the best system that we still have is , our system but with their noise compensation scheme , right ? professor c: Right . But phd d: So I 'm trying to improve on this , and by by replacing their noise estimate by , something that might be better . professor c: Couldn't you try this for that ? phd d: But I di professor c: Do you think it might help ? phd d: Not yet , because I did this in parallel , professor c: I see , phd d: and I was working on one and the other . phd b: So I 'm also using that n new noise estimate technique on this Wiener filtering what I 'm trying . phd b: So I I have , like , some experiments running , I don't have the results .  , the idea is just to  , flatten the log , spectrum , and to flatten it more if the the probability of silence is higher . So in this way , you can also reduce somewhat reduce the musical noise and you reduce the variability if you have different noise shapes , because the the spectrum becomes more flat in the silence portions . With this , no improvement , but there are a lot of parameters that we can play with and ,  Actually , this this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping because , you could just put the threshold and say that \" below the threshold , I will flatten comp completely flatten the the spectrum \" . So it would be like frame dropping , because during the silence portions which are below the threshold of voice activity probability , w you would have some kind of dummy frame which is a perfectly flat spectrum . And this , whitening is something that 's more soft because , you whiten you just , have a function the whitening is a function of the speech probability , so it 's not a hard decision . phd d: so I think maybe it can be used together with frame dropping and when we are not sure about if it 's speech or silence , well , maybe it has something do with this .  , you know , in in JRASTA we were essentially adding in , white  , white noise dependent on our estimate of the noise . professor c: You could imagine one that that that made use of where where the amount that you added in was , a function of the probability of it being s speech or noise . Yeah , w Yeah , right now it 's a constant that just depending on the the noise spectrum . professor c: Cuz that that brings in sort of powers of classifiers that we don't really have in , this other estimate . professor c: What what what point does the , system stop recording ? How much phd a: It 'll keep going till I guess when they run out of disk space , professor c: It went a little long ?  , disk phd a: but I think we 're OK .  Yeah , so there are with this technique there are some I just did something exactly the same as as the Ericsson proposal but , the probability of speech is not computed the same way . And I think , i for yeah , for a lot of things , actually a g a good speech probability is important . Like for frame dropping you improve , like you can improve from ten percent as Sunil showed , if you use the channel zero speech probabilities .  , so yeah , the next thing I started to do is to , try to develop a better voice activity detector . And ,  I d  yeah , for this I think we can maybe try to train the neural network for voice activity detection on all the data that we have , including all the SpeechDat - Car data .  , and the way I mi I do that is that I just use the HTK system but I train it only on the close - talking microphone .  It seems to be ,  i Actually what I observed is that for Italian it doesn't seem Th - there seems to be a problem . Because What ? phd b: you mean their d the frame dropping , right ? Yeah , it doesn't phd d: Yeah . phd d: so  , the c the current VAD that we have was trained on , t SPINE , right ? phd b: TI - digits . And actually we observed we listened to some of the utterances and sometimes for Finnish there is music in the recordings and strange things , right ? phd b: Yeah . phd d:  Yeah , so the idea was to train all the databases and obtain an alignment to train on these databases , and , also to , try different kind of features , as input to the VAD network . And we came up with a bunch of features that we want to try like , the spectral slope , the , the degree o degree of voicing with the features that , we started to develop with Carmen , e with , the correlation between bands and different kind of features , phd b: Yeah . Well , Hans - Guenter will be here next week so I think he 'll be interested in all all of these things <doc-sep>Actually , I think he he redirected it to everybody also so  the PDA mikes  have a big bunch of energy at at  five hertz  where this came up was that  I was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web and and  I just sort of hadn't noticed this , but that the major , major component in the wave in the second wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner . I I have to be more careful about using that as a as a as a good illustration , in fact it 's not , of  of the effects of room reverberation . And then we had this other discussion about  whether this affects the dynamic range , cuz I know , although we start off with thirty two bits , you end up with  sixteen bits and you know , are we getting hurt there ? But  Dan is pretty confident that we 're not , that that quantization error is not is still not a significant factor there . So there was a question of whether we should change things here , whether we should change a capacitor on the input box for that or whether we should phd b: Yeah , he suggested a smaller capacitor , right ? professor a: Right . But then I had some other  thing discussions with him phd b: For the P D professor a: and the feeling was once we start monk monkeying with that , many other problems could ha happen . professor a: A simple thing to do is he he he has a I forget if it this was in that mail or in the following mail , but he has a a simple filter , a digital filter that he suggested . professor a:  The other thing that I don't know the answer to , but when people are using Feacalc here ,  whether they 're using it with the high - pass filter option or not . So when we 're doing all these things using our software there is  if it 's if it 's based on the RASTA - PLP program , which does both PLP and RASTA - PLP  then  there is an option there which then comes up through to Feacalc which  allows you to do high - pass filtering and in general we like to do that , because of things like this and it 's it 's pretty it 's not a very severe filter . Doesn't affect speech frequencies , even pretty low speech frequencies , at all , but it 's phd b: What 's the cut - off frequency it used ? professor a: Oh . I don't know I wrote this a while ago phd b: Is it like twenty ? professor a: Something like that .  I think there 's some effect above twenty but it 's it 's it 's it 's mild . So ,  it probably there 's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it 's it 's pretty mild . I don't know in the in the STRUT implementation of the stuff is there a high - pass filter or a pre pre - emphasis or something in the phd f:  . We we we want to go and check that in i for anything that we 're going to use the P D A mike for .  He says that there 's a pretty good roll off in the PZM mikes so we don't need need to worry about them one way or the other but if we do make use of the cheap mikes ,  we want to be sure to do that that filtering before we process it . And then again if it 's  depending on the option that the our our software is being run with , it 's it 's quite possible that 's already being taken care of .  the thing is it was since I was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise , it wasn't a good match , but it certainly was still  an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes .  It 's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it 's a noise that we definitely know what to do . professor a: So , it doesn't take deep a new bold new methods to get rid of  five hertz noise , so . So it was it was a bad example in that way , but it 's it still is it 's the real thing that we did get out of the microphone at distance , so it wasn't it w it w wasn't wrong it was inappropriate . So  , but  , Yeah , someone noticed it later pointed it out to me , and I went \" oh , man .  So I think we 'll change our our picture on the web , when we 're @ @ . One of the things I was  , I was trying to think about what what 's the best way to show the difference an and I had a couple of thoughts one was , that spectrogram that we show is O K , but the thing is the eyes  and the the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns from from noise that in first glance you look at them it doesn't seem like it 's that bad  because there 's many features that are still preserved . So one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the spec  of the spectrogram where you can see that something looks different , an and blow it up , and have that be the part that 's just to show as well .  Another , I was thinking of was  taking some spectral slices , like  like we look at with the recognizer , and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there , and the the  , the reverberation  does make it does change that . grad c: W w what d what do you mean ? professor a: Well ,   all the recognizers look at frames . professor a: So it 's , yeah , at one point in time or  twenty over twenty milliseconds or something , you have a spectrum or a cepstrum . And if you look at phd b: You could just you could just throw up , you know ,  the  some MFCC feature vectors . You know , one from one , one from the other , and then , you know , you can look and see how different the numbers are . Well , that 's why I saying either Well , either spectrum or cepstrum phd b: I 'm just kidding . professor a: but but I think the thing is you wanna  phd b: I don't mean a graph . Yeah , at first I had a remark why I am wondering why the PDA is always so far . Since the last meeting we 've we 've tried to put together  the clean low - pass  downsampling , upsampling ,  the new filter that 's replacing the LDA filters , and also the  delay issue so that We considered th the the delay issue on the for the on - line normalization . professor a: But it 's not wer worse and it 's better better latency , phd f: It 's not professor a: right ? phd f: Yeah . It seems better when we look at the mismatched case but I think we are like like cheated here by the th this problem that  in some cases when you modify slight slightly modify the initial condition you end up completely somewhere air somewhere else in the in the space , the parameters . For Italian is at seventy - eight percent recognition rate on the mismatch , and this new system has eighty - nine . I don't I don't think it means that the new system is more robust professor a:  - huh . professor a: Well , the test would be if you then tried it on one of the other test sets , if if it was phd f: Y professor a: Right . professor a: So then if you take your changes phd f: It 's similar for other test sets professor a: and then phd f: but  from this se seventy - eight  percent recognition rate system , I could change the transition probabilities for the the first  and it will end up to eighty - nine also . phd f: By using point five instead of point six , point four as in the the HTK script . phd b:  th the only difference is you change the self - loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent phd f: Yeah . From point phd f: Even tenth of a percent ? phd b: I I 'm sorry phd f: Well , we tried we tried point one , phd b: f for point from You change at point one phd f: yeah . professor a: Oh ! phd b: and n not tenth of a percent , one tenth , phd f:  . phd b: alright ?  so from point five so from point six to point five and you get ten percent better . phd b: And it 's I think it 's what you basically hypothesized in the last meeting about  it just being very phd f:   phd b: and I think you mentioned this in your email too it 's just very  phd f: Mmm , yeah . phd b: you know get stuck in some local minimum and this thing throws you out of it I guess . professor a: Well , what 's what are according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ? Are they supposed to be point five or point six ? phd b: I think you 're not allowed to Yeah . But changing it to point five I think is which gives you much better results , but that 's not allowed . phd f: Yeah , but even if you use point five , I 'm not sure it will always give you the better results phd b: Yeah . We only tested it on the the medium mismatch , phd f: on the other training set ,  . phd b: right ? You said on the other cases you didn't notice phd f: Yeah . I think the reason is , yeah , I not I it was in my mail I think also , is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone . Well , in for the mismatched case everything is  using the far microphone training and testing , whereas for the highly mismatched , training is done on the close microphone so it 's it 's clean speech basically so you don't have this problem of local minima probably and for the well - match , it 's a mix of close microphone and distant microphone and Well . phd b: I did notice  something phd f: So th I think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training part . phd b: Somebody , I think it was Morgan , suggested at the last meeting that I actually count to see how many parameters and how many frames . phd b: And there are  almost one point eight million frames of training data and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system . phd b: I did one quick experiment just to make sure I had everything worked out and I just  f for most of the  For for all of the digit models , they end up at three mixtures per state . And so I just did a quick experiment , where I changed it so it went to four and  it it it didn't have a r any significant effect at the  medium mismatch and high mismatch cases and it had it was just barely significant for the well - matched better . And I think also just seeing what we saw  in terms of the expected duration of the silence model ? when we did this tweaking of the self - loop ? The silence model expected duration was really different . phd b: And so in the case where  it had a better score , the silence model expected duration was much longer . I think you know if we make a better silence model I think that will help a lot too  for a lot of these cases so but one one thing I I wanted to check out before I increased the  number of mixtures per state was  in their default training script they do an initial set of three re - estimations and then they built the silence model and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures and they do another seven then they add mixtures then they do a final set of seven and they quit . Seven seems like a lot to me and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time  to do one turn - around of the well matched case takes like a day . phd b: And so you know in trying to run these experiments I notice , you know , it 's difficult to find machines , you know , compute the run on . And so one of the things I did was I compiled HTK for the Linux machines professor a:   phd b: cuz we have this one from IBM that 's got like five processors in it ? professor a: Right . phd b: and so now I 'm you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we 've got you know , extra machines that we can use for compute . And if I 'm do running an experiment right now where I 'm changing the number of iterations ? from seven to three ? phd d:   And so if we can get away with just doing three , we can do many more experiments more quickly . And if it 's not a a huge difference from running with seven iterations , you know , we should be able to get a lot more experiments done . But if we can you know , run all of these back - ends f with many fewer iterations and on Linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done . So I wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before I increased the number of Gaussians . professor a: But they 're not making things worse and we have reduced latency , right ? phd f: Yeah . But actually  actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well - matched case and we just noticed that Yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny . It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , it 's a weighted mean of improvements . Which means that actually the weight on the well - matched is Well I well what what What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case it will have  huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference because the reference system is is is quite good for for the well - ma well - matched case also . phd b: So it it weights the improvement on the well - matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases ? phd f: No , but it 's the weighting of the of the improvement not of the error rate . Yeah , and it 's hard to improve on the on the best case , cuz it 's already so good , right ? phd f: Yeah but what  is that you can have a huge improvement on the H HMK 's ,  like five percent  absolute , and this will not affect the final score almost  this will almost not affect the final score because this improvement because the improvement  relative to the the baseline is small professor a: So they do improvement in terms of  accuracy ? rather than word error rate ? phd f:  .  improvement ? professor a: So phd f: No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate , professor a: OK . professor a: So if you have  ten percent error and you get five percent absolute  improvement then that 's fifty percent . So what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , then  a even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , will show up as quite quite large in this . Sure , but when we think about the weighting , which is point five , point three , point two , it 's on absolute on on relative figures , professor a: Yeah . That 's why I 've been saying we should be looking at word error rate  and and not not at at accuracies . phd b: it 's not it 's not that different , right ?  , just subtract the accuracy . professor a: Yeah but you 're but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different . professor a: If you had ninety percent  correct and five percent , five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference , but five over ten is is big . professor a: So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and getting sense of what was important . professor a: What 's a little bit ? Like phd f: Like , it 's difficult to say because again  I 'm not sure I have the  phd b: Hey Morgan ? Do you remember that Signif program that we used to use for testing signi ? Is that still valid ? I I 've been using that . I just use my old one from ninety - two or whatever professor a: Yeah , I 'm sure it 's not that different but but he he  he was a little more rigorous , as I recall . s phd f:  well we start from ninety - four point sixty - four , and we go to ninety - four point O four . For Finnish , we start to ninety - three point eight - four and we go to ninety - three point seventy - four . And for Spanish we are we were at ninety - five point O five and we go to ninety - three - s point sixty one . professor a: And is that wh what do you know what piece you 've done several changes here . Because nnn , well  we don't have complete result , but the filter So the filter with the shorter delay hurts on Italian well - matched , which And , yeah . And the other things , like  downsampling , upsampling , don't seem to hurt and the new on - line normalization , neither . If we saw that making a small change like , you know , a tenth , to the self - loop had a huge effect , can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff ? phd f:   phd f: I think we can be completely fooled by this thing , but I don't know . There is first this thing , and then the yeah , I computed the  like , the confidence level on the different test sets . professor a: But OK , so you these these degradations you were talking about were on the well - matched case phd f: So . Do the does the new filter make things  better or worse for the other cases ? phd f: Yeah . OK , so  I guess the argument one might make is that , \" Yeah , if you looked at one of these cases and you jiggle something and it changes then  you 're not quite sure what to make of it . But when you look across a bunch of these and there 's some some pattern , so eh h here 's all the if if in all these different cases it never gets better , and there 's significant number of cases where it gets worse , then you 're probably hurting things , I would say . So   at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with with a different test set , that you 're not jiggling things with . What I was asking , though , is  are what 's what 's the level of communication with  the O G I gang now , about this and phd f: Well , we are exchanging mail as soon as we we have significant results . We are working on our side on other things like  also trying a sup spectral subtraction but of of our own , another spectral substraction . It 's going professor a: Is there any further discussion about this this idea of of having some sort of source code control ? phd f: Yeah . As soon as we have something that 's significant and that 's better than than what was submitted , we will fix fix the system and But we 've not discussed it it it this yet , yeah . Sounds like a great idea but but I think that that  he 's saying people are sort of scrambling for a Eurospeech deadline . Anybo - anybody in the in this group do doing anything for Eurospeech ? phd f: S professor a: Or , is that what is that phd f: Yeah we are We are trying to to do something with the Meeting Recorder digits , professor a: Right . phd f: and , well , some people from OGI are working on a paper for this , but there is also the  special session about th Aurora which is  which has an extended deadline . professor a: So the deadline When 's the deadline ? When 's the deadline ? phd f:  ? I think it 's the thirteenth of May . So , I I think that you could certainly start looking at at the issue  but but  I think it 's probably , on s from what Stephane is saying , it 's it 's unlikely to get sort of active participation from the two sides until after they 've phd b: Well I could at least Well , I 'm going to be out next week but I could try to look into like this  CVS over the web . That seems to be a very popular way of people distributing changes and over , you know , multiple sites and things professor a:   phd b: so maybe if I can figure out how do that easily and then pass the information on to everybody so that it 's you know , as easy to do as possible and and people don't it won't interfere with their regular work , then maybe that would be good . And if you 're interested in using CVS , I 've set it up here , phd b: Oh great . grad c:  j phd b: I used it a long time ago but it 's been a while so maybe I can ask you some questions . Maybe you and I can talk a little bit at some point about coming up with a better  demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page , cuz  the    , actually the the  It made a good good audio demonstration because when we could play that clip the the the really obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and in the second one and only hear phd b: Maybe we could just like , talk into a cup . professor a: No , it sound it sounds pretty reverberant , but  you can't when you play it back in a room with a you know a big room , nobody can hear that difference really . professor a: They hear that it 's lower amplitude and they hear there 's a second voice , grad c:  - huh . professor a:  but  that actually that makes for a perfectly good demo because that 's a real obvious thing , that you hear two voices . But for the the visual , just , you know , I 'd like to have   , you know , the spectrogram again , grad c: Yeah . professor a: because you 're you 're you 're visual  abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out you know , you you look at the good one , you look at the cru the screwed up one , and and you can see the features in it without trying to @ @ phd b: I noticed that in the pictures . phd b: I thought \" hey , you know th \" I My initial thought was \" this is not too bad ! \" professor a: Right . But you have to you know , if you look at it closely , you see \" well , here 's a place where this one has a big formant   formant maj major formants here are are moving quite a bit . professor a: So  you could that 's why I was thinking , in a section like that , you could take a look look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say \" Oh yeah . The main thing that struck me in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies . It looked like for the one that was farther away , you know , it really everything was attenuated professor a: Right . Since you 're getting all this indirect energy , then a lot of it does have have  reduced high frequencies . But  the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed , and and  we want to show that , in some obvious way . \" but I I just  After after  they were put in there I didn't really look at them anymore , cuz I just they were different . So maybe we can just substitute one of these wave forms and  then do some kind of zoom in on the spectrogram on an interesting area . professor a: The other thing that we had in there that I didn't like was that  the most obvious characteristic of the difference  when you listen to it is that there 's a second voice , and the the the the the  cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full wave form . It 's just the first I think there was something where he was having some trouble getting so much in , or . But it it 's  it 's the first six seconds or something of it and it 's in the seventh or eighth second or something where @ @ the second voice comes in . So we we would like to actually see the voice coming in , too , I think , since that 's the most obvious thing when you listen to it . phd f: So the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this , the Wall  process , which contains LDA on - line normalization . phd f: And so we started to look at at  things like this , which is , well , it 's Yeah . And the sentence contain only one word , which is \" Due \" And it can't clearly be seen . phd f: Where is the word ? phd b: This is this is , grad e:  . phd f: This is a plot of C - zero ,  when we don't use spectral substraction , and when there is no on - line normalization . phd f:  then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure , though it is not . phd f: and And then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization . What we can clearly see is that on the speech portion the two channel come becomes very close , but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the variance of the noise is professor a:   phd b: Can I ask  what does variance normalization do ? w What is the effect of that ? professor a: Normalizes the variance . phd f: So it phd b: No , I understand that , phd f: You you get an estimate of the standard deviation . phd f:  phd b: No , I understand what it is , but  , what does it what 's what is phd f: Yeah but . professor a: Well , because everything  If you have a system based on Gaussians , everything is based on means and variances . professor a: So if there 's an overall reason You know , it 's like  if you were doing  image processing and in some of the pictures you were looking at ,  there was a lot of light  and and in some , there was low light , phd b:   professor a: And the variance is just sort of like the next moment , you know ? So  what if  one set of pictures was taken  so that throughout the course it was went through daylight and night    ten times , another time it went thr  i is , you know , how how much how much vari phd b: Oh , OK . I guess a better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside rather than artificial light . So if it was a lot if more was coming from outside , then there 'd be the bigger effect of the of the of the change in the So every mean every all all of the the parameters that you have , especially the variances , are going to be affected by the overall variance . professor a: And so , in principle , you if you remove that source , then , you know , you can phd b: I see . So would the major effect is that you 're gonna get is by normalizing the means , professor a: That 's the first order but thing , phd b: but it may help First - order effects . professor a: but then the second order is is the variances phd b: And it may help to do the variance . professor a: because , again , if you if you 're trying to distinguish between E and B phd b: OK . professor a: if it just so happens that the E 's were a more you know , were recorded when when the energy was was was larger or something , phd b:    professor a: or the variation in it was larger ,  than with the B 's , then this will be give you some some bias . phd b:  professor a: So the it 's removing these sources of variability in the data that have nothing to do with the linguistic component . And it and this professor a: i is if If you have a good voice activity detector , isn't isn't it gonna pull that out ? phd f: Yeah . Well what it it shows is that , yeah , perhaps a good voice activity detector is is good before on - line normalization and that 's what  we 've already observed . phd b: I don't know , it seems like this would be a lot easier than this signal to work with . What I notice is that , while I prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one , well , because you clearly see where speech is . phd f: But the problem is that on the speech portion , channel zero and channel one are more different than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer . phd b: But for the purposes of finding the speech phd f: And Yeah , but here phd b: You 're more interested in the difference between the speech and the nonspeech , phd f: Yeah . For I th I think that it perhaps it shows that  the parameters that the voice activity detector should use  have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition . phd f: Well , y professor a: So you can do that by doing the voi voice activity detection . You also could do it by spect  spectral subtraction before the variance normalization , right ? phd f: Yeah , but it 's not clear , yeah . phd f: the the number that at that are here are recognition experiments on Italian HM and  with these two kinds of parameters . phd b: Where 's th phd f: But the fact is that the voice activity detector doesn't work on channel one . phd b: Where at what stage is the voice activity detector applied ? Is it applied here or a after the variance normalization ? phd f:  ? professor a: Spectral subtraction , I guess . Is it applied all the way back here ? phd f: It 's applied the  on , yeah , something like this , phd b: Maybe that 's why it doesn't work for channel one . professor a: Can I phd f: So we could perhaps do just mean normalization before VAD . Can I ask a ,  a sort of top - level question , which is  \" if if most of what the OGI folk are working with is trying to integrate this other other  spectral subtraction , why are we worrying about it ? \" phd f:   phd f: It 's just  Well it 's another They are trying to u to use the  the Ericsson and we 're trying to use something something else . When we do spectral subtraction , actually , I think that this is the the two last figures . phd b: Speech is more what ? phd f: Well , the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the n spectral subtrac subtracted noise portion is is larger . phd f: Well , if you compare the first figure to this one Actually the scale is not the same , but if you look at the the numbers  you clearly see that the difference between the C - zero of the speech and C - zero of the noise portion is larger .  but what happens is that after spectral subtraction , you also increase the variance of this of C - zero . And what they did at OGI is just  they don't use on - line normalization , for the moment , on spectral subtraction and I think Yeah . So yeah , we 're working on the same thing but I think  with different different system and professor a: Right .  , i the Intellectually it 's interesting to work on things th  one way or the other phd f:   professor a: but I 'm I 'm just wondering if  on the list of things that there are to do , if there are things that we won't do because we 've got two groups doing the same thing . phd b: if  you know , if if if you work on something else and and you 're waiting for them to give you spectral subtraction  it 's hard to know whether the effects that you get from the other experiments you do will carry over once you then bring in their spectral subtraction module . I don't know if that 's true or not , but I could see how phd f: Mmm .  , we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which which isn't quite what you 'd like it to be . And then  weren't issues of of having a a second stream or something ? That was Was it There was this business that , you know , we we could use up the full forty - eight hundred bits , and phd f: Yeah . And they are t I think they want to work on the second stream also , but more with some kind of multi - band or , well , what they call TRAP or generalized TRAP . Do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be ? the next  phd f: It 's  in June . Yeah , the other thing is that you saw that that mail about  the VAD V A Ds performing quite differently ? That that  So  . This there was this experiment of  \" what if we just take the baseline ? \" phd f: Mmm . professor a: set  of features , just mel cepstra , and you inc incorporate the different V A And it looks like the the French VAD is actually  better significantly better . If the use the small VAD I th I think it 's on I think it 's easy to do better because it doesn't work at all . He Actually , I think that he say with the good VAD of from OGI and with the Alcatel VAD . phd f: Yeah but I it 's  I think you were talking about the other mail that used VAD on the reference features . professor a:  it was enough better that that it would  account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance , actually . phd f: And perhaps we can easily improve if if we put like mean normalization before the before the VAD . professor a: H Hynek will be back in town  the week after next , back back in the country . phd d: Also is Stephane was thinking that maybe it was useful to f to think about  voiced - unvoiced phd f:   phd f: Yeah , my feeling is that  actually when we look at all the proposals , ev everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope professor a: Right . phd f: Yeah , well , not pitch , but to look at the  fine at the at the high re high resolution spectrum . We don't necessarily want to find the the pitch of the of the sound but  Cuz I have a feeling that when we look when we look at the just at the envelope there is no way you can tell if it 's voiced and unvoiced , if there is some It 's it 's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency and . phd f:  there is the first formant , which is the larger and then voiced sound are more high frequencies cuz it 's frication and professor a: Right . When you have noise there is no  if if you have a low frequency noise it could be taken for for voiced speech and . professor a: but but phd b: Isn't there some other phd f: S phd b:  d phd f: So I think that it it would be good Yeah , yeah , well , go go on . phd b: I was just gonna say isn't there aren't aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity , or speech - nonspeech rather ,  by looking at  , you know ,  I guess harmonics or looking across time professor a: Well , I think he was talking about the voiced - unvoiced , though , phd f: Mmm . phd b:  w ah you know ,  even with the voiced - non voiced - unvoiced phd f: Mmm . phd f:  yeah , so yeah , I think if we try to develop a second stream well , there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second , it could be interesting to have that 's something that 's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum . We were thinking about like using ideas from from Larry Saul , have a good voice detector , have a good , well , voiced - speech detector , that 's working on on the FFT and  professor a: U phd f: Larry Saul could be an idea . We were are thinking about just kind of  taking the spectrum and computing the variance of of the high resolution spectrum and things like this .  we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on  making use of voicing information  to help in reducing the noise . phd f: Yeah ? professor a: So what he was doing is basically y you you do estimate the pitch . professor a: And  you from that you you estimate or you estimate fine harmonic structure , whichev ei either way , it 's more or less the same . But  the thing is that  you then can get rid of things that are not i if there is strong harmonic structure , you can throw away stuff that 's that 's non - harmonic . professor a: And that that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise phd f: Yeah . It was kind of like RASTA was taking care of convolutional stuff phd f: Mmm . We 've actually back when Chuck was here we did some voiced - unvoiced  classification using a bunch of these , phd f: But professor a: and and  works OK . professor a: But the thing is that you can't given the constraints of this task , we can't , in a very nice way , feed forward to the recognizer the information the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it 's voiced or unvoiced , where w we can't you know affect the the  distributions or anything . phd b: Didn't the head dude send around that message ? Yeah , I think you sent us all a copy of the message , where he was saying that I I 'm not sure , exactly , what the gist of what he was saying , but something having to do with the voice activity detector and that it will that people shouldn't put their own in or something . professor a: I guess what you could do , maybe this would be w useful , if if you have if you view the second stream , yeah , before you before you do KLT 's and so forth , if you do view it as probabilities , and if it 's an independent So , if it 's if it 's  not so much envelope - based by fine - structure - based ,  looking at harmonicity or something like that ,  if you get a probability from that information and then multiply it by you know , multiply by all the voiced outputs and all the unvoiced outputs , you know , then use that as the phd f:   professor a:  take the log of that or  pre pre  pre - nonlinearity , phd f: Yeah . i if professor a:  and do the KLT on the on on that , phd f: Yeah . And then that would be phd f: Yeah , well , I was not thinking this yeah , this could be an yeah So you mean have some kind of probability for the v the voicing professor a: R Right . If you have a tandem system and then you have some kind of it can be pretty small net phd f:   professor a: and the and and you use the thing is to use information primarily that 's different as you say , it 's more fine - structure - based than than envelope - based phd f:   professor a:  so then it you you you can pretty much guarantee it 's stuff that you 're not looking at very well with the other one , and  then you only use for this one distinction . professor a: And and so now you 've got a probability of the cases , and you 've got  the probability of the finer  categories on the other side . professor a: if they really are from independent information sources then they should have different kinds of errors phd f:   professor a: and roughly independent errors , and it 's a good choice for phd f:   Because , yeah , well , spectral subtraction is good and we could u we could use the fine structure to to have a better estimate of the noise but still there is this issue with spectral subtraction that it seems to increase the variance of of of professor a: Yeah . phd f:  Well it 's this musical noise which is annoying if you d you do some kind of on - line normalization after . Spectral subtraction and on - line normalization don't seem to to go together very well . I professor a: Or if you do a spectral subtraction do some spectral subtraction first and then do some on - line normalization then do some more spectral subtraction  , maybe maybe you can do it layers or something so it doesn't doesn't hurt too much or something . professor a: But it but  , anyway I think I was sort of arguing against myself there by giving that example phd f: Yeah . professor a:   cuz I was already sort of suggesting that we should be careful about not spending too much time on exactly what they 're doing In fact if you get if you go into  a  harmonics - related thing it 's definitely going to be different than what they 're doing and   phd f:   I know that when have people have done  sort of the obvious thing of taking  your feature vector and adding in some variables which are pitch related or  that it hasn't my impression it hasn't particularly helped . professor a: But I think  that 's that 's a question for this  you know extending the feature vector versus having different streams . Was it nois noisy condition ? the example that you you just professor a: And and it may not have been noisy conditions . I I don't remember the example but it was it was on some DARPA data and some years ago and so it probably wasn't , actually phd f:   But we were thinking , we discussed with Barry about this , and perhaps thinking we were thinking about some kind of sheet cheating experiment where we would use TIMIT professor a:  - huh . phd f: and see if giving the d  , this voicing bit would help in in terms of  frame classification . professor a: Why don't you why don't you just do it with Aurora ? phd f: Mmm . professor a: Just any i in in each in each frame phd f: Yeah , but but B but we cannot do the cheating , this cheating thing . Cuz we don't have Well , for Italian perhaps we have , but we don't have this labeling for Aurora . professor a: But you could  you can you can align so that It 's not perfect , but if you if you know what was said and phd b: But the problem is that their models are all word level models . phd b: You So you could find out where the word boundaries are but that 's about it . grad e: S But we could use  the the noisy version that TIMIT , which you know , is similar to the the noises found in the TI - digits  portion of Aurora . phd f: Well , I guess I guess we can we can say that it will help , but I don't know . If this voicing bit doesn't help , I think we don't have to to work more about this because professor a:  . professor a: and different ta it was probably Resource Management or something , I think you were getting something like still eight or nine percent error on the voicing , as I recall . professor a: what that said is that , sort of , left to its own devices , like without the a strong language model and so forth , that you would you would make significant number of errors just with your  probabilistic machinery in deciding phd b: It also professor a: one oh phd b: Yeah , the though I think  there was one problem with that in that , you know , we used canonical mapping so our truth may not have really been true to the acoustics . Well back twenty years ago when I did this voiced - unvoiced stuff , we were getting more like ninety - seven or ninety - eight percent correct in voicing . professor a: And we did this complex feature selection thing where we looked at all the different possible features one could have for voicing and and and  and exhaustively searched all size subsets and and  for for that particular speaker and you 'd find you know the five or six features which really did well on them . professor a: And then doing doing all of that we could get down to two or three percent error . professor a: So I would I would believe that  it was quite likely that  looking at envelope only , that we 'd be significantly worse than that . phd f: And the all the the SpeechCorders ? what 's the idea behind ? Cuz they they have to Oh , they don't even have to detect voiced spe speech ? professor a: The modern ones don't do a a simple switch . phd f: They just work on the code book professor a: They work on the code book excitation . They try they they try every every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best . One of the ideas that we had come up with last week for things to try to improve the system  . Actually I I s we didn't I guess I wrote this in after the meeting b but the thought I had was  looking at the language model that 's used in the HTK recognizer , which is basically just a big loop , grad e:   phd b: and then that can be either go to silence or go to another digit , which That model would allow for the production of infinitely long sequences of digits , right ? professor a: Right . I thought \" well I 'm gonna just look at the what actual digit strings do occur in the training data . phd b: And the interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of two - long or three - long digit strings in any of the Aurora training data . So it 's either one , four , five , six ,  up to eleven , and then it skips and then there 's some at sixteen . So I I just for the heck of it , I made a little grammar which  , you know , had it 's separate path for each length digit string you could get . So there was a one - long path and there was a four - long and a five - long professor a:   phd b: So it was you know , I I didn't have any weights of these paths or I didn't have anything like that . phd b: And I played with tweaking the word transition penalties a bunch , but I couldn't go anywhere . I thought \" well if I only allow \" Yeah , I guess I should have looked at to see how often there was a mistake where a two - long or a three - long path was actually put out as a hypothesis . phd b: So to do that right you 'd probably want to have allow for them all but then have weightings and things <doc-sep>We  we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too not too hot , not too cold , they were you know , they were  , far enough away that you got more background noise , and  and so forth phd a:  - huh . professor c: but they weren't so close that they got quite the you know , the really good No , th phd a: OK . They were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes , phd a:  - huh . professor c: but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference . On the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice , precisely because it 's in the middle . professor c: There 's  , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel  , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we there seemed to be very strong opinions for  , getting rid of lapels . phd a: The mike number is professor c: So , phd f: your mike number 's written on the back of that unit there . phd f: It - it 's one less than what 's written on the back of your phd a: OK . professor c: And you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations . phd f: So what we usually do is  , we typically will have our meetings professor c: Yeah . One thing phd f: Sunil 's here for the summer ? professor c: Sunil 's here for the summer , right .  , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe  , and then just  , I guess  , progress reports individually , and then  , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . phd f: I could say a few words about  , some of the  , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . professor c: Yeah ? phd f: We  So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , to use as sort of a compute farm . And  , we ordered  , SUN - Blade - one - hundreds , and  , I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , in addition , we 're running So the plan for using these is , we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all  , fixed up and up to speed . And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to  , run things using P - make and Customs . The simplest thing And I can send an email around or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something .  , professor c: How about an email that points to the FAQ , phd f: there 's a c professor c: you know what I 'm saying ? phd f: Yeah , yeah . And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and  and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . So you can say \" run dash command L S \" , and , it 'll actually export that LS command to some machine in the institute , and  , do an LS on your current directory . So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , and  And that 's a simple way to get started using using this . And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . Now th one of the nice things is that  , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it .  , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . So , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and  , right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're  . professor c: So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , phd f: So . Yeah , you know , I I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently and  ,  I fired off a training job , and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , \"  , are you running two trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . grad g: I have I have a question about the  , parallelization ? phd f:   grad g: So , let 's say I have like , a thousand little little jobs to do ? phd f:   grad g: how do I do it with \" run command \" ?  do phd f: You could write a script  , which called run command on each sub - job grad g:  - huh . A thousand times ? phd f: right ? But you probably wanna be careful with that grad g: OK .  , so , you know , you should you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , just because then it would keep other people grad g: Oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f: Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . phd f: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \" , to only have ten of those going at a time .  , professor c: I remember I I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or or Hopkins workshop , I remember one of the workshops I was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out . professor c: So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines phd f:   professor c: and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . phd f: but  , you can also If you have that level of parallelization  , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in in a Perl script to take care of that , you can use  , P - make grad g: Just do P - make . phd f: and and you basically write a Make file that  , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things , grad g: s   phd f: and when you run P - make , on your Make file , you can give it the dash capital J and and then a number , grad g:   If you \" Run command \" , that I mentioned before , is doesn't know about other things that you might be running . phd f: So , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once , phd d: Right . But if you use P - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run phd d:   professor c: So \" run command \" doesn't use P - make , or ? phd f: It uses \" export \" underlyingly . But , if you i It 's meant to be run one job at a time ? So you could fire off a thousand of those , and it doesn't know any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running . professor c: So why would one use that rather than P - make ? phd f: Well , if you have ,  Like , for example ,  if you didn't wanna write a P - make script and you just had a ,  an HTK training job that you know is gonna take  , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , the machine you typically use , you can say \" run command \" and your HTK thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and and run your job there . professor c: Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it phd f: Yes . And if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from . phd f: But , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and and they were at lunch , professor c:   phd f: they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted your job will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . So which can cause you to lose time , right ? If you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . If you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus the attribute , you know , \" no evict \" , and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . professor c: what what about I remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? phd f:   professor c: and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? phd f: Yeah , I I 'm not sure how that works . I don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console TTY , so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev dev console or something . phd f:  ? professor c:  you sort of you 're at home and you 're trying to log in , and it takes forever to even log you in , and you probably go , \" screw this \" , phd f: Yeah , yeah . phd a: I need a little orientation about this environment and  scr s how to run some jobs here because I never d did anything so far with this X emissions phd f: OK . Yeah , and and also  , Stephane 's a a really good resource for that if you can't find me . Well , why don't we  , Sunil since you 're haven't haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's what 's up with you ? Wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully . phd a: yeah , after the submission the what I 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in in ours . And then I found that  , if if I combine it with LDA , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . I just plug in I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that . phd a: What I did was I took the LDA filter 's design using clean speech , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , narrow narrow band LDA filter that we submitted  , I got new filters . And  , so then after after that I I added  , on - line normalization also on top of that . And that there there also I n I found that I have to make some changes to their time constant that I used because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . But  , I didn't I didn't play with that time constant a lot , I just t g I just found that I have to reduce the value  , I have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . And  , the other other thing what I tried was , I just  , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf  th information , just the Aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the  the w speech and nonspeech . And  , I found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c: can you back up a second , I I I missed something , I guess my mind wandered . Ad - ad When you added the on - line normalization and so forth ,  things got better again ? phd a: Yeah . phd a: With the different time constant I found that  , I didn't get an improvement over not using on - line normalization , professor c: Oh . phd a: But I didn't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than . The the other thing what I tried was the adding the  , endpoint information to the baseline and that itself gives like twenty - two percent because the the second the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech . And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information , I just , use professor c:  . phd f: So people won't even have to worry about , doing speech - nonspeech then . professor c: G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway , phd f: I see . professor c: and they wanted to see , given that you 're doing that , what what are the best features that you should use . professor c: But but it might be  In some ways it might be better t to rather than giving the endpoints , to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with . phd f: So , are people supposed to assume that there is  Are are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints ? phd a:  phd f: Or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things ? phd a: No . Like y you will you will You 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech but the whole speech is available to you . professor c: So it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better , phd a: Yeah . I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases , that like , the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint . phd a: Yeah , so professor c: But but phd a: so that is when  , the the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched . And  , Yeah , I guess after that , I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks . phd a: Ye Yeah , and I I came back and I started working on  , some other speech enhancement algorithm .  , so I from the submission what I found that people have tried spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering . phd a: so just to just to fill the space with some f few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot , I I 've been working on this  , signal subspace approach for speech enhancement where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s and the noise subspace and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace . phd a: So , I 've been actually running some s So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab . phd a: and then I 'll p port it to C and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result . professor c: S So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second . So so now you 're you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here phd a: Yeah . Cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week , I guess ? phd d:   professor c: where you were also combining something both of you I guess were both combining something from the  , French Telecom system with the u  phd d: Right . professor c: I I don't know whether it was system one or system two , or ? phd d:   phd d: we The main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the France Telecom , which provide us some speech samples that are  , with noise removed . So then , one distinction is that  , you were taking the actual France Telecom features and then applying something to phd a: no there is a slight different .   , which are extracted at the handset because they had another back - end blind equalization professor c: Yeah . professor c: What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something , right ? phd a: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . But I guess it 's the s exactly the same thing because on the heads  , handset they just applied this Wiener filter and then compute cepstral features , phd a: Yeah , the cepstral f The difference is like There may be a slight difference in the way phd d: right ? or ? phd a: because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech . But  , I th phd d: Yeah , well I think we should  , have a table with all the result because I don't know I  , I don't exactly know what are your results ? But , phd a: OK . Yeah , but so we did this , and another difference I guess is that we just applied  , proposal - one system after this without well , with our modification to reduce the delay of the the LDA filters , phd a:  - huh . phd d: and phd b: And the filter phd d: Well there are slight modifications , but it was the full proposal - one . In your case , if you tried just putting LDA , then maybe on - line normalization ? phd a: Only LDA . So we just tried directly to to just , keep the system as it was and , when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves  , signif significantly .  , but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization . phd d: Because if we keep the value that was submitted  , it doesn't help at all . But , you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere , and we don't know where exactly phd a: Yeah . professor c: So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something phd d: Right . professor c: and see where i where the where they were different and what we can learn from it . phd d: because we change it the system to have phd a: Oh yeah ,  the the new LDA filters . There are other things that we finally were shown to improve also like , the sixty - four hertz cut - off . phd d: And , right now if we look at the results , it 's , always better than it seems always better than France Telecom for mismatch and high - mismatch . But , the problem is that it 's not significant , but if you put this in the , mmm , spreadsheet , it 's still worse . I don't think it 's importa important because when they will change their metric , mainly because of  , when you p you plug the  , frame dropping in the baseline system , it will improve a lot HM , and  , phd a: Yeah . phd a: Because the your improvement on HM and  will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet so . phd a:  the well - matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information . But they d the everything  is like , but there that 's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on . professor c: But are they changing the weighting ? phd a: no , I guess they are going ahead with the same weighting . professor c: I guess I I haven't been part of the discussion , so , it seems to me that the well - matched condition is gonna be unusual , phd a: Usual . professor c: Because , you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ particular person 's car is like , or phd a: Mmm . phd a: Yeah , but actually the well well the well - matched  ,  the the well - matched condition is not like , the one in TI - digits where  , you have all the training , conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also . The well - matched has also some some mismatch in that which is other than the professor c: The well wa matched has mismatch ? phd a: has has also some slight mismatches , unlike the TI - digits where it 's like prefectly matched phd f: Perfect to match . So remind me of what well - matched meant ? phd a: The the well - matched is like professor c: You 've told me many times . phd a: the the well - matched is defined like it 's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing . phd a: It 's it 's phd d: Because it phd a: OK , it 's professor c: Yeah . So , yeah , unless they deliberately chose it to be different , which they didn't because they want it to be well - matched , it is pretty much You know , so it 's so it 's sort of saying if you phd f: It 's it 's not guaranteed though . phd a: the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually . professor c: Again , if you have enough if you have enough phd a: No yeah , yeah . professor c: So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK , so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , you you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , and then I don't think that 's very realistic ,  I th phd a:   professor c: I I you know , so I I I you know , I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially , that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars , and and you would have something that was roughly similar and maybe that 's the argument , but I 'm not sure I buy it , so . We are playing we are also playing , trying to put other spectral subtraction mmm , in the code .  , it would be a very simple spectral subtraction , on the  , mel energies which I already tested but without the  frame dropping actually , and I think it 's important to have frame dropping if you use spectral subtraction . phd f: Is it is spectral subtraction typically done on the after the mel , scaling or is it done on the FFT bins ? phd d: phd f: Does it matter , or ? phd d: I d I don't know . So - some of the proposal , we 're doing this on the bin on the FFT bins , phd f:  . You can do both , but I cannot tell you what 's which one might be better or I phd f:  . phd a: I guess if you want to reconstruct the speech , it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bins .  it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT . phd d: Well , it gives something different , but I don't know what are the , pros and cons of both . phd a: The other thing is like when you 're putting in a speech enhancement technique , is it like one stage speech enhancement ? Because everybody seems to have a mod two stages of speech enhancement in all the proposals , which is really giving them some improvement . phd a: And So , there 's something that is good about doing it  , to cleaning it up once more . phd a: so we can phd d: So maybe in my implementation I should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing phd a: Yeah . That 's what professor c: Well , the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing . professor c:  maybe one or one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first . So , professor c: Right , so he 's doing a signal subspace thing , maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction , or maybe vi maybe the other way around , phd d: Yeah ,   professor c: you know ? phd a: So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace , phd d:   phd a:  just to see all some some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not . professor c: How is it I I guess I 'm ignorant about this , how does  , since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're that you 're adding together the two signals , how is how is that differ from signal subspace ? phd a: The signal subspace ? The professor c: Yeah . phd a: So , the the different the c the the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad . So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction , followed by a KL transform , followed by a phd a: Wiener filtering . Yeah , in general , you don't that 's right you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy .  , that was something that  , Herve and I were talking about with  , the multi - band stuff , that if you 're converting things to from  , bands , groups of bands into cepstral coef you know , local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it 's not that great to do it if it 's noisy . phd a: So that that 's one reason maybe we could combine s some something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage , professor c: Yeah . phd d: What was your point about about colored noise there ? phd a: Oh , the colored noise  phd d: Yeah . phd a: the colored noise the the v the signal subspace approach has  , it it actually depends on inverting the matrices . phd a:  it has a it 's It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite ak It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite . phd a: So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering , first of the colo colored noise professor c: Yeah . phd a: and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again .  if you sort of you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid phd a: Yeah . professor c: and then you then then add a little bit l noise noise addition  , that sort of what J JRASTA does , in a way . professor c: If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it 's equivalent to sort of adding a little adding a little noise , phd a: Huh ?  - huh . And maybe we well we find some people so that  , agree to maybe work with us , and they have implementation of VTS techniques so it 's  , Vector Taylor Series that are used to mmm ,  f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra . Well , if you take the standard model of channel plus noise , it 's it 's a nonlinear eh  , transformation in the cepstral domain . phd d: And  , there is a way to approximate this using  , first - order or second - order Taylor Series and it can be used for  , getting rid of the noise and the channel effect . professor c: Who is doing this ? phd d:  w working in the cepstral domain ? So there is one guy in Grenada , phd b: Yeah , in Grenada one of my friend . professor c: Who 's the guy in Grenada ? phd d: phd b: Jose Carlos Segura . professor c: Yeah , so at any rate , you 're looking general , standing back from it , looking at ways to combine one form or another of  , noise removal , with with these other things we have , phd d:   But for sure there 's required to that requires to re - check everything else , and re - optimize the other things professor c: Oh yeah .  , professor c: Well one of the seems like one of the things to go through next week when Hari 's here , phd d: I professor c: cuz Hari 'll have his own ideas too or I guess not next week , phd d:  - huh . professor c: week and a half , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans .  one would be , you look at a few things very quickly , you pick on something that looks like it 's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing . Another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things , and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better , phd d:   professor c: and then , you know , but , w  , he 'll have some ideas on that too . phd a: The other thing is to ,  Most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks . But we we going to address this Wall Street Journal in our next stage , which is also going to be a noisy task so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all . So , there are some  , I was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks and spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks . And it 's Always people have shown improvement with Wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere . But if we if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization to make it work @ @ . professor c: So they 're making there Somebody 's generating Wall Street Journal with additive artificially added noise or something ? phd a: Yeah , yeah . professor c: Sort of a sort of like what they did with TI - digits , and ? phd a: Yeah . professor c: And then they 're they 're  , generating HTK scripts to phd a: Yeah . There are they have there is no I don't know if they are converging on HTK or are using some Mississippi State , professor c: Mis - Mississippi State maybe , phd a: yeah . professor c: well we 've Yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too . But for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in Broadcast News . professor c: and some of the focus conditions were noisy and and phd a: It had additive n professor c: But we but we didn't do spectral subtraction . We were doing our funny stuff , right ? We were doing multi multi  , multi - stream and and so forth . professor c: and and  , that we have  , for the  , the quote - unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually . And that 's what most o again , most of our work has been done with that , with with  , connected digits . professor c: but  , we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech , large vocabulary continuous speech , using Switchboard  , Switchboard recognizer , phd a: Yeah . You just take the Switchboard trained ? Yeah , professor c: That 's that 's what we 're doing , phd a: yeah . professor c: but we 're hop  , actually  , Dave and I were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future , trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on , some of the large vocabulary data .  , I guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using  , the SRI recognizer and , phd f: I don't not that I know of . professor c: You 'll see a little smoke coming up from the the CPU or something trying to trying to do it , phd f: That 's right professor c: but  , yeah . But , you 're right that that that 's a real good point , that  , we we don't know yeah , what if any of these ta I guess that 's why they 're pushing that in the  in the evaluation . Anything else going on ? at you guys ' end , phd b: I don't have good result , with the inc including the new parameters , professor c: or ? phd b: I don't have good result . phd a: With what what other new p new parameter ? grad g: You 're talking about your voicing ? professor c: Yeah . professor c: seeing as how Sunil , phd b: I tried to include another new parameter to the traditional parameter , professor c: yeah . phd b: that , like , the auto - correlation , the R - zero and R - one over R - zero phd a:   phd b: and another estimation of the var the variance of the difference for of the spec si  , spectrum of the signal and and the spectrum of time after filt mel filter bank . phd b: and you have the on the other side you have the output of the mel filter bank . phd b: You can extend the coefficient of the mel filter bank and obtain an approximation of the spectrum of the signal . phd b: because , suppose we we think that if the variance is high , maybe you have n  , noise . phd b: To to To The idea is to found another feature for discriminate between voice sound and unvoice sound . And I did experiment I need to change to obtain this new feature I need to change the size the window size size . phd b: And I do I did two type of experiment to include this feature directly with the with the other feature and to train a neural network to select it voice - unvoice - silence silence phd a: Unvoiced . It 's neve e e sometime it 's worse , sometime it 's a little bit better , but not significantly . phd a: is it with TI - digits , or with ? phd b: And No , I work with eh , Italian and Spanish basically . phd b: And if I don't y use the neural network , and use directly the feature the results are worse . professor c:  we 've had these discussions before , and and one of the things that struck me was that  , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we  whenever you condense things , in an irreversible way , you throw away some information . And , that 's mostly viewed on as a good thing , in the way we use it , because we wanna suppress things that will cause variability for  particular , phonetic units . And so the question is , can we figure out if there 's something we 've thrown away that we shouldn't have . So , when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank , I was thinking \" oh , OK , so they 're picking on something they 're looking on it to figure out noise , or voice voiced property whatever . But for me sort of the interesting thing was , \" well , but is there just something in that difference which is useful ? \" So another way of doing it , maybe , would be just to take the FFT  , power spectrum , and feed it into a neural network , phd b: To know professor c: and then use it , you know , in combination , or alone , or or whatever phd f: Wi - with what targets ? phd a: Voiced , unvoiced is like professor c: no . professor c: No the just the same same way we 're using  , the same way that we 're using the filter bank . And , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing . And maybe , you know , using , orth you know , KLT , or  , adding probabilities , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here . professor c: Well , that 's probably why y i it would be unlikely to work as well by itself , but it might help in combination . professor c: But I I I have to tell you , I can't remember the conference , but , I think it 's about ten years ago , I remember going to one of the speech conferences and and  , I saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something , and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to  , just putting in the FFT and the FFT did slightly better . professor c: but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that a that variability , and you know , doing something reasonable with it . professor c: So , It - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about  , you know , we have these data driven filters , in LDA , and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gonna be the same in training and test , so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things , and in some ways it 's bad to have data driven things . So , phd a: Yeah , d professor c: part of what we 're discovering , is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not . professor c: so anyway , it 's just a thought , that that if we if we had that maybe it 's just a baseline  , which would show us \" well , what are we really getting out of the filters \" , or maybe i i probably not by itself , but in combination , phd d:   professor c: you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , and let the But , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time , maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information . phd a: What one one  p one thing is like what before we started using this VAD in this Aurora , the th what we did was like , I I guess most of you know about this , adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the  on that . phd a: That is just a binary feature and that seems to be improving a lot on the SpeechDat - Car where there is a lot of noise but not much on the TI - digits . So , a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping . phd d: Wait I I 'm sorry ? phd a: Yeah , we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum , just the baseline . Well , in in the case of TI - digits it didn't actually give us anything , because there wasn't any f anything to discriminate between speech , phd d: Yeah . But anyway the question is even more , is within speech , can we get some features ? Are we drop dropping information that can might be useful within speech , phd a: OK . professor c: And it 's particularly more relevant now since we 're gonna be given the endpoints . phd a: There was a paper in ICASSP this ICASSP over the  extracting some higher - order  , information from the cepstral coefficients and I forgot the name . Some is some harmonics I don't know , I can I can pull that paper out from ICASSP . phd a: It wa it was taking the ,  It was about finding the higher - order moments of Yeah . professor c: Yeah , phd a: And I 'm not sure about whether it is the higher - order moments , or professor c: cumulants , yeah . professor c: Yeah , but again You could argue that th that 's exactly what the neural network does . professor c: So n neural network  , is in some sense equivalent to computing , you know , higher - order moments of what you phd a: trying to f to Moments , yeah . I can I can just  , share a little bit Sunil hasn't hasn't heard about  , what I 've been doing . grad g: so , I told you I was I was I was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam . So basically that 's just , trying to propose  , your next your your following years of of your PHD work , trying trying to find a project to to define and and to work on . So , I 've been , looking into , doing something about r  , speech recognition using acoustic events . So , the idea is you have all these these different events , for example voicing , nasality , R - coloring , you know burst or noise , frication , that kinda stuff , building robust  , primary detectors for these acoustic events , and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition .  , and , these these primary detectors , will be , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , doing things , similar to Larry Saul 's work on , graphical models to to detect these these , acoustic events . And , so I I been I been thinking about that and some of the issues that I 've been running into are , exactly what what kind of acoustic events I need , what  , what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps . And , also , once I decide a set of acoustic events , h how do I how do I get labels ? Training data for for these acoustic events . And , then later on down the line , I can start playing with the the models themselves , the the primary detectors .  , so , I kinda see like , after after building the primary detectors I see  , myself taking the outputs and feeding them in , sorta tandem style into into a  , Gaussian mixtures  back - end , and doing recognition . grad g: professor c: By by the way , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what Carmen was looking at . professor c: you know , if you if a multi - band approach was helpful as as I think it is , it seems to be helpful for determining voiced - unvoiced , grad g:   And so , this this past week  , I 've been  , looking a little bit into  , TRAPS  , and doing doing TRAPS on on these e events too , just , seeing seeing if that 's possible .  , and  , other than that , I was kicked out of I - house for living there for four years . professor c: or , no ? grad g: well , s s som something like that . professor c: Suni - i d ' you v did  did you find a place ? phd a: no professor c: Is that out of the way ? phd a: not yet .  , yesterday I called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from May thirtieth and she said she 's interviewing two more people . And then , you 're coming back  phd a: i  , I I p I plan to be here on thirty - first . professor c: Thirty - first , phd a: Yeah , well if there 's a house available or place to professor c: OK . professor c: They 're available , and they 'll be able to get you something , so worst comes to worst we 'll put you up in a hotel for for for a while phd a: Yeah . grad e: You know , if you 're in a desperate situation and you need a place to stay , you could stay with me for a while . professor c: Do y wanna say anything about You you actually been  , last week you were doing this stuff with Pierre , you were you were mentioning . Is that that something worth talking about , or ? grad e: it 's Well , it I don't think it directly relates .  , well , so , I was helping a speech researcher named Pierre Divenyi and he 's int He wanted to  , look at  , how people respond to formant changes , I think . So he he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel - to - vowel transitions , and then he wanted a psycho - acoustic  , spectrum . And he wanted to look at  , how the energy is moving over time in that spectrum and compare that to the to the listener tests . And to  he he t wanted to track the peaks so he could look at how they 're moving . I found the roots of the  , LPC polynomial to , track the peaks in the , PLP LPC spectra . phd a: well there is aligned spectral pairs , is like the the Is that the aligned s professor c: It 's a r root LPC , of some sort . phd a: Oh , it 's like line sp professor c: Except I think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle , don't they , phd a: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . But what we 'd used to do w when I did synthesis at National Semiconductor twenty years ago , the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the LPC polynomial and and  , finding the roots . It wasn't PLP cuz Hynek hadn't invented it yet , but it was just LPC , and  , we found the roots of the polynomial , And th When you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants , sometimes they 're not . professor c:  Formant tracking with it can be a little tricky cuz you get these funny values in in real speech , phd f: So you just You typically just get a few roots ? professor c: but . phd f: something like that ? professor c: And it depends on the order that you 're doing , but . So , if @ @ Every root that 's Since it 's a real signal , the LPC polynomial 's gonna have real coefficients . So I think that means that every root that is not a real root is gonna be a c complex pair , phd f:   So for each And if you look at that on the unit circle , one of these one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency , one will be a negative frequency , I think . So I just So , f for the I 'm using an eighth - order polynomial and I 'll get three or four of these pairs professor c: Yeah .  for real speech in real then what you end up having is , like I say , funny little things that are don't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well . grad e: Mmm , professor c: And and what  in in what we were doing , which was not so much looking at things , it was OK phd d: I professor c: because it was just a question of quantization .  , we were just you know , storing It was We were doing , stored speech , quantization . professor c: But but  , in your case  , you know phd d: Actually you have peaks that are not at the formant 's positions , but they are lower in energy grad e: But there 's some of that , yes . phd f: If this is synthetic speech can't you just get the formants directly ?  h how is the speech created ? grad e: It was created from a synthesizer , and  phd f: Wasn't a formant synthesizer was it ? professor c: I bet it it might have may have been grad e: I d d this professor c: but maybe he didn't have control over it or something ? grad e: In in fact w we we could get , formant frequencies out of the synthesizer , as well . And , w one thing that the , LPC approach will hopefully give me in addition , is that I I might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well . grad e: but I don't think there 's a g a really good reason not to  , get the formant frequencies from the synthesizer instead . professor c: Yeah , so the actual So you 're not getting the actual formants per se . professor c: You 're getting something that is is  , af strongly affected by the PLP model . So it 's a little It 's It 's It 's sort of sort of a different thing . i Ordinarily , in a formant synthesizer , the bandwidths as well as the ban  , formant centers are phd f: Yeah . professor c: that 's Somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in , as as what you grad e:   professor c: But but yeah , you view each complex pair as essentially a second - order section , which has , band center and band width , and  ,  But . So , yeah , you 're going back today and then back in a week I guess , phd a: Yeah "

        "Query": "What were the thoughts of the Project Manager and the Industrial Designer regarding the energy source for the project, and why was the idea of using solar energy rejected?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager expressed a preference for a disposable remote control that does not have a battery compartment and relies on predetermined battery life. The idea of using permanent batteries was also proposed. On the other hand, the Industrial Designer initially suggested rechargeable energy sources and later proposed a combination of solar and conventional batteries. This would allow the remote to use light as an energy source during the day and switch to the battery at night. However, the convenience of solar energy at night and the cost implications were questioned by the Industrial Designer.",
        "Article": " I'll briefly go through the  notes of the of the last meeting  just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and  n nobody's working equally , user interface: Sorry .  we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the  b a boring shape and boring colour .  and and we s we saw that the  what we needed to do was to to make sure the device  controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at  anything in particular ,  that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .  should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it ,  illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms .  before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that  the the management have placed on us and  will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting .  the  the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and  the they don't necessarily agree with with what we  we thought .  and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device  actually b carrying out , and we have  forty minutes to do this in and I  Anyway . Now , the n the new requirements are  the the management team see that  teletext is no longer of any importance given the  the rise of the internet .  now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s ,  satellite boxes , which   we saw as being fundamental to the  to the exercise .  and on that basis  I I think we we need to bear that in mind ,  but possibly  keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they  no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things .  the the logo  being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against  a yellow background .  now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market .  it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway .  but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which    is is is their choice , but   we we need to talk that through .  okay , so  after the meeting it'll be summarised and  industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  notes sent out and  etcetera .  again I there is no order of precedence here  so I I I'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ? marketing:  I don't mind . project manager: marketing: I got a how do I start there ? project manager: Oh , if you click on the   the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what  is needed by people and what they want to see .  everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff .  along with  looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be  more cost effective and we can put the price up . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as  they they don't  they , yeah , they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was   th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . I took to mean that they just they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume . And  yeah ,  I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause  wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but  oh and we're going to see  on the  that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user . marketing: I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . And  , yep , the  time taken to learn new remote controls is  don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for  new like first time users and stuff . And  repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . project manager: Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . It also asked  if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition project manager: marketing: and younger people say they would . And  there was another section on our on the report for  L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . project manager: Yeah , I must say that  the  I c can't remember what  f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked  remarkably well , so that is indeed a   a thought marketing: And  it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you project manager: and it it cuts out  I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , industrial designer: project manager: j just get jaw ache . marketing: Yeah ,  oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design .  functionality ,  like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily user interface: It could be oh  I was just gonna say  maybe like the flip phones that they use ? industrial designer:  . user interface: that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , marketing: Oh yeah . project manager: If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all  remove them altogether . marketing: Just remove them completely ? project manager: We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with  user interface: That might be the project manager: I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that  the  now the the age structure we were looking at   w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . project manager: Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group ,  to put myself right in the middle of it ,  u use remote controls to a great extent . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: Yes we marketing:  no this is for pay more for speech recognition . So , we're looking at  well again , we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups . project manager: If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . industrial designer: P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . project manager: But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ industrial designer: It might marketing: Or even  you could even just have it left on . user interface: Maybe i marketing: You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to user interface: Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box project manager: user interface: and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , industrial designer:  . project manager: It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , industrial designer:  . project manager: because if somebody actually on the television says   , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might  change itself , marketing: B_B_C_ one . marketing: project manager: so it probably needs to be  possibly actually need a button on it user interface: Yeah , that's true . project manager: Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then user interface: Yeah . project manager: marketing: Relevance of two out of ten , project manager: Vol volume , marketing: yeah . project manager: yes  industrial designer: They're not used often project manager: th industrial designer: but they are quite important when they're used . And  I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment ,  the channel and volume industrial designer:  . project manager: and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . So if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different ,  incorporates the the logo and and the colours and  we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey ,  and  I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . marketing:  you were saying about  it could technical problems of like  someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed project manager: marketing: 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , project manager: Depe  i depends whether  industrial designer:  . project manager: if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say marketing: Oh I see . marketing:  I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . project manager:  and I I I s so I suppose one  could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . Do you want to just carry on with marketing: Oh no project manager: or marketing: I I interrupted you , project manager: no no , no  b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on  a remote  that looks better , combined with  decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might  turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it  marketing: Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , project manager: 'cause we're marketing: we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . marketing: So  yeah , if we could  power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really project manager: The  the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . project manager: No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it  , you know , visually very distinctive . Okay , who sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? marketing:  yeah , yeah , that's everything . marketing: Do you want the cable ? user interface: Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . user interface: So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and  identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . This one  this is the user centred , it has  quite a few    fewer buttons marketing: user interface: and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , project manager: user interface: and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the  logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know , fewer buttons .  we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , project manager: yeah . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark ,  the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . project manager: Okay , can I  I'm actually gonna use the  it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . industrial designer: Oh yeah , they're all they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em . project manager: Yes , rather than the  the the traditional in fact ,  I won't even go that far .  something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape ,  that you you sort of hold in your hand , well I'm trying to think    l  l such as   something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , you know , the  the infrared or whatever source . project manager:  so that you know , it's flying off in all directions , industrial designer:  . project manager: so that    again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of  actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the  such a source ,  you know , compromise the our our need for  you know , it it being   permanently  you know , available . industrial designer: project manager:  whether whether different technology   th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time .  we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different ,  you know , short range , not like the old  radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours .  industrial designer: user interface: project manager: but   I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off .  so that it can al it could  almost end up like that , but again , except that  you know the risk of losing it .  anyway okay  so Kate , wh what are your  your thoughts on this ? industrial designer: Yes ,  . industrial designer: Which one does this plug into ? user interface:  I think it's all there . user interface: H industrial designer: I can't did you could you see it on you screen when it user interface: Oh yeah .  the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever . marketing: industrial designer:  and it does this  by well , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages  within the remote  which will then be sent to the  the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do .  and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and  the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it .  what we need  technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source ,  some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . industrial designer: which feeds into the circuit chip  which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to  a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons .  also send signals to the  infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ? Sends signals to the the television . user interface: industrial designer: And so my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big  energy source that won't die out ,  perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to  be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you .  a wide range  sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed .  also definitely a user-friendly interface  and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . project manager:  I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of  remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones .  given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's  , you know never needs replacing . industrial designer: project manager:  perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control ,   you know , one some sort of typical usage . By which time  when all's said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale . project manager:   p perhaps we should , know , reduce the  , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and  industrial designer: Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? project manager: Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one . user interface: project manager:  it's , you know , it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well , it's actually a marketing gimmick .  so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is   unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it marketing: It could have like  know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . industrial designer:  yeah user interface: I would think that people might forget project manager: I I th I think user interface:  people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , marketing: industrial designer: project manager:   I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge industrial designer:  . project manager: and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . Yeah , when it turns itself off , that's when I plug it in , project manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah , so   industrial designer: yeah . user interface: project manager: what so wh what what do we think about the  the the permanent  battery ? industrial designer: Yeah , think that's a good idea . project manager: Is the  you know , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex  external simplicity here . project manager:  you know , cut cost within the manufacturing and  you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective .  I can't think of anything off the s top of my head , industrial designer: They usually have the little light  source , project manager: but there are certainly things that you buy . industrial designer: I dunno what the heck they're called , user interface: Yeah , they have that little solar industrial designer: the but project manager: Som well some do , industrial designer: yeah , the little cells that project manager:  th th but there are battery ones industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , project manager:   industrial designer: so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it . project manager: I would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life . industrial designer: Oh , it depend if it's  depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking , user interface: Yeah , some people are project manager: If , but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then  then  then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market industrial designer: yeah . marketing: W project manager: n marketing: like like this  this  market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight user interface: Per hour ? project manager: Right . project manager: Oh , I must admit I hadn't  I'd I'd missed that . user interface: marketing: But then again , if you think it of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like project manager: Yeah . project manager: Well that's right , and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , industrial designer:  . project manager: sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , I don't know I don't actually know . user interface: Though I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different project manager: industrial designer: project manager: Right , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared . Possibly no buttons at all  , but if you can incorporate  channel change and volume buttons  in into the design , then then that's fine .  in the  the the role of the of the  the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an a   a serious constraint .  I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition  and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off .  it needs to incorporate the corporate logo ,  the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce  interchangeable  covers . So are we doing just the television or are we doing so not D_V_D_ players , project manager: No . project manager: I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , industrial designer:  . marketing: Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ? project manager: Oh yeah well th that's one I s that's one I sent you , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: project manager: Okay , so  we can all give some thought to that  for for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed <doc-sep> I did took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment .  I know each of you have a presentation and  in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes ,  each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some  decision on what functions it will have .  and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch ,  and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . I opened the meeting , the product was developed  and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it .  and it had some implications ,  the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 'Kay . industrial designer:  I think so , project manager: Did I miss something ? industrial designer: we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present , but yes , we did , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: and we did a little bit of  team building of  of making the pictures , marketing: Okay , I accept the minutes . One of the the biggest issues I found about  from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these  remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible  useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So  my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools .  some of the research  in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and  that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the  recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And  in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the  will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool .  fifty percent I think of all these  numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of  television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . industrial designer: Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've marketing:  it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . project manager: Now in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be industrial designer: project manager: and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_  with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . Well I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction  brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't  advertise for the I go everywhere line . marketing: Now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and  luck lucky for us have the  cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this  if and you know , the the designers , project manager:  . marketing: but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five project manager: Is that a large enough target market to target it ? marketing: Well , I I I think especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target .  s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and  with the technologies improving , if we can get these  project manager: In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? marketing: Yeah . But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an project manager:  . industrial designer:  marketing: I don't know if speech recognition should be  should be included , project manager:  . marketing: but I think it's an interesting I think that maybe shows more about  being open to technology . user interface:  it definitely needs  a lot more research marketing: Shall I go back ? user interface: on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , marketing: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty ,  is that a lot or a little ? marketing: Exactly .  I I I  did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because  there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but  some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something  perhaps you all have seen  the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a  a small tray . marketing: You know , project manager: marketing: it's I a and I think , you know industrial designer: He must be w one of a s small population . But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and  they'll be project manager: But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , marketing:  . I yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the   leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . marketing: I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is  up to the designers . industrial designer: And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there . user interface: Can I not just  do each one in order ? industrial designer: I you can if you like , it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p project manager: There we are . user interface: That ? industrial designer: Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep .  well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as  your personal preferences,yeah . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions  pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss . user interface:  and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control project manager:  .  but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen .  not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . user interface: So it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than  than actual buttons project manager: Okay . user interface: o I was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and  a menu that you can access . user interface: But we could go back to the pictures of the  , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , marketing: Or if user interface: but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . marketing: Maybe afterwards we could do a  whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis . project manager: I think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , marketing: user interface: Definitely less cluttered and  but still it's project manager: It's there user interface: Sorry project manager: but it's user interface: I was just I'll just  resume something else I was gonna say . user interface: I I I really think we need to  not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . Okay  , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .  basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are  an energy source , the user interface and which will  in incorporate  an integrated circuit that actually composes the message  based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message ,  and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . I would have have hoped to  do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of  my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . But those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ?  what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . project manager: The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or  what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ?  is there any  because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever .  does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? industrial designer: Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . industrial designer:  that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . industrial designer: you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit . marketing: Do we have  ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? user interface: Isn't that your job ? marketing: Because then project manager: Oh . industrial designer: I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , marketing: I I don't believe I know ,  . industrial designer: but marketing: Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . user interface: It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is pretty much the same as these existing models , marketing: user interface: just maybe a little bit more inspired , marketing: Inspired ? user interface: but basically just the same . user interface: Although what what  suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . Could it be possible to have  , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . user interface: You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , marketing: Well user interface: which are marketing: that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place . marketing: Yeah , but it also has a place , user interface: And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . user interface: But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . industrial designer: Well I  think that's a very interesting idea , but  I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . industrial designer: Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , marketing: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Well it is just so annoying how marketing: Depen project manager: It would have to sor store up the energy marketing:  . user interface: No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably  it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , marketing: - user interface: but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer marketing: user interface: and industrial designer: So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? user interface: you know f marketing: Definitely , project manager:  . marketing: 'cause I'm thinking in terms of   the loss and breakage of  remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a  a home , a  a nest , a place to live , user interface:  . marketing: So if you can dock it ,  you know , you could s argue that this is project manager: And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . project manager: Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end . marketing: Well I I brought up some exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: You know , industrial designer: I was wondering that , marketing: these are the industrial designer: because I ag I agree that there there're people with  how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new , project manager: I I s usually put more money than brains . industrial designer: but Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying  , you know , personal music devices and all that , marketing: Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . industrial designer: are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , marketing: Yeah . marketing: It might be good to know   who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a   s region where people have more than one television in a home ? industrial designer:  . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ?  we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . project manager: Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . project manager: What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? marketing: Yeah , and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers . user interface: We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , project manager: Probably not . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful . marketing: Do we need  let me project manager: Is that agreeable to everyone ? marketing: Br actually ,  industrial designer: industrial designer: Do you want the gizmo ? marketing: yeah , which might project manager: Throw some light on that . project manager:  actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing . marketing: Okay , I I my only comment is I think maybe  we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . Again , you know , project manager: Is that okay with you ? marketing: thinking of menus or user interface: Sorry , project manager: Would that industrial designer: H how does that work ? user interface: I was miles away . industrial designer: How so so how does that work , user interface: I was re I was reading the chart to be honest . industrial designer: how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? marketing: if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe  when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter  project manager: Then you'd have to have an off te off key . marketing: so you press power after you've  well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , industrial designer: Okay , yep , marketing: and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . industrial designer: It's not getting a bit complicated ? Could granny do this , marketing: Well industrial designer: or are we just not aiming at granny ? marketing: Or y yeah . user interface: Who's got an iPod then ? industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , project manager:  . Anyway ,  that was the only comment about  some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important . user interface: Yeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , marketing: Exactly . user interface: like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . user interface: I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , marketing: Yeah . project manager: I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . project manager: As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . project manager:  so are we agreed then of those things ? And let's go back to agenda marketing: D project manager: and hook me up . industrial designer: How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ? project manager:  you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to five minutes to finish , industrial designer: Ah okay , it toggles through , project manager: thank you a lot for telling me .  will be completed q questionnaire ,  then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research  and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together .  your individual assignments are for  Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching .  and you'd mentioned I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , project manager: Okay . marketing: because it they were it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself project manager:  the teletext is outdated , industrial designer: So we're still in meeting , aren't we ? project manager: the internet is important , marketing: Yeah , I think I've project manager: it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan  marketing: Okay . Sorry , what what actually are these is that the yellow and black ? project manager: It doesn't tell me "

        "Article": "phd e: What am I ? professor f: Little low ? phd e: Channel four ? professor f: Channel five . phd g: The gai the gain 's up at it what it usually is , professor f: Is it ? phd g: but if you think it 's Yeah . phd d: I think phd g: She can just walk in , I guess , or phd d: Yeah . I was gonna ask Adam to , say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff because it occurred to me that this is late May and the DARPA meeting is in mid July .  , but I don't remember w what we I know that we were gonna do something with the transcriber interface is one thing , but I thought there was a second thing . Anybody remember ? phd g: Well , we were gonna do a mock - up , like , question answering or something , I thought , that was totally separate from the interface . Do you remember ? Remember , like , asking questions and retrieving , but in a pre - stored fashion . phd g: That was the thing we talked about , I think , before the transcriber professor f: Yeah . So anyway , you have to sort out that out and get somebody going on it cuz we 're got a got a month left basically . phd g: I was writing the digits and then I realized I could xerox them , professor f: Oh , oh . professor f: So , the choice is , which which do we want more , the the the comparison , of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that ? phd g: It 's just cuz I didn't have any more digit sheets .  , we could use them for normalizing or something , but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison . phd e: But anyway , they won't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some sometimes , you know , saying O , and so , it 's not i not identical .  ju what what might those be ? phd d: IBM stuff and , just getting  , meeting information organized . phd c: Are you implying that it 's currently disorganized ? phd d: In my mind . professor f: Is there stuff that 's happened about , the SRI recognizer et cetera , tho those things that were happening before with ? phd c: Well . professor f: Y y you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front - ends and then with Is is that still sort of where it was , the other day ? phd c: We 're improving . phd d: Now the the You saw the note that the PLP now is getting basically the same as the MFCC .  , it seems It looks l I haven't The It 's The experiment is still not complete , but , it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully , actually , w using the warp factors that we computed for the SRI system and just applying them to the ICSI front - end . phd c: Just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems .  phd c: But one issue actually that just came up in discussion with Liz and and Don was , as far as meeting recognition is concerned , we would really like to , move , to , doing the recognition on automatic segmentations . phd c: Because in all our previous experiments , we had the  , you know , we were essentially cheating by having the , you know , the h the hand - segmentations as the basis of the recognition . phd c: And so now with Thilo 's segmenter working so well , I think we should consider doing a phd e: Mmm . phd g: And even The good thing is that since you , have high recall , even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of , transients and things that come from the microphones , phd c: Right . phd g: but I know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform , we do very poorly because we 're we 're getting insertions in places what that you may well be cutting out . phd c: We should we should consider doing some extra things , like , you know , retraining or adapting the the models for background noise to the to this environment , for instance . phd g: And , yeah , using Thilo 's , you know , posteriors or some kind of or phd c: So . So , talked with Brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each utterance that we had generated before . And so he talked it over with the transcriber and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu a number , a digit , and then a beep , at the beginning of each one professor f: Yeah . And , so Adam wrote a little script to generate those style , beeps phd c: Where 'd you get the digits from ? phd d: and so we 're I came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten . phd c: And do you splice them into the waveform ? Or ? phd d: Yeah . He then he d I recorded Actually , I recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked . phd d: He liked the fastest one , so he just cut those out and spliced them in between , two beeps . phd d: Does it ? phd e: It will be funny when you 're really reading digits , and then there are the chunks with with your digits in ? phd d: Yeah . postdoc a: Now actually , phd d: That 'll throw them , postdoc a: we 're Are we handling ? phd d: huh ? professor f: maybe we should have you record A , B , C for those or something . And she said it wasn't gonna the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem cuz they can actually make a template , that has beep , number , beep . phd d: So , we We 're gonna send them one more sample meeting , and Thilo has run his segmentation . And when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , too many beeps in the last transcription . Do w do what Do you have any idea of the turn - around on on those steps you just said ? phd g: Great . professor f: e e u u The reason I 'm asking is because , Jane and I have just been talking , and she 's just been doing . professor f: And so we don't sort of really know exactly what they 'll be doing , how long they 'll be doing it , and so forth , because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working . professor f: And , so it 'd be It 'd be good to sort of get that resolved , soon as we could , phd d: Yeah . I Yeah , I I hope @ @ we can get a better estimate from this one that we send them .   in particular I would I would really hope that when we do this DARPA meeting in July that we sort of have we 're we 're into production mode , somehow phd d:   professor f: You know , that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates . Maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing , maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions . So , we  , the transcribers have continued to work past what I 'm calling \" set one \" , which was the s the set that I 've been ,  OK , talking about up to this point , but , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set . I 'm thinking of hiring another one , which will because we 've had a lot of attrition . And that will bring our total to professor f: They die off after they do this for a while .  , you know , one of them really w wasn't planning phd c: Oh , that was an unfor unforeseen side effect of postdoc a: Eh , one of them , had never planned to work past January .  , it 's th all these various things , cuz we , you know , we presented it as possibly a month project back in January and and and and  , so it makes sense .  , through attrition we we 've we 're down to to two , but they 're really solid . We had a good core phd g: Well , they won't hear this since they 're going .  , I d it 's just a matter of we w we 're we 've got , professor f: No backs . postdoc a: two of the ones who who , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a a lot of hours , which is wonderful , and excellent work . And so , then , in addition , I hired two more today and I 'm planning to h hire a third one with this within this coming week , but but the plan is just as , Morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the on the leaner side , you know , rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now , professor f:   postdoc a: because if the IBM thing comes through really quickly , then , we wouldn't wanna have to , you know , lay people off and stuff . And this way it 'll  , I got really a lot of response for for my notice and I think I could hire additional people if I wish to . An - and the other thing is , in the unlikely event and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because , you know , there 's , you know , all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're and they 're faster the the pipeline is faster than  , than the generation , eh , i in in the day e event that that day actually dawns , I I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do . professor f: So I I think that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later . But but ,  for all sorts of reasons but if we hire f you know , f we have five on staff five or six on staff at any given time , then it 's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way . phd g: It 'd be great , too , if , we can we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand to experiment with ,  you know , to have a ground truth for this segmentation work , which I guess you have some already that was really helpful , and we could probably use more . That was a thing I I planned working on , is , to use the the transcriptions which are done by now , and to to use them as ,  phd g: Oh . To to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them , and Yeah , but that that 's a thing w was w what I 'm just looking into . postdoc a: The the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful . Now there was , I g guess So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation f for just very few days you were away . postdoc a: so I so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and , they ,  you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available . postdoc a: And and and she was And so , I asked her  , They 're very perceptive . I haven't done it yet , but I wanna do that and she 's out of town , for a couple of weeks , but I wanna do that when she returns .  , cuz she was saying , you know , in a in a span of very short period we asked It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these these these things , and she was saying the short utterances , the ,  phd g:  . But but actually i it 's so correct for so much of the time , that it 's an enormous time saver phd e: Yeah . phd g: Is there actually a record of where they change ?  , you can compare , do a diff on the just so that we knew postdoc a: You could do it . It 's it 's complicated in that  , hhh , i hhh , i phd e: Yeah . Actually , when when they create new yeah , new segments or something , it will be , not that easy but  . phd g: just so that if we run it we know whether we 're which ones were cheating phd e: Yeah . phd g: and postdoc a: There is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version . Wha - what you 'd really like is that they started with pre - segmented and were pre - segmented all the way through . postdoc a: And ,  @ @ I ,  the it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones . As long as we have a record , I guess , of the original automatic one , we can always find out how well we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries . phd g: Also if you need someone to record this meeting , I 'm happy to for the transcribers I could do it , or Chuck or Adam . So , Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting professor f: Did you record it ? phd d: No . And then , Jane also s prepared a  , started getting all of the the meetings organized , so she prepared a a spreadsheet , which I spent the last couple of days adding to . So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have been putting it into , a spreadsheet with start time , the date , the old meeting name , the new meeting name , the number of speakers , the duration of the meeting , comments , you know , what its transcription status is , all that kind of stuff . And so , the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page so we can keep people updated about what 's going on . phd d: I 've gotta get some more information from Jane cuz I have some some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in , but so far , as of Monday , the fourteenth , we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected .  , and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far , but I 've got a bunch of  , that 's what I have to talk to Jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth . But , this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the the web site and people can be informed of the status of various different ones . And it 'll also list , like under the status , if it 's at IBM or if it 's at ICSI , or if it 's completed or which ones we 're excluding and and there 's a place for comments , so we can , say why we 're excluding things and so forth . professor f: Now would the ones that , are already transcribed we h we have enough there that c you know , we 've already done some studies and so forth and  , shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of of having the , participants approve it , for approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ? postdoc a: interesting idea . In principle , I I would say yes , although I still am doing some the final - pass editing , trying to convert it over to the master file as the being the channelized version and it 's Yeah , it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes and I have to stop . Cleaning up the things like the , places where the transcriber was uncertain , and and doing spot - checking here and there . So , I guess it would make sense to wait until th that 's done , but but professor f: Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of as as I did with the ,  the the pipeline . professor f: we are gonna have this DARPA meeting in the middle of July , postdoc a: Yes . professor f: and I think it w it 'd be given that we 've been we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . So we can s we we wanna be able to say \" here is a subset that is available right now \" postdoc a:   phd c: And they don't have to approve , you know , th an edited version , they can just give their approval to whatever version postdoc a: Well , maybe professor f: Well , in principle , yes . But , i if if if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we phd c: Bu Yeah . Presumably if if s errors are found , they will be fixed , but they won't change the the content of the meetings . phd g: Well , i if Jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ? postdoc a: The other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ could 've been transcribed in the other way . phd g: Thing postdoc a: And no and they wouldn't have been slanderous if it had been this other word . You know ? professor f: I it you know , there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . Right ? And you don't you there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody \" do you approve this , you know this document now ? \" So So I think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign I I haven't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says \" OK , from now on you know , now that I 've read this , you can use do anything you want with these data . professor f: And ,  But , i I think we wanna So , assuming that it 's in that kind of wording , which I don't remember , I think i we just wanna have enough confidence ourselves that it 's so close to the final form it 's gonna be in , a year from now that they 're postdoc a:   It 's just , a question of , if if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous , then it seems like it 's it 's i it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re - listening to the meeting . postdoc a: Because it becomes , eh , in a way a a f  , a legal document i if they 've agreed to that . I forget how we ended up on this , but I remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything and Adam was taking the position of of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio . And I don't remember who won , Adam or me , but postdoc a: Well , if it 's only the transcript , though  , th this this is my point , that that professor f: the  , that that 's why I 'm bringing this up again , because I can't remember how we ended up . postdoc a: then it becomes professor f: That it was the transcrip He wanted to do a web interface that would make it postdoc a: Well , if it 's just the audio Well . phd g: with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . Like , I don't wanna know , but some people might be really interested and then y In other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that . professor f: You decided you were whispering Satanic incantations under your breath when you were phd g: Well , I don't know what happened to the small heads thing , but I j  , I 'm just saying that , like , you know , you can sort of say that any things that are deemed professor f: They disappeared from view .  , I agree that at some point people probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes and then they could be asked for their consent , I guess , if if those change . Cuz assumi assuming we we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign anyway . phd c: Tha That 's How about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts ? phd g: Oh , my God . grad b: That 's phd c: We just have to give them a chance to listen to it , and if they don't , that 's their problem . phd g: You you d That 's like postdoc a: Unfortunately , in in the sign thing that they signed , it says \" transcripts \" . postdoc a: \" You 'll be you 'll be provided the transcripts when they 're available . phd g: that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings . professor f: W anyway , haven't we we 've gone down this path a number of times . I know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere , so let let me just suggest that  , off - line that , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's July . So so that in July we can tell people \" yes , we have this and you can use it \" . phd g: it 's I guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount We have eight meetings there because we couldn't use the non - native all non - native meetings and it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them .  , so we 're starting to see some patterns and we 're hoping that maybe with , I don't know , double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results . But we did find that some of the features that , I gue Jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the distance of , boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local , range pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers , which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words . Right ? phd g: spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words , grad b: Right . phd c: No phd g: Not exactly , but i grad b: But ra somewhat ? professor f: On the average . Well , we don't know and actually that 's one of the things we 're interested in doing , is a sort of professor f:  - huh . phd c: Have you tried using just time , as opposed to number of words ? phd g: So . grad b: I think ti  Just p time position , like when the word starts ? phd c: Yeah . grad b: I don't know if that was in the phd c: Well , no ,  t time time position relative to the beginning of the spurt . phd g: we didn't try it , but it 's s grad b: Like , there 's a lot of different features you could just pull out . professor f: How about time position normalized by speak phd g: And it depends on speaking rate professor f: Yeah . phd g: But we one of the interesting things was I guess you reported on some te punctuation type grad b: Yeah . phd g: finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries , and then I had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt , so where you know , if I 'm talking now and someone and and Andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gonna choose a certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based . And there the prosodic features actually showed up and a neat thing even though the word features were available . And a neat thing there too is I tried some putting the speaker So , I gave everybody a short version of their name . So that means that overall , it wasn't just modeling Morgan , or it wasn't just modeling a single person , professor f:   phd g: but was sort of trying to , get a general idea the model the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers , even though there are huge speaker effects . The but the main limitation now is I because we 're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words , we need more more data and more data per speaker . It 'd also be interesting to look at the EDU meetings because we did include meeting type as a feature , so whether you were in a r Meeting Recorder meeting or a Robustness meeting did matter to interrupts because there are just fewer interrupts in the Robustness meetings . phd g: And so the classifier learns more about Morgan than it does about sort of the average person , professor f:   phd g: So it 's And I think Don ,  Well , we have a long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer , where we can And he 'll be able to report on more things in the future . But it was great that we could at least go from the you know , Jane 's transcripts and the , recognizer output and get it to this point . And I think it 's something Mari can probably use in her preliminary report like , \" yeah , we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers and we 're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features , both word and pro prosodic , work . \" The other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in Switchboard . And I think that really is from the close - talking mikes , cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than than the Switchboard telephone bandwidth . Well , first of all , the pitch tracks are m have less , halvings and doublings than than Switchboard and there 's a lot less dropout , so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information , professor f:    phd g: in other words the pitch tracker just didn't get a high enough probability of voicing for words for for , you know , five word professor f:  . So the missing We had a big missing data problem in Switchboard and , so the features weren't as reliable cuz they were often just not available . phd d: Could it have to do with the the lower frequency cut - off on the Switchboard ? phd g: So that 's actually good .  , the tele we had telephone bandwidth for Switchboard and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that I think may also affect it . phd g: Anyway , Don 's been doing a great job and we hope to continue with , Andreas 's help and also some of Thilo 's help on this , professor f: Great . phd e: Y phd g: to to try to get a non - cheating version of how all this would work . professor f: Has has ,  ? We just I think , just talked about this the other day , but h has has anybody had a chance to try changing , insertion penalty sort of things with the with the , using the tandem system input for the ? phd c: Oh , yeah . phd c: There were a little the relative number of I think there were a higher number of deletions , actually . phd c: So , you ,  So , actually it it preferred to have a positive er , negative insertion penalty , phd g: Deletions ? phd c: which means that ,  professor f:  - huh . phd c: But , you know , it didn't change th the by adjusting that the ,  professor f: OK . But , you know , given that that word error rate is so high , that 's not a professor f: OK . phd c: But , we s just ,  you know , Chuck and I talked and the @ @ next thing to do is probably to tune the  , the size of the Gaussian system , @ @ to to this to this feature vector , which we haven't done at all . phd c: And , for instance , Dan @ @ Dan just sent me a message saying that CMU used , something like ten Gaussians per cluster You know , each each mixture has ten Gaussians phd d:   We 're using sixty - four , phd c: and and we 're using sixty - four , phd d: right ? phd c: so that 's obviously a big difference phd d: Yeah . phd c: and it might be way off and give very poorly trained , you know , Gaussians that way , professor f:  . So so , we have The turn - around time on the training when we train only the a male system with , you know , our small training set , is less than twenty - four hours , so we can run lots of  , basically just brute force , try a whole bunch of different  , settings . professor f: huh ? phd c: But the PLP features work  , you know , continue to improve the , professor f: OK . phd c:  As I said before , the  using Dan 's , vocal tract normalization option works very well . So , @ @ I ran one experiment where we 're just did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data , professor f:   phd c: so I didn't bother to retrain the models at all , and it improved by one percent , which is about what we get with  , with , you know , just @ @ actually doing both training and test normalization , with , the , with the standard system . So , in a few hours we 'll have the numbers for the for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization and So , that might even improve it further . phd c: So , it looks like the P L - fea P features do very well now with after having figured out all these little tricks to to get it to work . So you mean you improve one percent over a system that doesn't have any V T L in it already ? phd c: Exactly . And and what that suggests also is of course that the current Switchboard MLP isn't trained on very good features . phd c: because it was trained on whatever , you know , was used , last time you did Hub - five stuff , which didn't have any of the professor f: Right . professor f: Right ?  , y the phd c: Well , but if you add them all up you have , almost five percent difference now . phd c: actually , and it 's , What 's actually qu interesting is that with  , well , you m prob maybe another half percent if you do the VTL in training , and then interestingly , if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the , the N best lists , and optimizing the weights ,  than phd d: Than you do with the standard ? phd c: Yeah . But the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting VTLN in or something is it was a couple percent . professor f: Right ? It was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . One of them was , the change to ,  because it did it all at once , to  , from bark scale to mel scale , phd c:   professor f: which I really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @ they 're essentially the same scale but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . professor f: So that 's why I wanted to look I still haven't looked at it yet . professor f: and it it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub one kilohertz band phd c:   professor f: it could be there 's something more fundamental but it you know , I I don't know it yet . And the other and the other that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was what was the other thing ? phd d: Well , that was combined with the triangular . professor f: We d weren't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing . So that was that was ,  that one I can claim credit for , i in terms of screwing it up in the first place . So that someone e until someone else fixed it , which is that , I never put when I u We had some problems before with offsets . professor f: So we we had ,  ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data in those data and and and nobody happened to mention it to us , phd c:  . professor f: and we were getting these , like , really terrible results , like two , three times the error everybody else was getting . And then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned \"  , well , I guess , you know , of course you 're taking care of the offsets . professor f: And at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen and then when we just put it on the screen and wroop ! phd c:   So , in PLP phd g: There was a like a hum or some or when they recorded it ? professor f: No . It 's just , it it 's it 's not at all uncommon for for recorded electronics to have different , DC offsets . It 's you know , you could have ten , twenty , maybe thirty millivolts , whatever , and it 's consistently in there . The thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency , so that it 's irrelevant . We had we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a a , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency , phd g:  . So at that point I reali \" oh sh we better have a have a high - pass filter \" just , you know just take care of the problem . So I put in a high - pass filter at , I think ninety ninety hertz or so  , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate . And so well , so , you know , the code doesn't know anything about that and so this is all at eight kilohertz and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety . professor f: So , I don't know if Dan fixed it or or , what he phd c: Well , he made it a parameter . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it and then and then it 's taking care of sampling rate , which is great . phd d: What what is the parameter ? professor f: He had a phd d: Is it , just the f lower cut - off that you want ? phd c: It 's called , H - HPF . phd c: u And but HPF , you know , when you put a number after it , uses that as the hertz value of the cut - off . professor f: frankly , we never did that with the RASTA filter either , phd c:   professor f: so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing , which is another old old bug of mine . So that that was the problem there was th we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz phd c:   Well , but ,  Well , again , after completing the current experiments , we 'll we can add up all the  differences professor f: Oh , yeah . phd c: and and an professor f: But but , I guess my my point was that that , the hybrid system thing that we did was , primitive in many ways . professor f: And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have a a a competitive system . professor f: unless you call well , if you call VTL the front - en front - end , that 's , a little more . phd d: One experiment we should we 'll probably need to do though when  , at some point , is , since we 're using that same the net that was trained on PLP without all these things in it , for the tandem system , we may wanna go back and retrain , professor f: Right ? But . phd c: eh At this point I 'm as  , you know e I 'm wondering is it Can we expect , a tandem system to do better than a properly trained you know , a Gaussian system trained directly on the features with , you know , the right ch choice of parameters ? professor f: Well , that 's what we 're seeing in other areas . Right ? So , it 's so ,  phd d: So , we But but we may not . professor f: the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative . Now the thing is , in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much and and part of what I view as the real power of it is that it gives you a transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do , not just th the standard front - end , but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth , phd c:   professor f: If it 's , you know , like way way worse then , you know phd c: Right . phd d: So , Morgan , an another thing that Andreas and I were talking about was , so @ @ in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six , outputs and that 's , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either MFCC or PLP . phd d: But one thing we could do is professor f: Let let me let me just ask you something . When you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity outputs phd d: Yeah . And so so then you u Do you use all fifty - six of the KLT phd d: That 's what we did . professor f: or ? phd d: Right ? So one thing we were wondering is , if we did principal components and , say , took out just thirteen , and then did deltas and double - deltas on that professor f: OK . professor f:  these were all different databases and different you know , in HTK and all that , phd d: Yeah . But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse . professor f: But , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , components . phd d: Cuz in a sense , the net 's already got quite a bit of context in those features , professor f: Yeah . phd d: so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more . phd c: But there the main point is that , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now and  , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features  , either generating them or feeding them to this to the SRI system , phd d:   phd c: but it 's professor f: There might be , cuz that 's a pretty big difference . phd c: I 'm actually f quite sure that the feeding the features into the system and training it up , professor f: What if ? phd c: that that I think that 's this that 's essentially the same as we use with the ce with the P L P fe features . phd c: There we could the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the K L T transform ? phd d:   professor f: These nets are trained with particular normalization and when that gets screwed up it it can really hurt it . phd d: I 'm doing what Eric E Eric coached me through then that part of it , so I 'm pretty confident in that . phd d: the only slight difference is that I use normalization values that , Andreas calculated from the original PLP , phd c: Right . So , I u I do Oh , we actually don't do that normalization for the PLP , do we ? For the st just the straight PLP features ? phd c: No . Well , you might e e phd c: So , there 's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered , phd d: So that 's that 's another Yeah . I I would actually double check with Stephane at this point , phd c: but professor f: cuz he 's probably the one here  , he and Dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem phd d:   professor f: thing and there may there may be some little bit here and there that is not not being handled right .  , you can't just , like , print the the values out in ASCII and , you know , look at them , see if they 're professor f: Not unless you had a lot of time phd g: Well professor f: and phd g: eh , and also they 're not  , as I understand it , you you don't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error . phd g: these are just discriminative , but they 're not , optimized for the final phd c: They 're optimized for phone discrimination , not for phd g: Right . So it there 's always this question of whether you might do better with those features if there was a way to train it for the word error metric that you 're actually that you 're actually professor f: That 's right . It 's indirect , so you don't know professor f: So wha w what an and you may not be in this case , come to think of it , because , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere . So in fact you the the net is trained on , a , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system . And so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant . You can prove that it 's it 's a ,  If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that , getting the best path , is almost equivalent to getting the best , total probability , then you actually do improve that by ,  by training up on local local ,  local frames . But , we aren't actually doing that here , because we did we did that for a hybrid system , and now we 're plugging it into another system and so it isn't i i i it wouldn't quite apply here . phd c: Do y phd d: So another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features , do SRI forced alignments using those features , and then re - do the net with those . Another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be . So , you 're using a l a long a larger phone set than what phd d: Mmm . professor f: The other thing , just to mention that Stephane this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one , and might particularly apply here , given all these things we 're mentioning . Even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones .  , when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that , the discrimination that you 're learning is is is not a good one . professor f: So , his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the , Gaussian mixture system , a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features . No , but we we when when we when I first started corresponding with Dan about how to go about this , I think that was one of the things that we definitely went there .  , I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it , phd c: Yeah . So that 's that that 's our current best best system in the , in the Aurora thing . phd c: And do you do a KLT transform on the con on the combined feature vector ? professor f: Yeah . phd c: Do you d you do a KLT transform on the combined feature vector ? professor f: Yeah . professor f: Well , actually , I ,  you should check with him , because he tried several different combinations . phd c: Because you end up with this huge feature vector , so that might be a problem , a unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction . So he did one where he put o put e the whole thing into one KLT , and another one , since the the PLP things are already orthogonalized , he left them alone and and just did a KLT on the on the on the net outputs phd c:   phd d: Did he did he try to ? So he always ended up with a feature vector that was twice as long as either one of the ? professor f: No . phd g: We need to close up cuz I need to save the data and , get a call . phd g: or , do them together ? professor f: I I g I think , given that we 're in a hurry for snacks , maybe we should do them together . professor f: Well , it 's it 's it 's not You know , it 's not gonna work out phd g: Adam 's not here , so he 's not here to tell me no . professor f: but we could we could just , see if we find a rhythm , you know , what phd g: Sure . professor f: O 's or zeroes , we wanna agree on that ? phd g: Maybe just whatever people would naturally do ? I don't know . professor f: Why don't we do zer i Anyone have a problem with saying zero ? Is zero OK ? phd g: No <doc-sep>grad g: So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working . postdoc b: And it looks like you 've found a way of  mapping the location to the without having people have to give their names each time ? phd a: Sounds like an initialization thing . postdoc b:  it 's like you have the So you know that grad g: No . postdoc b: are you going to write down that I sat here ? grad g: I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down . u And I should say that  , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly . professor e: So  , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project . grad g: And I 'm surprised I sort of I 'm surprised I forgot that , professor e: Yeah , I I 'd I think it 's some grad g: but  I think that would be a good thing to add . professor e: Yeah , well , that 's  , so I I do have a a an agenda suggestion .  , we I think the things that we talk about in this meeting  tend to be a mixture of  procedural  mundane things and  research points and  I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So  I 'm suggesting we turn it around and and  sort of we have anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later ,  hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the the research - y kind of things .  , so  the one th one thing I know that we have on that is  we had talked a a couple weeks before   about the  the stuff you were doing with with    l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was  points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean  interruptions with something else phd d: Yeah . phd d: To professor e: So at any rate you were you 've you 've done some work on that phd d: right . professor e: and  then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other  research  areas that  we 're thinking about doing .  , I think especially since you you haven't been in in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data ,  and one of the things I know that also came up  is some discussions that that  that  Jane had with Lokendra  about some some some   work about I I I d I I don't want to try to say cuz I I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some some potential collaboration there about about the about the working with these data . Well , I don't know if we if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple a couple people primarily  but   , wh why don't Actually I think that that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you you start with that . postdoc b: so , he was interested in the question of you know , relating to his to the research he presented recently ,  of inference structures , and  , the need to build in , this this sort of  mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how  , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how  , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the the the causal aspects of the  floor and and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that  it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , and  , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and  , one of them was something like  , during the course of the transcript , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and  , the question was raised \" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? \" And and Dan Ellis said , \" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now we really don't need to \" . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \" ? You know . So it 's the it 's i What you what you int what you draw you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording , grad g: metaphorically . postdoc b: that  , i that i we have enough space , and he continues , like \" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling \" . So you have to sort of get the idea that  , \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that  that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far . grad g: So , do you think his interest is in using this as a data source , or training material , or what ? professor e: Well , I I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , so  we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours grad g:   professor e: and   I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data ,  and  such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much  effort into that he should  , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're already have and see , is there anything to this at all ? grad g:   professor e: Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it . Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say \" well , this is just the wrong task for for him to pursue his \" grad g: Wrong , yeah . professor e: And and  I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that that you looked at that that it 's plausible at least .  , he was he he you know We met and he was gonna go and  you know , y look through them more systematically professor e: Yeah . postdoc b: So it 's , you know , not a matter of a professor e: Yeah . professor e: So anyway , that 's that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might might might come out from some of this .  , he 's talking about just using text postdoc b: That 's his major I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours phd c: pretty much , or ? postdoc b: and that wasn't as directly relevant to what he 's doing . postdoc b: inferences that you draw i from professor e: he certainly could use text , but we were in fact looking to see if there is there is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in in in this stuff . grad g: And I imagine that transcripts of speech  text that is speech probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing . postdoc b: Yeah , I don't think I would make that leap , because i in narratives , you know  , if you spell out everything in a narrative , it can be really tedious , grad g:   grad g: Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel and And postdoc b: Oh . And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face .  , so , if I just read that Dan was saying \" we 're ahead of the game \" in that in that context , postdoc b: Well Yeah . grad g: I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else . postdoc b: I you know , I I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them . postdoc b: This this one really does  m make you leap from So he said , you know , \" we 're ahead of the game , w we have built - in downsampling \" . postdoc b: And the inference , i if you had it written down , would be grad g: I guess it would be the same . But there are others that have backchannelling , it 's just he was less interested in those .  , I f f f I 've @ @ d A minute  , several minutes ago , I , like , briefly was was not listening and So who is \" he \" in this context ? phd c: Yeah , there 's a lot of pronoun phd f: OK . So I was just realizing we 've You guys have been talking about \" he \"  for at least  , I don't know , three three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again . Actually to make it worse , Morgan uses \" you \" and \" you \" phd f: So this is this is this is gonna be a big , big problem if you want to later do  , you know , indexing , or speech understanding of any sort . phd f: You just wrote this ? phd c: and he never said Li - He looked grad g: Well , I think he 's doing that intentionally , phd c: Right , so it 's great . grad g: aren't you ? phd c: So this is really great phd f: Right . phd c: because the thing is , because he 's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation , phd d: Yeah . phd c: Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice . postdoc b: Oh , but you 'd have the phd c: Put Morgan always like this postdoc b: You 'd have fainter phd c: and postdoc b: Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here ? professor e: Well , these grad g: Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ? Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking , now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking , I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference . grad g: So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you . professor e: I probably been affect No , I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about and concerns about \" oh gee is somebody going to say something bad ? \" and so on . professor e: And so I so I 'm I 'm tending to stay away from people 's names even though  postdoc b: I am too . phd c: Even though you could pick up later on , just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at . grad g: or or is that just too sensitive ? professor e: No no , it isn't sensitive at all . postdoc b: Well professor e: I was just I was just I was overreacting just because we 've been talking about it . professor e: It 's OK to postdoc b: I I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention .  , it fits into the m area of the mundane , but they did say You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , you know , it says \" no individuals will be identified  , \" in any publication using the data . \" OK , well , individuals being identified , let 's say you have a a snippet that says , \" Joe s  thinks such - and - such about about this field , but I think he 's wrongheaded . \" Now  , we 're we 're gonna be careful not to have the \" wrongheaded \" part in there , but but you know , let 's say we say , you know , \" Joe used to think so - and - so about this area , in his publication he says that but I think he 's changed his mind . Then the issue of of being able to trace Joe , because we know he 's well - known in this field , and all this and and tie it to the speaker , whose name was just mentioned a moment ago , can be sensitive . professor e: b But I postdoc b: So I think it 's really really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there 's a slanderous aspect to it , then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove ? professor e: Yeah , well , there 's that . But I  I think also to some extent it 's just educating the Human Subjects people , in a way , because there 's If  You know , there 's court transcripts , there 's there 's transcripts of radio shows  people say people 's names all the time . It 's just that i  you 're right that there 's more poten If we never say anybody 's name , then there 's no chance of of of slandering anybody , phd c: But , then it won't  , if we if we professor e: but grad g: It 's not a meeting . postdoc b: Well , my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it , you know . phd f: Well , if you ha since you have to  go over the transcripts later anyway , you could make it one of the jobs of the people who do that to mark grad g: Well , we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization . grad g: If we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name . professor e: So it 's postdoc b: So , we need to talk about this later . I sorta knew I was doing it but it was phd f: Well , I still don't know who \" he \" is . phd c: No , you have to say , you still don't know who \" he \" is , with that prosody .  , I I would like to move it into into  what Jose  has been doing postdoc b: Yeah . I I remind that me my first objective eh , in the project is to to study difference parameters to to find a a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded . But eh , tsk , ehhh In that way I I I begin to to study and to analyze the ehn the recorded speech eh the different session to to find and to locate and to mark eh the the different overlapping zone . And eh so eh I was eh I am transcribing the the first session and I I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events , eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I I  the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , eh I don't know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the n speech phd a: Nonspeech sounds ? phd d: Yeah . grad g: Oh , I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail . Eh , I I I do I don't need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic , but I prefer because eh I would like to to study if eh , I I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh , eh acoustic events , to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh  pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature grad g:   phd a: You know I think some of these  that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there 's two there . phd a: if it 's a tapping sound , you wouldn't necessarily or , you know , something like that , it 'd be it might be hard to know that it was two separate events . grad g: Well You weren't talking about just overlaps phd d: Ye grad g: were you ? You were just talking about acoustic events . phd d: I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general , grad g: Someone starts , someone stops Yeah . professor e: How many overlaps were there  in it ? No no , how many of them were the overlaps of speech , though ? phd d: How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session grad g: Oh , God ! phd d: in five eh in forty - five minutes . postdoc b: Does this ? So if you had an overlap involving three people , how many times was that counted ? phd d: Yeah , three people , two people . Eh ,  I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background , be professor e: No no , but I think what she 's asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ? phd d: Oh . This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh are talking together . grad g: Well So let 's postdoc b: For grad g: So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time , and then Liz starts talking also over all of us . phd d: Yeah ? grad g: Is there an event right here ? phd d: Eh no . For me is the overlapping zone , because because you you have s you have more one eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a in in a moment . If professor e: So then , in the region between since there there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking . professor e: Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event , phd d: Yeah . professor e: or are you calling the entire length of it the event ? phd d: I consider the the , nnn the nnn , nnn eh , the entirety eh , eh , all all the time there were the voice has overlapped .  , I 'm not considering eh the the ehm eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ? Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are  , eh speaking , and eh , eh a third person eh join to to that . For me , it 's eh it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event . Wi - but  , without any mark between the zone of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together , and the zone with the three speakers . grad g: Well , but But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two . phd d: I I don't know what eh will will happen with the grad g: Yep . grad g: That 's a lot of overlap , phd d: Yeah ? professor e: So again , that 's that 's three three hundred in forty - five minutes that are that are speakers , just speakers . postdoc b: But a a a th professor e: So that 's about eight per minute . postdoc b: But a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's phd d: Yeah , but Yeah . postdoc b: Well , but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot . phd c: Actually phd d: I I con I consider I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too . grad g: Silence starting or silence ending phd d: Yeah , silent , ground to bec to detect eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech .  silent , I I I I don't I I haven't the eh I I would like to to do a stylistic study professor e: Yeah . phd d: and give you eh with the report eh from eh the the study from the the the session one session . When eh eh I w I I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm the mixed file , to to transcribe , the the events and the words , I I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh collected by headphone . The the the I I I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different , but eh the the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by by that mike  qui compared with the mixed file . And so if when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn the mixed file , it 's possible eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system , it 's possible you eh in the eh i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh to nnn to do the experiments with the the system , professor e:   phd d: its possible to evaluate eh , eh or to consider eh acoustic events that which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the by the mike . The the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription . grad g: So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here phd d: Yeah . grad g: if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gonna show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM . So and I I I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I I in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh to eh to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal . phd d:  the the the signal collected by the eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech professor e:   professor e: Yeah , well , just  , just in that that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that that we we passed on to others a few months ago , there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time and and  , in the close - talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap , and in the distant mike you could . So yeah , it 's clear that if you wanna study if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap , it 's probably better to use a distant mike . professor e: On the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes , phd d: Yeah . phd c: But why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ? professor e: so it 's grad g: If you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , you would hear Jane interrupting me , but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling . And so if you 're interested in phd c: I  if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem , professor e: Some of it 's masking masked . grad g: Although the other issue is that the mixed close - talking mikes  , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that . phd d: I I I think eh I saw the nnn the eh but eh I eh I have eh any results . I I I saw the the speech file collected by eh the fet mike , and eh eh signal eh to eh to noise eh relation is eh low . phd d: And I I found that nnn that eh , ehm , pr probably , grad g: Did Did you phd d: I 'm not sure eh by the moment , but it 's it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , eh for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh in in several eh parts of the files where you you can find eh , eh eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the in the meeting , professor e:   phd d: it 's probably in in that eh in in those files you you can not find you can not process because eh it 's confused with with noise . But eh my idea is to to process only nnn , this eh nnn , this kind of s of eh speech . I 'm not sure it 's a good idea , but eh professor e: No i grad g: Well , it 's more realistic but it 'll it 'll be a lot harder . professor e: Well , it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your if i if if your concern is to get  the overlapping people people 's speech , you will you will get that somewhat better . professor e: Are you making any use  you were you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed . professor e: Now  did you make any use of that ? See I was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed . professor e: Do you phd d: The the transcription by Jane , t eh i eh , I I I want to use to to nnn , eh to put i i it 's a reference for me . But eh the transcription eh for example , I I don't I I 'm not interested in the in the in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in eh follow in the in the in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker , in the in the meeting ,  eh she she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh there is an overlapping zone . But eh there isn't any any mark , time temporal mark , to to c eh to mmm e - heh , to label the beginning and the end of the of the professor e:   Right , so she is phd d: ta I 'm I I I think eh we need this information to professor e: Right . So the twelve you you it took you twelve hours of course this included maybe some some time where you were learning about what what you wanted to do , but but  , it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes , your grad g: Twelve minutes . professor e: I thought you did forty - five minutes of phd d: No , forty - five minutes is the is the session , all the session . phd d: Tw - twelve hours of work to to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part of f professor e: Oh . I I consider all the all the session because eh I I count the nnn the nnn the overlappings marked by by Jane , professor e: Oh , OK . So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes , but you have you have time  ,  marked twelve minute the the the  overlaps in twelve minutes of it . phd f: So , can I ask can I ask whether you found  , you know , how accurate  Jane 's   labels were as far as grad g: Well , not just the overlaps , everything . phd f: you know , did she miss some overlaps ? or did she n ? phd d: But , by by the moment , I I don't compare , my my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I I want to do it . Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the in the marks , I and if I I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I I I can correct and and and to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file . phd c: Well , not only a word level , but actually phd d: Well phd f: I 'm expect I 'm not expecting phd d: No , it 's phd c: you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption , you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or grad g: Right . postdoc b: And and sometimes , you know , it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle , phd d: Yeah . postdoc b: but , yeah , w it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that i disrupt that unit in order to have , you know , a the words in the order in which they were spoken , it would have it would have been hard with the interface that we have . postdoc b: Now , my a Adam 's working on a of course , on a revised overlapping interface , phd d:  - huh . phd d: I I I think It 's it 's a good eh work , postdoc b: but phd d: but eh I think we need eh eh more information . phd f: I expect you to find more overlaps than than Jane grad g: Always need more for postdoc b: Yeah . I I have to go to phd f: because you 're looking at it at a much more detailed level . professor e: I have grad g: But if it takes sixty to one professor e: Well , I but I have a suggestion about that .  , obviously this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things which I 'm sure are gonna be very interesting , but in the interests of making progress ,  might I s how how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ? phd d: Only . professor e: but only mark speaker Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ? phd d: OK . I I I I w I I wanted to professor e: Do y do you think that would speed it up ?  , speed up your your your marking ? phd d: nnn , I don't understand very . professor e: Now , my suggestion was for the other thirty - three phd d: On - only to mark only to mark overlapping zone , but professor e: Yeah , and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ? phd d: Oh , yeah . professor e: Then I think it 's a good idea , because it phd d: Sure , because I I need a lot of time to to put the label or to do that . professor e: There 's there 's  continual noise  from fans and so forth , and there is  more impulsive noise from  taps and so forth phd d: Yeah . We know that all that 's there and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study , but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things . professor e: Whereas th i I would think that  you we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking . Then you can get the Cuz you need If it 's three hundred  i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really phd d: Yeah . professor e: And and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of  even visual sense of of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics . phd c: Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the grad g: Well , that 's That 's what I was gonna bring up . phd c: you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand , professor e: OK , yeah . professor e: So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as  there 's a bunch of things  , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one . professor e: and  , it 's not obvious , you could you could do the dumbest thing and get get it ninety percent of the time . But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the you know , the right detector . And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say \" OK this , i you know , it 's it 's really here \" . phd a: But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ? phd c: What  is get it from the close - talking mikes . phd c: A or ge get a first pass from those , professor e: We t we t w we t we talked about that . phd c: and then go through sort of It 'd be a lot faster probably to phd f: And you can grad g: Yeah , that 's his ,  professor e: We we we talked about that . s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is , phd c: Yeah , I just professor e: the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway , and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful , phd c: Right . You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better , or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurements ,  from the close - talking mike . phd c: Well , that 's what I wonder , because  or how bad it is , professor e: Well phd c: be  , because that would be interesting grad g: I 'm working on a program to do that , and phd c: especially because the bottleneck is the transcription . phd c: so  it seems like one kind of project that 's not perfect , but  , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know , if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech , professor e: Right , we discussed that . phd c: you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ? grad g: And postdoc b: Oh . grad g: I 've I 've written a program to do that , phd c: OK , I 'm sorry I missed the grad g: and it ,  professor e: It 's OK . And , it seems to work , I 've I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something , and I haven't I don't what I 'm working on was working on was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , into Transcriber . I 've worked on it for about half a day , grad h: I have to go . grad g: so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with . professor e: See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working , because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided , phd c: Right . phd c: It professor e: So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when when he he gets his thing going , grad g: But professor e: and phd c: Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of postdoc b:   postdoc b: Was that  there m there was this already a script I believe  that Dan had written , that  handle bleedthrough ,  cuz you have this this close you have contamination from other people who speak loudly . So I I haven't tried that , but that If It it might be something it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little . postdoc b: So , some thought of maybe having Yeah , having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours . professor e: But but that 's a refinement postdoc b: That 's what we were discussing . professor e: and I think we wanna see try the simple thing first , cuz you add this complex thing up  afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first . professor e: But  , having having somebody have some experience , again , with with  with marking it from a human standpoint , we 're  , I don't expect Jose to to do it for  f fifty hours of of speech , but  we if  if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it . professor e: And when when  Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different . phd a: You know , I did I did  something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs , and it works pretty well .  , i almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with a median filter , you look for runs . phd a: And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to to do it . grad g: Yeah , do you have a patent on it ? phd a: It was when I was working for the government . postdoc b: Well , is this something that we could just co - opt , or is it ? phd a: Nah . I think I think it 's phd a: Yeah , he 's it it doesn't take a long time . I just thought if it was tried and true , then and he 's gone through additional levels of of development . Although if you if you have some parameters like what 's a good window size for the median filter phd a: Oh ! I have to remember . phd f: They grad g: I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , sorts of numbers . professor e: I don't know , it if if we want to  So , maybe we should move on to other other things in limited time . postdoc b: Can I ask one question about his statistics ? So so in the tw twelve minutes , if we took three hundred and divided it by four , which is about the length of twelve minutes , i  , I 'd expect like there should be seventy - five overlaps . postdoc b: Did you find  more than seventy - five overlaps in that period , or ? phd d: More than ? postdoc b: More than How many overlaps in your twelve minutes ? phd d: How many ? Eh , not @ @ I Onl - only I I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the professor e: Yeah . phd d: but eh I I don't co eh I don't count eh the the overlap . phd d: I consider I I The the nnn The the three hundred is eh considered only you your transcription . grad g: I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than than sort of the middle . grad g: Because i we 're we 're dealing with the  , in the early meetings , we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , and things like that , phd d: Yeah . professor e: So so I was gonna ask , I guess about any any other things that that that either of you wanted to talk about , especially since Andreas is leaving in five minutes , that that you wanna go with . phd c: Can I just ask about the data , like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data , just cuz I 'm I wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what what can be done first and like how many meetings are we recording professor e: Right so there 's this this There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed . phd c: and professor e: That piece was then  sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point . Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and  put on CD - ROM and sent  to IBM . phd c: How many meetings is that ? Like how many grad g: What 's that ? professor e: That was about ten hours , and there was about phd c: t ten It 's like ten meetings or something ?  - huh . And then then we phd a: Ten meetings that have been sent to IBM ? phd c: And professor e: Yeah . grad g: Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the missing files . phd a: H how many total have we recorded now , altogether ? professor e: We 're saying about twelve hours . And we 're recording only this meeting , like continuously we 're only recording this one now ? or ? professor e: No . No , so the the that 's the that 's the biggest one  , chunk so far , grad g: Nope . phd c: Do they meet every week , professor e: And then there phd c: or every professor e: they do . w w And we talked to them about recording some more and we 're going to , we 've started having a morning meeting , today  i starting a w a week or two ago , on the  front - end issues , and we 're recording those ,  there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded , phd c: Great . So actually , we 're gonna h start having a a pretty significant chunk and so , you know , Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff things like that , now that  the things are starting to happen . So right now , yeah , I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings , but there are scattered other meetings in it and that that amount is gonna grow  so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately i if we 're if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , you know , twenty or thirty percent of it , not not not eighty or ninety . phd c: So there 's probably there 's three to four a week , grad g: That 's what we 're aiming for . professor e: Yeah and th the the other thing is I 'm not pos I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times , that I really don't know maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty , but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .  in fact , the morning group is really motivated cuz they 're working on connected digits , so it 's grad g: Actually that 's something I wanted to ask , is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits . grad g: We don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and I have those . grad g: And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance .  , if I did that , is someone gonna be working on it ? professor e: yeah , I I think definitely s so Absolutely . grad g: is it something of interest ? professor e: Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that .  , I I 'm I 'm interested in it , I just don't have time to do it now . phd f: I was these meetings I 'm sure someone thought of this , but these this  reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do  adaptation . phd c: Actually I have o grad g: I I would really like someone to do adaptation . grad g: So if we got someone interested in that , I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder . professor e: Well  , one of the things I wanted to do , that I I talked to to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation , grad g: Since it 's the same people over and over . professor e: to try to get rid of some of the effects of the the the far - field effects .  ,  we have the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation phd f:   professor e: because people move around , and  , if if it 's if it 's  not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's it 's it 's you can't really do inversion , phd f:   professor e: and even echo cancellation is going to  be something It may you Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we 've taken is more \" lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal \" . But it occurred to me a few months ago that  party lines are always , you know , sort of dangerous . And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do . So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close  mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation .  , there was a have been some nice talks recently by by Lucent on on their b phd f:  . professor e: the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me ,  you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . And  , you know , th phd a: W what is the  the artifact you try to you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ? phd f: Ciao . professor e:  so it 's it you have a a direct   , what 's the difference in If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would  phd f: I 'm signing off . that would subtract off the   parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so so   I guess in most echo cancellation Yeah , so you Given that  Yeah , so you 're trying to So you 'd There 's a a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the there 's a a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract essentially to subtract off  different  different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had you had some  some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a there 's an echo . phd a: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those .  , just the raw data , you would you might hear kind of an echo ? And and then this noise cancellation would get professor e: Well , I 'm I 'm I 'm saying That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening . What 's really happening is Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you  try to r you To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I but not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the the room response , but just to try to   eliminate some of the the effect of some of the echos .  , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone ,  it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . You say I I I want to use this  this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this this filtered version  of the speech  gets   gets subtracted off from the original speech . phd a: Kind of a clean up thing , that professor e: It 's a clean up thing . professor e: So , echo cancelling is is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and and and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike . phd a: When  , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a  some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was  And then it would come on and it was very clear , professor e: Yeah . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So  ,  anyway that 's that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try somebody look And and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was  large vocabulary speech or anything .  postdoc b: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ? professor e: Brian 's Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that  doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible ,  i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know There 's also  oh yeah , noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those those echos . But  if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right you know , right right  delays are is ,  is right delayed signal is is is  is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , also in a in a situation that 's very reverberant with long reverberation times and really long delays , it 's it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a a c a complete inversion , if you actually I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics .  , that 's difficult because  often times the the  the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually  , you know , rings , and and  goes to infinity . So it 's so there 's there 's there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents  there 's all sorts of all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons ,  we we we sort of  , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and  we decided to do this approach of taking  , just picking  features , which were  will give you more something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . I guess you you actually already said this thing about the  about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to So this was the human subjects folks who said this , or that that ? postdoc b: The a apparently  , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course .  but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it that often , but  just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .  , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that that we have . We have we have an hour  that that is transcribed , we have we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going ,  by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we if this really  Well , do we have that much ? phd c: Not really . professor e: Let 's see , we have phd c: So that 's what You know , that professor e:  eight weeks ,  is phd c: So that 's not a lot of hours . professor e: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's Yeah , so like thirty thirty hours ? phd a: Three Three hours .  I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with  energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves , professor e: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester . phd c: so professor e: Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours . phd c: is there Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of deci  , that are less well I don't  , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong grad g: We had some good ones earlier . phd c: There 's laughter ,  I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or grad g: I think it 's hard to record those . phd c: To be allowed to record them ? postdoc b: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards . professor e: Yeah , people will get postdoc b: But I but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea . So I I  , I I 'd mentioned to Adam , and that was another thing I was gonna talk  , mention to them before that  there 's  It it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to  acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , that that  it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a ,  or and and so it doesn't really give us the the the  characteristics we want . But  , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show , or this you know , this discussion show , and  can you record multi - channel ? \" And  they may be willing to record it  with phd c: With lapel mikes or something ? professor e: Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant . professor e: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they they they start recording , isn't als also is not going to be this exact setup . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live ,  that we could invite them to have like some of their record some of their shows here . postdoc b: Wow ! phd c: Well Or The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount  , they 're on the radio , grad g: Right , as we are . phd c: Th - that 's an a side of style a style that we 're not collecting here , so it 'd be great . professor e: And and the  , the other side to it was the what which is where we were coming from I 'll I 'll talk to you more about it later is that is that there 's there 's  the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably ,  related to , you know , legal issues and and permissions and all that . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and  and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . The thing was , I was hoping that we could @ @ in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . Yeah I was mostly trying to think , \" OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with . And you you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your your data for awhile so  right now and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM right ? Do Oh , do we now ? professor e: Well , we don't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was phd c: So  , not complaining , I was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus  six months from now professor e: Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like , grad g: Right . professor e: and and and  and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can you can do a lot of other things . phd c: Cuz I 'm not actually sure , just logistically that I can spend you know , I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time . phd c:  anyway , I shouldn't say too much , but  if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person . And so it 's professor e: i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now .  , three months from now  ,  the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , unreasonable to say that  in January , you know , ro roughly  which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours . phd c: And we just don't know about the transcription part of that , professor e: So that 's postdoc b: Yeah , we need to I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards , phd c: so .  , it postdoc b: and  es especially since these people won't be  used to dealing with multi - channel  transcriptions . postdoc b: So I think that we 'll need to adjust some And also if we wanna add things like  , well , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through . There 'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several  , you know , friends , and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to , right ? professor e: If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @  , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions , but I think if it 's a real Why not ? Yeah . postdoc b: You could do this , phd c: Well yeah , postdoc b: you know . phd c: or just if you 're if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't  have them do the digits , or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it was , you know , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do . grad g: We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to . phd c: Then , having the data is very valuable , cuz I think it 's  politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data , especially with the ITR , if we put in a proposal on it .  , whether it 's transcribed or not  , is another issue , but there 's there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions , or at least that you can start to answer . phd a: Would it help at all  , we 're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings . One is   without doing the digits Or , I guess the full - blown one is where you do the digits , and everything , and then talk about doing it without digits , what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff . I 'm really scared grad g: It seems like it 's a big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes . phd c:  or at least , like , me personally ? I would I couldn't use that data . phd c: So it 's a great idea , professor e: Yeah , I I b By the by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck . phd c: and if it were true than I would just do that , but it 's not that bad like the room is not the bottleneck , and we have enough time in the room , it 's getting the people to come in and put on the and get the setup going . Right ? And and  d Do you have any idea when when  the you 'll be able to send  the ten hours to them ? grad g: Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have . So early next week we send it to them , and then then we check with them to see if they 've got it and we we start , you know asking about the timing for it . professor e: So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on . professor e: Right ? grad g: Yeah , but professor e: Well grad g: Yeah , who knows where they are . professor e: Yeah , but You know , so they they they have you know , they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do , phd c: What if grad g: Yeah , you we can't complain . professor e: right ? But they But at any rate , they 'll I I think once they get that sorted out , they 're they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they who 's who is doing it , and  I think it 's not going to be I don't think it 's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour , I think . phd c: Really ? So it 's the amount of professor e: It 's it 's just getting it going . phd c: I don't know , if there 's any way without too much more overhead , even if we don't ship it right away to IBM even if we just collect it here for awhile , to record you know , two or three more meeting a week , just to have the data , even if they 're  not doing the digits , but they do wear the headphones ? professor e: But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and phd c: No , I meant , sorry , the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs , maybe they don't wanna be recorded , but grad g: Oh , and we 're just chatting ? phd c: Just the ch the chatting . phd c: I actually I actually think that 's useful data ,  the chatting , grad g: Yeah , the problem with that is I would I think I would feel a little constrained to You know ?  , some of the meetings phd c: but OK . phd c: Alright , so I 'll just throw it out there , if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI ,  that we could record , I think it would be worth it . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW   really m a lot more than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus , grad g: Right . phd a: Is the  , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ? professor e: they seem to have some problems with it .  , but , again , Jerry is Jerry 's open So  , we have two speech meetings , one  network meeting ,  Jerry was open to it but I I s One of the things that I think is a little a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved  in our work , we probably can't do it every week . You know ? I I I I think that that people are gonna feel  are gonna feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . And the then so then they can just really sort of try to put the mikes on and then just charge in and grad g: Yep . phd c: What if we give people you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ? postdoc b: Well , you know , I I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise . postdoc b: But I had another question , which is  , you know , in principle , w  , I know that you don't want artificial topics , phd c: Alright , alright , alright . postdoc b: but  it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial . postdoc b: and i you know , people who are Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the the  goldibears goldi goldilocks , it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small . And  a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word . phd a: Well , even  , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about postdoc b: We could pay subjects . phd a: or what about people in the in the building ? phd c: Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo phd a: there 's the State of California downstairs , and phd c: Yeah .  grad g: I just really doubt that  any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public . grad g: So I  I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition phd c: Alright , well . grad g: and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said \" well maybe we could have meetings down here \" , but then I got email from them that said \" no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . phd a: What about Joachim , maybe he can professor e: But but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . professor e:  i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but phd a: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones . phd c: Well , and they 're already they 're these things are already recorded , grad g: Yep . phd c: we don't have to ask them to even and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual professor e: n Well No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones phd c: Why why not ? professor e: because because because we would be asking them to do something different . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested  in in LDC getting data , and professor e: Right , that 's the found data idea . professor e: But what I 'm saying is  if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere phd c: Right .   professor e: and  But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they  might be e e willing to the I might be able to talk them into it . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here . Well I don't why don't we why d u why don't we   turn them turn grad g: OK , leave leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time <doc-sep>And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to \" Session \" , and write MR eleven . grad c: And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's gets marked as unread , unused . grad c: There 's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work correctly . Any agenda items today ? grad c: I wanna talk a little bit about getting how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to how to finish it up . postdoc f: I wanna ask about  , some aud audio monitoring on some of the  well some of the equipment . postdoc f: Ba - based on some of the tran  i In listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , grad c: Oh really . postdoc f: so I phd b: \" Spikes \" , you mean like  , instantaneous click type spikes , or ? postdoc f:   grad c: It could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . Well maybe Then we don't really have to talk about that as an phd b: You could try an experiment and say \" OK , I 'm about to test for spikes \" , postdoc f: I I take that off the agenda . phd b: and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . phd b: \" Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . phd b: No I 'm just  professor e: were this a professional audio recording , what we would do what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance . I guess I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on  , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . professor e: And then  , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , agendas . Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about discussion about something that he  strongly cares about then he would come and And I think part of part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the because of  the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing grad c: Mmm . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's he 's So ,  in order I 'd I think that this is a wish on his part . It 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times  things come up that are unanticipated and and grad c: Right . professor e: But  , we could try anyway , do another try at coming up with the agenda  , at some point before the meeting , say the day before . grad c: Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . phd b: That 'll be I think that 'll help grad c: I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done . professor e: Yeah , I have to tell you for the  for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that  every time before an admin meeting . phd b: I would I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . grad c: Yeah , actually I I was going to say we need to talk about that too . First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in , phd a:  grad c: and get people 's opinions on on what they think of them . professor e: So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? grad c: well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . grad c: And So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . professor e: So let 's see we grad c: Right ? So we could have up to nine . grad c: And it 's  , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel . So yeah so the only Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and and then just go ahead and order them . grad c: No , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working , phd b: OK . grad c: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . phd b: Three wireds work , professor e: Basically we found phd b: right ? grad c: I I guess three wireds work , yeah . professor e: And so  , we we seem to have  , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . grad c: Everyone 's battery OK ? phd b: I checked them this morning , they should be . But the quality seems really good and  I heard from UW that they 're they 're  very close to getting their ,  setup purchased . They 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c: Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that . grad c: They got sa apparent Well , Maybe this needs to be bleeped out ? I have no clue . But anyway there 's there 's there 's  ,  other activities that are going on there and and  and NIST and UW . But but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the Sony , grad c: Right . Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ? grad c: no , we 're having the them do it . professor e: No ? grad c: So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it . professor e: OK , so that 's being done professionally and grad c: I  professor e: Yeah . professor e: Well , it could if they do a lot of it , it 's grad c:  i it 's just their repair shop . grad c: And ,  we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . So , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . I guess Was the decision last time was that the the  transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? Has that started , or is that ? postdoc f:   grad c: Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . And  , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the  transcribers use different tools . So he has a nice set up that they it w it will be efficient for them to do that . professor e: So anyway grad c: So , you know , just  , a matter of a few days I suspect . professor e: So anyway I think we we have at least one  , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave . grad c: So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also .  , is Dave I don't know if Dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings ,  if he knows . grad c: we don't have a active one but I 'll make sure he 's on the list . Should we call him ?  is he d is he definitely not available today ? professor e: I don't know . phd a: Yeah , he was in s postdoc f: He wasn't there at cof professor e: Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him . grad c: Yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like Tuesdays and Thursdays ? phd a: I think he has a class . grad d: Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now . professor e: And the and the recordings also , postdoc f:  professor e: just where we are . postdoc f: Well , so  , should we we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or ? grad c: Well , we have about thirty - two hours  as of , I guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours . professor e: And and that 's that 's  How much of that is digits ? It 's  that 's including digits , grad c: That 's including digits . professor e: right ? grad c: I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits . So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of There 's got to be more than thirty hour phd a: Mmm . grad c: Of of non - digits ? professor e: i it couldn't of Of non - digits . postdoc f: OK , and the transcribers h I , don't have the exact numbers , but I think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished  , transcribing from them right now . The next step is to that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . What  by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that  , Liz requested in terms of  ,  in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . And you know , so how you could grad c: Nine two , postdoc f: e Exactly . postdoc f: So if you just say \" nine two \" , the there are many s ways that could have been expressed . An - and I just had them I  , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , a gloss th and things . phd b: one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things , if you  , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis grad c: Misspelled . postdoc f: You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . Y you mean just  on each on each line there 's a one word right ? It 's one token from the from the corpus . postdoc f: Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I I agree that 's a very good use of it . postdoc f: Well that 's that 's a way that 's You know , the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and  , postdoc f: Exactly . phd b: i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and and so it makes it easier . And that was that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . I didn't get to that point but So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then  , there 's a he she wants the  , actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either \" VOC \" for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , \" NONVOC \" for door - slam , and \" GLOSS \" for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error . postdoc f: but I I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most ha most efficiently handled by  by a a filter . So that , you know you get a whole long list exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say \" curly bracket laugh curly bracket \" , phd b:   postdoc f: then y you know it 's it 's You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space , phd b: Yeah . postdoc f: So ,  I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged  , subcategorized comments , and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying , phd b:   postdoc f: you end up with a s with  , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens phd b:   But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know  , jus grad c: You don't know what they could be . postdoc f: Yeah now TIMIT 's clear  and PLP is clear but  there are things that are not so well known , in or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say \" nine two \" or you can say \" ninety - two \" , grad c: So how are you doing the postdoc f: and  I 'd handle the numbers individually . grad c: How are you doing the  , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ? postdoc f: It would be separate The letters would be separated in space grad c: OK . postdoc f: and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is , grad c:   Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is  , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's  the you know ,  enumerated , or i grad c:   postdoc f: it 's not a good way of saying but it 's it 's the specific  way of stating these these letters . postdoc f: And so anyway , the clean those are those things and then channelized is to then  , get it into this multichannel format . But that 's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized , the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins . postdoc f: And  , Thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based   s s speech - nonspeech segmentation  , up and running and I haven't I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized . phd a: I actually gave grad c: Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ? postdoc f: Oh yes . I spent  actually  I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers , grad c: Oh good . postdoc f: and I went through it last night , it 's it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I I left them discretion at commas . postdoc f:  and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions . postdoc f: And  , and so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in in huge patches of the data . And and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . So  , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up \" gobbledy - gook \" . And on this side , this one 's picking up things like \" neural nets \" and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the  colloquial didn't . phd b: When for the person who missed \" gobbledy - gook \" what did they put ? postdoc f: It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . postdoc f: So they tried to approximate it , but it was phd b: Oh good . More of an attempt to  apparently it was very clear to her that these the a this this was a sound these are the sounds , grad c: It was a technical term that she didn't recognize , phd b: Yeah . But she even though her technical perception is just really  you know I 've I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses grad c: Right . postdoc f: then cuz \" neural nets \" and oh she has some things that are oh \" downsampled \" , she got that right . postdoc f: But ch ten solid  m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data . professor e: And and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ? postdoc f: And  professor e: Is that right ? postdoc f: Yes exactly . professor e: So let 's say roughly ten hours or so of postdoc f:   postdoc f: It 'd be more than that because I my recollection is the minutes that da digits don't take more than half a minute . postdoc f: But  the the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape , professor e: Oh , I see . postdoc f: So they 're still working some of them are Two of them are still working on completing that . professor e: So what what what 's the deal with with your phd a: The channel u thing ? professor e: Yeah . phd a: Oh , it 's just  , I ran the recognizer  , the speech - nonspeech detector on different channels and , it 's just in  in this new multi - channel format and output , and I just gave one one meeting to to Liz who wanted to to try it for for the recognizer professor e: Oh , I see . phd a: as  , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever , professor e: Right . So , I hope grad c: Is this anything different than the  system you were using before ? professor e: Yeah . phd a: There is some ,  as the energy is normalized across channels grad c: You know what  ? Across all of them . What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ? You said you 're trying some different features , or something . phd a: Oh I just  Mmm , I just use  our loudness - based things now as they before there were they were some in in the log domain and I I changed this to the to the professor e: Cu - Cube root ? phd a: Yeah . To No , I changed this to the to the to the loudness thingy with the with the grad c:  . Yeah , and I and I tried t to normalize   the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , within one channel , professor e: OK . phd a: because they 're , yeah to to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . I think the  Were were you basically done with the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this  bleep editing . So the The idea is that we need to have We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages ,  with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , professor e: Yeah . And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . professor e: I I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed .  if people have  , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . professor e: And , I   it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare . grad c: Right ,  so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for other reasons . grad c: And so that that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready ,  I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just  , tell them , \" here 's the web page \" , \" you need a password \" . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it . professor e: That 's I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say \" here is a here is \"  this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , \" here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK \" . grad c: I think that  there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . These are big , and I would much rather be ha be able to just sit and leaf through it . professor e: You find it easier to go through a large  how do you read books ? grad c: Well I certainly read books by hand . professor e: Really ?  , it grad c: Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I I 'm I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these . professor e: Going to a web site is easy , but flipping through a hundred pounds a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web . grad c: Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper . So are you thinking that  the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? Because I I do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the professor e: So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong , postdoc f: Yeah . professor e: but the way I imagined it was that  , the largest set of people is gonna go \" oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the where 's the release ? \" And then there 'll be a subset of people , right ? OK there 's  think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . professor e: OK there 'll be a subset of people , who  , will say  \" well , yeah , I really would like to see that . \" And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document ,  unless you 're searching . Searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that , phd a: Yeah .  if if  you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document ,  whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out .  , so it 's it 's  , you you 're you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where where I  , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go \"  you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , \" and then that group would need it S It seems like i if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . So that  , now we have to worry about privacy , grad c: Well , no fre for the most professor e: we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people grad c: For the most frequent case they just say \" it 's OK \" and then they 're done . postdoc f: The other thing too is it seems like professor e: yeah , that 's true . grad c: cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to . grad c: Oh that was another thing I I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it that an email approval was sufficient . phd b: Are are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ? grad c: Yes . If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I I I think they should be allowed to do that . phd b: So that means other people are editing what you say ? professor e:  I don't know about that . grad c: Well , the only other choice is that the person would say \" no , don't distribute this meeting at all \" , and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say \" don't distribute it at all \" . professor e: But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice . grad c: Well , but if if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient . grad c: If I say \" we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , \" and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side . postdoc f: The I agree that the consent forms were  , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that  , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them . postdoc f: And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that  , we wouldn't want someone to say \" oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but it was too hard to access \" . Now in terms of like editing it by hand ,  I think it 's i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited . But but it seems to me that sometimes  , you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK . professor e:   it 's also a mixture of people ,  some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . You know ? grad c: Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former . grad c: And that Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright . I I think grad c: OK , so does that mean that I can't use email ? Or what ? postdoc f: Cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking . professor e: I I th grad c: Well , I don't think I professor e: well we there was this grad c: well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues . So giving them , you think a web site to say , \" if you wanna print it out here it is \" , is not sufficient ? postdoc f: Good point . I professor e: Certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient . grad c: Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them . professor e: I 'm just wondering about postdoc f: You could mail it to them . phd a: But postdoc f: But I think it 's easier to drop in the box . phd a: Just put the button on on the web page which say \" please send me the the scripts \" . phd b: What  When you display it on the web page , what are what are you showing them ? Utterances , or ? grad c:   phd b: And so can they bleep within an utterance ? grad c: No . grad c: And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's  ,  it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level . Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand . professor e: There 's another aspect to this which maybe is part of why this is bothering me .  , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this . grad c:  that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient . You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go . Because nob you know it There was a one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , but overall people are talking about technical topics . You know , this is this we 're we 're covering We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're we 're we 're looking for the extreme case . If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache . That I think that 's I 'm sort of psyching myself out here , I I 'm trying to  grad c: I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out . professor e: but I I think that 's Well , it 's grad c: So . phd b: I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped . I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there that 's missing from the dialogue . professor e: You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , phd a: Yeah . And , you know where it 's really gonna hurt somebody , in some way the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . And and  , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , and so much fun ! that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff . professor e: and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so \" well I didn't like what he said .  , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like . No , no , I I I don't grad c: The only question is professor e: You - you 've talked me into that , but I I just think that we should make it harder to do . grad c: The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me . Whereas this web interface , I just get email , it 's all formatted , it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it . professor e: So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it . professor e: I 'm sorry so so So maybe this is a s a way out of it . professor e: You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do handle , and useful for someone else if they need it . But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that  , they get access to this if they really need it . grad c: Well phd b: So you 're saying the the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting . grad c: Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords . professor e: There 's there grad c: So , professor e: y but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying . grad c: what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure . professor e: We 're We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l  fall off a log , to do this . professor e: Right ? So th so what I would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the postdoc f: Yeah . professor e: not just for fun , OK ? but to to check this for  things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at from their memory .  and , and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that 's worded , OK ? Then , if someone  wants to review it , and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that is that we then give them a print out . And then if they say that \" I have a potential problem with these things , \" then , you you say \" OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that , \" you issue them a password , i in the grad c: But the the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me . professor e: I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble grad c: Yeah . professor e: we have grad c: So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen . postdoc f: I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing . Cuz I think if they feel that  , it 's I th I th You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , but but they might be able to argue \" oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down \" . So I 'm a little bit worried about  , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint . professor e: Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think , postdoc f: Yeah . grad c: It seems to me that sending them email , saying \" if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK , professor e: because  - huh . grad c: If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password \" , seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise . postdoc f:  we could offer that but but there 's  , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . postdoc f: I don't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage .  I I thought that you were Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it 's professor e: Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean , that having it grad c: Having it . grad c: Well the in professor e: right ? It just means they have the right to have it . grad c: the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it , postdoc f: Alright . grad c: D you want me to grab one ? postdoc f: Sh - sh well I could I 'm closer . grad c: Yeah , but you 're wired postdoc f: I could grad c: aren't you ? postdoc f: Yeah . Yeah ,  I don't wanna fool them , postdoc f: I don't know professor e: I just meant that e every ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a a bias that is presented , postdoc f: Oh yeah yeah oh I know . professor e: right ? grad c: \" If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . grad c: \" Once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r larger research community . grad c: There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . grad c: Well ,  it The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said . professor e: Yeah ,  no that it tha postdoc f: Tha - that 's true . postdoc f: And it doesn't really say we 'll send it to you , or wi it 'll be available for you on the web , or anything .  like like Morgan was saying they they grad c: They just have to make sure that it is available to them . wh  I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , it 's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . So I I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very ,  nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . professor e: That that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out , postdoc f: Good . But if you really think something is gonna And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that that is hurt by our expressing that bias . professor e: you know you might be right , it may be it was just paranoia on my part ,  but people just See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just as just because they can . grad c: It 's just a check box next to the text , it 's not any fun at all . professor e: I grad c: All no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time . professor e: Oh they won't ? grad c: It just sends me professor e: Oh good . professor e: OK , grad c: And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps .  I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data professor e: Yeah . grad c: because  , then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space . grad c: So I I wanna I just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it . Alright , so I think Yeah so if we have if i Again let 's you know , sort of circulate the the wording on each of these things and get it right , grad c: Well since you seem to feel heart  , strongest about it , would you like to do the first pass ? professor e: but but OK . Turn about is fair play , postdoc f: Al - Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that that Adam 's raised ,  about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever professor e: Sorry . i There 's something down there about \" if you agree to \" professor e: I 'm I 'm I 'm I thought I I thought about it with one of my background processes grad c: I don't think so . professor e: and I  it 's  it 's  , it 's fine to do the email . grad c: Yeah because thi th they 're signing here that they 're agreeing to the paragraph which says \" you 'll be given an opportunity . professor e: And Well and furthermore I it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that that  if it 's if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying  \" OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , \"  if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now grad c: Right . grad c: So I guess I probably should at the minimum , think about how to present it in a printed form . The problem is a lot of them are really short , postdoc f: Well grad c: and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line . postdoc f: Well I s I also have this I I think it 's nice you have it  , viewab her hearable on the on the web for those who might wonder about  , the non nonverbal side ,  I I agree that our bias should be as as expressed here , and but I I think it 's nice that a person could check . Cuz sometimes you know you the words on a on the page , come out soun sounding different in terms of the social dynamics if they hear it . postdoc f: And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people you know , shouldn't borrow trouble . What it comes down to but grad c: Yeah I think actually my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is  not good . postdoc f: Oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole  i segment a against some personal i th grad c: Right . grad c: I think Microsoft is postdoc f: Yeah exactly phd a: Oh , grad c: Sorry transcribers . postdoc f: Or or even or even there was a a line you know about how \"  - mmm - mmm Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . postdoc f: but but it was all the words were all visible , but they didn't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript .  , I I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it that nothing will slip by . professor e: But it the some something might sometime , and they  if if it 's something that they said , they might i i  , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said , postdoc f:   professor e: but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant . phd b: how do you how do you indicate sarcasm ? postdoc f: Yeah that 's right . So the so i the so we might we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was , you know , not not really what I said . grad c: So  , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it , phone and in person . postdoc f: You know I just realized something , which is of e th this question about the  the possible mismatch of  i well , and actually also the lawyer saying that  , we shouldn't really have them have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks . So it 's like i in a way it 's it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and and hear the transcript , to have that be the professor e: Well yeah , but you can't dep  , most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though . professor e: And they they have to postdoc f: So it 's not it 's not  Yeah , good . professor e: But  if you were at a meeting , and and you you don't think , at least , that you said anything funny and the meeting was about , you know , some some funny thing about semantics or something , or  grad c: You probably won't listen to it . postdoc f: It is true that tec that the content is technical , I and so i and we 're not having these discussions which professor e: Yeah . postdoc f: I  , when I listen to these things , I don't find things that are questionable , in other people 's speech or in my own . professor e:  we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have postdoc f: Yeah . Actually , I was gonna Di - Did you have anything n that 's going on , or grad d: Not really .  , my project is going along but  , I 'm really just here to  fill the project  the overall progress . grad c:   professor e: Transcribers , he was rattling the b marbles in his brain back and forth just then this this grad c: Shall we do digits ? professor e: Oh yeah . grad c: oh by the way I did find a bunch grad d: It  grad c: we should count out how many more digits to forms do we have back there ? phd b: There were quite a few . I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them , that were blanks , that no one had actually read . postdoc f: Oh , did you do that ? phd a: Burger King grad c: I 'd like a burger with that , phd b: No I never did "

        "Summary": "The remote control design should prioritize functionality, with a focus on a comfortable fit, clear and obvious functions, and legible text. The appearance of the remote should be visually appealing and eye-catching. To meet the Christmas deadline and stay ahead of competition, the remote needs to be in the market soon. The trend for that year was fruit and vegetable shapes, along with a soft and spongy feel. The star features of the remote should be narrowed down to one or two, with voice recognition as a potential option. Marketing identified three key findings: a fancy look and feel, innovative technology, and high ease of use. They aimed to combine these findings with the trendy fruit and vegetable theme and sponge material, while considering the preferences of both the elder and young markets. Specific topics discussed included color design, related symbols and pictures, and the placement of the business logo. Marketing highlighted three main inspirations: the customer's desire for fashion in electronics, the simplicity of technology, and the importance of aesthetics in the remote's shape and color. Evaluation criteria were established, focusing on a fancy look and feel, innovativeness, and ease of use. The Industrial Designer and User Interface teams scored the prototypes, with emphasis on look and feel, innovativeness, and ease of use. The decision was made to create a remote control without an LCD screen, improving the design to make it more visually appealing. All functions would be included in the same set, but some, like speech recognition, would be optional. The team would also explore different shapes and materials for the remote.",
        "Article": "I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes ,  and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting .  , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the  second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not  quite okay . It  it  still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that  were layered over each other . project manager: But  , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard . industrial designer: Okay , when we talk about  components design ,  it's really about the material and the and   really the stuff we build  the remote controls of . We have to choose th  these  wisely and it could affect   a kind of grow of in  in buying  the remote controls .  the properties of the case ,  it has to be solid  in hard material like  hard plastic  with soft rubber for  falling and and   yeah , it feels  good in your hand .   they're telling me that  when we build  a remote control of  of plastic or rubber , the  buttons have to be  rubber too . I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to  the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t  three-dimensional  curve in the in the design , which is  necessary when we want to be trendy .  ,  the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its  its non  non-depending of of of    here you have to have a hand  yeah , kinetic  energy . Also in  this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push  a button and so you don't have to  walk with it all the all the time . marketing: project manager: industrial designer:   also the case material ,  I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because  wood or titanium would also be a bit weird .  , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are  just available in  in our  factory .  , it's all  off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all  available in our company . Could be  something special to our  remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be  within the limits of twenty five Euros . industrial designer: I th I got an email with  some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one . user interface: industrial designer: You see  a covers , which can be project manager: What are those , t tooth  brushes , or so user interface: industrial designer: I don't know .  marketing: project manager: But it's actually kind of  user interface: I project manager: well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj industrial designer: Yes . industrial designer: Yes , maybe we can  bri  bring a couple of  couple of types of  project manager: And we can we can steal their ideas . industrial designer: Maybe we can bring a whole line  with  with a huge variety of  project manager: Well , it's a possibility , too . industrial designer: Like  maybe radios and  television also  in this in this in the same style , but project manager: industrial designer: Yes , because we have to  we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff  back into it . marketing: user interface: I was thinking about just  the basic functions and I got  project manager: Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . Didn't we ? user interface: Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi user interface: I ha I ha I have the I have project manager: Just user interface: nothing . user interface: I dunno if they're maybe a little bit more , but project manager: Well we maybe we can think of that later . project manager: these are the ones you already summed up in the user interface: Yeah , I I  well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier .  , I was also looking for what you said , for I got an email   about  L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . I don't know what kind of information it would user interface: Yeah , I don't know . marketing: Then you project manager: user interface: a little  too A little bit marketing: and then you've got a flag s Very big R_C_ . user interface: It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of marketing: No . And I   thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure  if they have to be big or  just small industrial designer: But you're the expert . user interface: Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness . user interface: Maybe it marketing: Well , if you save  Perhaps  s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course . project manager: user interface: Well  industrial designer: marketing: user interface: okay , that's your point . marketing: user interface: Yeah , I've nothing to s industrial designer: project manager: Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . user interface: I thought so , but maybe with the project manager: Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have yeah , they have to be large . project manager:  th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the to skip channels and to  user interface: Large ? Yeah . project manager: I think yeah , I don't know why , but I think that is that's t trendy too , user interface: Most the most used  buttons . marketing: Those are probably the the th project manager: because that's the mo it it you know , it's  acc acc  accentu  , how do you say it ? It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t marketing: Yes .  I've done some investigation , and  well I  got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and  Milan . And  the third point there in this  order if of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . And  , well , for the idea , I've put some trends  for the market of elderly people . user interface: marketing: The younger market likes  Well , the themes of of this year are  surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . industrial designer: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: I found this image , which is  Well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . But with a little bit of fancy project manager: Well maybe c then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then . I got some ideas user interface: marketing:  well , yeah , pictures isn't really good word , but  industrial designer: marketing: some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . marketing: And  , the docking st industrial designer: marketing:  I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the  remote control itself . But to industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , the To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . And  , we could bring one line with a dark colour  to   p  yeah industrial designer: marketing:   v how do you say ? project manager: For diversity or something .  marketing: Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . user interface: Well , how  industrial designer: marketing:  it it it reaches a different market  , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to  bring  like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . user interface: But how do we use  fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control ? industrial designer: project manager: No , but I I I think that  our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . marketing: Yeah , there's there's always a user interface: make it a banana ? project manager: It's like a pear or something .  I think this part of the R_C_  well the upper the upper part or whatever is  is not not used with buttons , I guess . project manager: No , I don't think you have to do it like industrial designer: user interface: marketing: So you you can put some fruity things project manager: Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . project manager: And so y I I think this y it already sem resembles  something like a pear to me or something . marketing: Especially i user interface: Yeah , but th yeah , but that marketing: Yeah , yeah . project manager: You do get the idea , eh ? The fruity kind of round user interface: Yeah   project manager: 'Kay . marketing: A and we could use one of these for the  w what is it ? project manager: Yeah ,  yeah , I don't know . user interface: But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ? industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , yeah . marketing: And  , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is  is n not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . project manager: No , but I think it's it's already what we were were up to . project manager: it's it doesn't have to resemble  what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . user interface: marketing: B but that's great , and and and what I was project manager: And  , but I do like the marketing: what what I was saying , the catchy colours project manager: yeah , I do like  the f  to the idea of making a a y  , a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too . user interface: But , we we have to  There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own  colours has to be in it . Pictures was a was a bad word , but project manager: Okay , but what are the This is yellow . user interface: A yellow do marketing: If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . project manager: Yeah , on  n  on the bottom of the remote you can do marketing: Well , the button button over here or whatever , user interface: Okay , yeah . project manager: Okay , you can you open the conceptual design presentation ? marketing: Conceptual design , yes . project manager: but I don't think it's there  , yeah  , do we want to  use an L_C_D_ display , for example ? marketing: Well , it's nice , of course . industrial designer: Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . marketing:  project manager: Yeah , but it's so marketing: Yeah , but it should be li like this big , and I don't think industrial designer: No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the with  with  four programmes . marketing: Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because industrial designer: Yes , it can On your No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . project manager: And it's also not I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , user interface: Well well what would you display on it then ? project manager: it's industrial designer: programme  information or or or or g or a guide marketing: Programme information . user interface: But is it isn't that a already on T_V_ , a lot of new T_V_s ? marketing: But industrial designer: on t on teletext , yes . marketing: Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show  when you  zap to a industrial designer: But project manager: But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . marketing: But then we also  w need to bring out a line of T_V_s which we were planning to , user interface: Yeah , project manager: user interface: and we also have to yeah . Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ , and I don't know if that's possible . project manager: marketing: Yes , yes , o of course it's possible , user interface: marketing: but you gotta  implement it in the T_V_s , and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our  remote control . industrial designer: project manager: I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it , user interface: And I also industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: but I I really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted  c When we talk about the materials ,  it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . project manager: But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . marketing: That's true , that's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it's not very solid , it's  frag fragile . You could make it , but it's just it it doesn't I don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: If we wanna user interface: Yeah , I dunno . industrial designer: project manager: And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto  rights . project manager: But did we skip the Yeah , you could do marketing: project manager: m but what what i so what i but do you think we should user interface: Yeah , I don't know .  ,  I i if it's it's a simple p project manager: We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . So user interface: No , that that's right , industrial designer: No   user interface: and  I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . Kind of L_C_D_ or something or industrial designer: Y yes , you can use  buttons   w that are already  on the remote control for double functions . user interface: But how does it display then ? W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ? industrial designer: then you push a button . user interface: About that programme ? industrial designer: But but  yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be  customised to the project manager: Nah , that's not gonna work . industrial designer: But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first marketing: No . industrial designer: you have the biggest  project manager: Do you know th like the the bigger rem  universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes , you can put  a little L_C_D_ display on it with  with lots of information . project manager: But it just it j it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept . But whe but when you put a a a transparent  plastic   screen on top of it , it i it isn't vulnerable . That's maybe not the most important , industrial designer: You can throw with it and project manager: but it's just user interface: Is it fashion ? project manager: I don't think so . industrial designer: When when you put  maybe a colour L_C_D_ t  screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have  a remote control from user interface: I don't know . project manager: Yeah , well do you ha do you have to You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays , have you ? marketing: No . industrial designer: user interface: Because our our motto is we put fashion marketing: Well , I think it's  I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest ,  but  I don't know if if if well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think  we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . project manager: Yeah , but we're gonna if it marketing: did it say a price also  for for  monogramme  L_C_D_ or  coloured L_C_D_ ? user interface: Yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . Coloured marketing: Yeah really , user interface: If you have black and white or something , or grey , that's marketing: if y if you c i project manager: Then  then you better don't yeah , d marketing: I in in two thousand and four you can't  put something on the market which is a monogramme . industrial designer: No , but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or But , I alf I also got a possibility to put  a scroll button on it . But project manager:   I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display . I don't know how well how to with you guys , but I don't really feel it . We already we're  user interface: It's too much  maybe  with with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and project manager: Yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , marketing: Yeah . project manager: and want and it   , do it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft industrial designer: Yes , but o on the marketing: W we've we've gotta find a balance , of course . project manager: I don't think I j  , and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . industrial designer: No , when y project manager: Y we want to it's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an L_C_D_ . industrial designer: Yes , but but when you want to have something special project manager: Yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is industrial designer: Yes , but you had a picture of it from another company . industrial designer: project manager: but no , but it that's industrial designer: project manager: that's our that's our killer feature . marketing: Is that so ? Was it it wasn't just a prototype ? user interface: Well  I  industrial designer: Yes , he have a picture of it . project manager: but re we really have to cut this off , user interface: project manager: I re I know you I I I I I get the idea you really like it , you know , the the L_C_D_ thing , but I I think it's it's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . I don't  , do you guys agre How do you guys think ? I d user interface: No , it's too much . project manager: I'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something .  industrial designer: Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is project manager: Yeah yeah yeah , p Exactly . This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're  we're after , you know , to give it  , you know , the soft touch in your hands marketing: Yeah , for the spongy  feel . industrial designer: Maybe it marketing: industrial designer: but then we have to look that it  w  will not  be too childish to see . And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know , because it may be the design  , it's  maybe it is a bit of the marketing: Yeah . project manager: it's a bit nineties maybe , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point . project manager: Yeah , that's that's true , but but it has to be a little big solid . user interface: But can we ge   project manager: It mustn't be too , n you know , th too overwhelming , then when you put it on your just user interface: Can we combine it or something ?  with  yellow and black ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Well , we can as as I industrial designer: But that's not really fruity . project manager: But marketing: But , i project manager: Okay , but what  , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ? user interface: project manager: industrial designer:  fronts of the We can have  different   fronts of the project manager: Should we do that ? industrial designer: telephone . That's project manager: The materials you  mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay . project manager: O o only only the last point your user interface: And tita  titanium , is  is is it a no ? industrial designer: Yes , project manager: no titanium's not not out of question , I guess . industrial designer: But also w Yes , b bu but when we use s soft project manager: But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so  soft things and t p titanium , as well ? industrial designer:  marketing: Sure . It will  make a huge noise or break other stuff project manager: It will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic , as well . industrial designer: But also on the colours , the young project manager: Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium . Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ? marketing: Yeah , I think it I think it does . industrial designer: Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you're  watching T_V_  or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the user interface: In trendy things . marketing: Yeah , o On the other hand , if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with  user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . project manager: But the question is i then it's , you know , is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it  sturdy and simple and  , know , like  user interface: Yeah . Define project manager: When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . And when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . user interface: Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ? industrial designer: Yes , it's w but it is  plastic . industrial designer: Yes , w we can do that on the on the marketing: What ? user interface: Yeah , he is . 'Kay ,  that that's very  with rubber , so it's very marketing: Oh , yeah . industrial designer: this is  just a project manager: Oh , maybe th maybe this is an marketing: Yeah , I th I think that's difficult , because  that's different material , and then you gotta have like    two material lines of of of industrial designer: No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic . marketing: Yeah , if it's just a colour  which you  which you change then , I guess it's it's nice to have one of these . project manager: No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it . industrial designer:  marketing:  project manager: You know , like the the soft stuff , marketing: Yeah .  , I I didn't got it project manager: But you can't make the plastic give  the ti titanium look . But if you want to la  yeah , last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe marketing: Yeah . project manager: And  and marketing: project manager: maybe we sh should we t I don't know if we should talk about  , how how much time have we got left ? industrial designer: in a lot of other  user interface: I don't know . user interface: What time does industrial designer: in a lot of other product  categories like  even in b in bags industry .  , they began with  t typical  leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon of  of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Like Eastpack  began a revolution with it with all this  kind of bags and and colours and and project manager: You putting in different colours . industrial designer: They have  also  a kind of    roses on it , a and  marketing:  yeah , yeah . But , let's think about the bas industrial designer: Then we can always  use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new  with new colours , new marketing: Yes . project manager: But wha th our basic idea y  , you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic  enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . But ,  do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? Is that the idea ? Is that a good idea ? marketing: How do you mean ? Th th the  base in a in another project manager: How many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're   f  f user interface: The rubber . project manager: Like two-tone colour ? T industrial designer: There there are three  components three components type . industrial designer: You have the buttons , the the case  itself , and the rubber and th marketing: How the buttons yeah . project manager: I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as well should be in another colour . user interface: Or you just make  one colour ,  maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like  marketing: Yeah . project manager: Well , yeah , it's user interface: Not more than two colours I think . industrial designer: Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as well  marketing: Yes , definitely . user interface: The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea . user interface: The volume , teletext and project manager: And maybe want to access a a menu or something . marketing: Yeah , but that's that's I was thinking that's gotta be on the television . user interface: Yeah yeah yeah yeah , b project manager: That's just i the only button only user interface: Yeah , but wha what kind of menu ? project manager: You know , I user interface: Is  isn't that different from every television ? project manager: No , I think most T_V_s have an  a menu nowadays to access the   screen settings . Yeah , if it's c if Yeah , I think it's okay to to add a menu button for  user interface: project manager: But that that covers all the all the other settings . marketing: and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu , then industrial designer: But then you have to put  up and down and  left and right marketing: Yeah . project manager: No , you can use the marketing: Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever . project manager: Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then   ten  rem marketing: yeah . So project manager: Something important about a s  , no ,  which sh  should remind us of the remote itself , I guess . marketing: Are we gonna do something with the  spongy thing there ? project manager: Just use I think the spongy thing already  comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s  side . project manager: And we will make it spongy and and  and  well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with  user interface: marketing: Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours   w project manager: Yeah , but we're gonna have to we really have to think I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you  , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy . project manager: it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to still have to think of how we manage to  to get to that . project manager: But we I think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also , I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . project manager: too much colour maybe m  user interface: Too much colour , i it  when you got it in a living room , it's too much maybe project manager: But our des design experts will  work that out . It has to be project manager: Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . Well , you will read the minutes  in the you can find them in the user interface: Oh , okay , yeah . You see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more  industrial designer: I will make one in the next  twenty minutes <doc-sep>project manager:  in the last meeting  the marketing manager had presented  her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market  this this product at the within the budget  that was given . In addition to that to make it sell , of course ,  the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , marketing: project manager: or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , 'cause  if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work . project manager: Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip marketing: project manager: that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . If too many buttons are pressed ,    child lock  and  maybe a display clock so that people could  you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some kind of a holder  for the for the  item . project manager: interface designer   has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . marketing: project manager: And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite   program on th right from the remote . project manager:  are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? Okay . And  I don't know whether the order matters much  , I don't I don't think so , so whoever w wants user interface: Okay , I can start first . user interface: Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . This messages could be  switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine . project manager: Nine what ? Nine channel  switches ? user interface: Pardon me ? project manager: Nine channel switches ? Is Yeah . user interface: by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . Then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on  v   eh scrolling the channels one by one . user interface: Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . user interface: Then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see  the the subtitles on the screen . user interface: Then there should d  there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . Suddenly if if if   viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the  T_V_ , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can  while talking he can watch the T_V_ . So a remote can be th can be  designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice project manager: user interface: which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel ,  th now the the  yeah , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . user interface: So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . user interface: Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . user interface: So  sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . Yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . marketing: user interface: And this has multi-purpose use , it can be used for T_V_ , it can be used for cable-satellite , it can be used for V_C_R_ , D_V_D_s and audio . project manager: user interface: Can you go on to the next slide ? Yeah , now this is an interface for a chil  for a remote   which a child can use . user interface:  this is user-friendly , it's very attractive and  children can use it as well as they can play with it . user interface: And this this  child  interface has minimum buttons marketing: user interface: and all the important  buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace . user interface: project manager: user interface: So this is No this is a very big , you cannot misplace it anywhere . marketing: user interface: So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose . And the personal preference  would be a spe   to incorporate speech recognisers  which will respond to user's voice for a particular  function .  any comments on  her presentation ? marketing: Well ,  looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . I don't think that we can get  The T-shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , I think it's just funny . marketing:  I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter . user interface: project manager: No , I think the these are her presentations , but  as far as the decision making we getting to that after after marketing: Yeah  . project manager: but if I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation . industrial designer:  this time I'm I'm going to  concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . marketing: industrial designer:  the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , it's like  it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just   , you know , if you if it falls down , then it doesn't break . industrial designer: yeah , and also  using of colouring compon components like  if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so   we have to use  some colouring compone compone components . marketing: industrial designer:  which  we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be  like  the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should  be able to re  resist the  temperature   highs and  high temperatures and low temperatures . And the  other component we should  we have in the remote controller is a resistor  which is like   i it is very very much important for the electricity  flow through through through the  remote controller and  also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery , capacitor . industrial designer:  a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this  technical  electri electronic compons  components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . A battery  , I would like to suggest one thing  if we  if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much . Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one , then  people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w   that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one .  when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , marketing: industrial designer: and then  the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the  chip will know that the number one button was pressed . marketing: industrial designer: It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . Suppose  the  user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will  it will  know which  what what action it has to  do . When you look at the   remote controller  it's it's it this is a normal remote controller . And  if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , marketing: industrial designer: like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , project manager: industrial designer: and also a capac  a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator    yeah , and di and a diode transistor . industrial designer: The electronic components  all of the electronic components have all those  things like a chip and d diode transistors an Yeah , di  can y  you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled  chip  . industrial designer:  you can also see the   the green two green things are  these are they are they are resistors , user interface: industrial designer: and  just beside that you can see a transistor , and a   cylinder shape ,  that one is a capacitor . Actually ,  building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty  easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive .  it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , because   when you when you are building  some circuits some   circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , because  you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like  , you know , you don't need to use wires and all . So th that green  thing is a circuit board , and also you can see  there are b s like   access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated  th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will  it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , yeah ,  integrated circuit . And  like  we have  designed  before we have seen some  few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls .  b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . industrial designer:  and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious  hard dynamo ,  a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use .  and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular  re or an advanced chip on the print ,  also infra it includes the infrared se sender . project manager: Any particular comments by anybody ? marketing:  yeah , on the scroll and the push-button ,  ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ? industrial designer: No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls ,  which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think . industrial designer: Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all . project manager: We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her her thing . marketing:  alright , my method is  I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . And then when I'm out  in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . They don't want to have to squint at small print  , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want  as few buttons as possible , and they don't care for the mode thing .  and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . If we try to tell people it has too many great features ,  the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . project manager: And  so what do we think on the concept marketing: project manager: of the remote ? marketing: You wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ? project manager: Y user interface:  yes , I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . marketing: So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? user interface: This could be  one feature which could be sellable . industrial designer: Yeah , but w marketing: Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature . industrial designer: Yeah , but but I what I'm  very very much doubtful how how  far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own   problems , issues . marketing: Distance problem ? industrial designer: Yeah , it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice , user interface: industrial designer: like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it's  everything so i marketing:  . project manager: Well , you you teach You have to teach  industrial designer: So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think . marketing: user interface: No , it's it's ,  yeah , it it's like your recording of  all   a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user , industrial designer: user interface: I will already record  a question like ,  good morning , industrial designer: Yeah , but Yeah . user interface: So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on . project manager: Okay , before we get too far off here  , the components of the concept is the energy . project manager: User interface concept ,  interface type , supplements marketing: project manager: That will be your area I think , right , Jana . user interface: Supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button . marketing: Well , I think that Yeah , project manager: Oh , like marketing: or or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement . marketing: Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .  our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the  I_D_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and  the U_I_D_ is supposed to  come up with the user interface design , industrial designer: project manager: In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . project manager:  if you have any questions , you know , you you can always  contact me  or  or your coach , I suppose . user interface: marketing: Wherever they're hiding ? industrial designer: project manager: user interface: project manager:  so  I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in   thirty minutes , according to our timetable here <doc-sep>Sorry ? Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? Okay , we've got half an hour for this one  to  discuss the  functional design . project manager:  so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder .  kind of  got to know each other a little bit and  got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss  a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s  just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the The first one is that   the company's decided that teletext is outdated  because of how popular the internet is . Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . project manager:  they've also suggested that we  we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect  how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . So  , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . project manager: And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . marketing: And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? project manager: Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure   th because on the the company website ,  what does it say  something marketing: 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics . project manager: Yeah ,  do they Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext ,  only control the T_V_ , and  and  incorporate the  colour and slogan of the company .  so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ? industrial designer: Nope , we're all set . user interface: Alright  , can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ?  project manager: Oh yeah , of course , yeah .  Right to do the  the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us  some insp inspiration from previous products . user interface:  I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and  I would like to ask you guys for  your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . user interface: having a look at the existing products , I found out that  it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either  a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . It's got only the basic functions  but  it's the same size as the the hard to use one .  so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha from the bottom of it . marketing: M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've  read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of  sort of market research . marketing: But anyway , project manager: Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . industrial designer: Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. marketing:  clunky in what sense , like  h heavier ? Larger ? user interface:  I think it's supposed to be the same size , but  it's got much fewer buttons . It's , you know , it's very spread out marketing: I see , so it's more just basic .  like the one on the left looks quite  quite complicated , and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing .  so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , so maybe you know marketing: project manager: you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , industrial designer: project manager: I think that's a good idea . user interface: do we have any functions that  we'd want on it ? marketing: user interface:  so far I've got  on and off ,  switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . user interface:  they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ .  , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? Would you like marketing: Which was that ? user interface:  the channels like the the numbers on thing ,  marketing: Up the numbers , or the up down ? project manager: God , I wou I would say that's required , marketing: project manager:  there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , marketing: Yeah . project manager: what else ,  So don't need to worry about teletext , marketing: project manager: don't need to worry about V_C_R_ ,  any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , marketing: We don't ? No ? project manager: you know like brightness and contrast ? marketing: Yeah . Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? project manager:  . marketing: We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? user interface:  project manager: I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? user interface: to start with  sort of a bit both ,  we need to find out exactly what we have to have project manager: Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . project manager: so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and marketing: Yep . user interface: There's  on and off ,  volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .  marketing: Well , one one way I would look at this  would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of  like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . marketing:  and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . project manager: Oka marketing: For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up  , project manager: marketing: things like channel and volume  are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top ,  very just very sort of self-explanatory .  so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . project manager:  well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section Have I just lost Oh no .  ,  do you think maybe that's the only kind of  essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . project manager:  okay , industrial designer: project manager: if we can move on to next presentation then please . project manager: Do you wanna user interface: Do you want to switch places ? marketing: Can this can this pl reach ? Can this plug come across ? industrial designer: No . marketing: Here , I'll just Why don't I just user interface: Just just switch them . marketing:  er , can you go up behind me ? Kinda This is so This project manager: bit complicated . It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ? marketing: I'm all in a knot now . So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of  redundancy in the in the the issues and the the  the things . marketing: Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so  so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely . marketing: Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what  like market research  that that I've been project manager: Okay . marketing: So how do I how do I get this up ? industrial designer:  function F_ eight . Just  Before I bring this up what I'll just say is  what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing . And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what  , so . So  does that make sense ? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . So  I'm thinking here about  primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with  existing products .  to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics .  and then , as I say  w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and  project manager: industrial designer: Bouncing on top . marketing: So this is what I've found here ,  a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together .  the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for  slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . marketing: So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different  inspirations , you know , one is that we want  something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . This is  why I mention when Craig was  showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . industrial designer: Is installing a new remote control something that people marketing: no , that did not come up at all . And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . marketing:  people  additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can  put that into a unit which is which people like . marketing: Yeah , so you know just c looking at what what Craig  Craig's i  ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and  separate the different things that we wanna include in this . So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . That's s that's sort of the  But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . marketing:  I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . marketing: So Alright ? Any  comments on all of that ? project manager: Well ,  one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be  who's our our target audience , our target market . marketing: That's  project manager: so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? marketing: Yeah . Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , marketing: Yeah . project manager: well I don't I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . project manager: But you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one . industrial designer: I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? project manager: It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think . industrial designer: Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? project manager: Yeah , marketing: industrial designer:  so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . industrial designer: You know how much ? I dunno I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? project manager: Okay .  if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: would you how much would you pay ? marketing: This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . marketing: and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . project manager: Okay marketing: Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is . project manager: Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? industrial designer: Yep . user interface:  project manager:  do you think then  voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? What what do you think , Craig ? user interface: Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? Sort of the the older group . user interface:  f marketing: It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , project manager: N yeah . marketing: in terms of project manager: I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want marketing: Okay . project manager: and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . project manager: Just kind of young professionals ,  th like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . industrial designer: I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . project manager: You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . industrial designer: I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , marketing: industrial designer: I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five , marketing: industrial designer: but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . industrial designer: So these are people who are gadgety , right ? project manager: So marketing: industrial designer: People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: when you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular project manager: Yeah . project manager:  okay , so  industrial designer: project manager: so shall we make the decision  to include speech recognition marketing: If we can . industrial designer: I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , project manager: if we can . industrial designer: because  , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . Why is that ? industrial designer: You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . marketing: Could it be an on off thing ? industrial designer: marketing: Like if you want it on industrial designer: but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , project manager: Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . industrial designer: anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . project manager:  might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're marketing: Yeah , it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . marketing:  project manager: Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it  speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people  maybe with a physical disability as well . marketing: like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different  design features together project manager: marketing: that they user interface: I reckon one problem with speech recognition is  I've actually seen one of them used and  the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . project manager: Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? user interface:  I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in .  I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . industrial designer: We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down  exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like Besides the basics , I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target .  are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? marketing: industrial designer:  and I just the idea is just to get everybody to  I usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic , so , you know , things that to start everything going . But I guess everybody does have some idea , so I don't think  there's a need for that . industrial designer: from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need  in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . industrial designer:  and that power source is important because it ties you down to  how long the device will last . That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there .  Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . industrial designer: You know , and that  picks up an input from a user ,   a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . industrial designer:  and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . It's fairly general ,  and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , project manager: industrial designer: like  voice recognition , right , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . industrial designer: but  these are functionally , you know , the base , marketing: industrial designer: I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? I think that's more relevant to a discussion ? project manager:  . project manager: Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? marketing: Sure . Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing . marketing: And like on the means b industrial designer: I guess this would be marketing: Since we're on the topic of the technology ,  are there any like what are our options ? industrial designer: Yep . marketing: Alright , what's what i in Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin industrial designer: these these aren't technology options in that sense . industrial designer: For example , if you needed  if you needed to add  a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , project manager: industrial designer: but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter ,  and the receiver , okay , project manager: industrial designer:  and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . industrial designer:  there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . industrial designer: Okay ,  are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? project manager: Okay . project manager: Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect  how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about  how we transmit it industrial designer: Yep . project manager:  because  it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha industrial designer: There might be one other problem with the transmission ,  in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition .  if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . industrial designer: it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight  say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . industrial designer: but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process .  does c is our controller is it have the option of being  on a standard  frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? industrial designer: There's there's not much specific specific information , project manager: W industrial designer: but I think that  one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . project manager: In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , industrial designer: marketing: Just to T_V_ , okay . project manager: is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ?  is that something we really want to go into , do you think , industrial designer: There's a there's project manager: or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? industrial designer: Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , project manager: -huh . marketing: project manager: Okay , industrial designer:  and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . industrial designer: But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . So basically the  I'm just gonna just recap  what I said at the start , was that  the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , industrial designer: project manager: and what exactly the product's gonna do . project manager: Are we all happy about the idea of  aiming the product at  the fifteen to thirty five bracket ?  and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . project manager: user interface: I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . marketing: And is it going to include any of the  the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? user interface:  I think we include mute , but apart from that  I think we just we'll go for the simpleness . R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some project manager: Yeah , it's as optional functions . marketing: 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . industrial designer: Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ?  maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . industrial designer:  this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that  from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear , project manager: industrial designer:  it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off .  like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , project manager: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer: like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic .  so  I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , marketing: industrial designer: project manager:  for  our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept .  User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . So  I dunno , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . Andrew ? marketing:  yeah , just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of  sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . user interface:  just about the three buckets ,  what would go in the the device functions one ? industrial designer:  things like on off . Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but  you might wanna you know turn off the sound , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to  others or a device . project manager: Okay , so you're gonna have  audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi marketing: project manager: Okay ,  marketing: And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more industrial designer: Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . industrial designer:  even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . industrial designer: It's easy to use , I think that's one thing that  and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well project manager: Okay . project manager:  so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , industrial designer: project manager: because of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at <doc-sep>industrial designer: project manager: So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . And  so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . industrial designer: You can  choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . industrial designer: You have on the  on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . user interface: industrial designer: And here the the switch that control if you want project manager: Why you why you you put it in the the side ? industrial designer: Well I I I think  it's the project manager: It's not a good place maybe . industrial designer: Yeah but user interface: No i i it's the all around camer  microphone isn't it . marketing: Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? industrial designer: Well so it's a microphone array . industrial designer: No user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's just a single microphone , and you I I think  we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to user interface:  . industrial designer: well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . industrial designer: And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker  recognition system to  to be on or off . project manager: How much does it cost this one ? industrial designer: Well this this prototype is  made for about  well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars user interface: For the project manager: Fifteen dollars ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: fifteen dollars , project manager: Ah it's above it's above the budget . industrial designer: but  well it's not it's not  yeah , but  it's just a prototype and if we  if we optimises the  the  voila . project manager: How many b battery is there ? industrial designer: How many , excuse me ? project manager: Battery . industrial designer: Well  f battery , we use  about  user interface: Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . industrial designer: Yeah and you just project manager: So one one battery ? industrial designer: On  yeah one battery . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: You just n  marketing: Now what is the whole day rating for that ? industrial designer: The excuse me ? marketing: Whole day's rating . user interface: marketing: What type of battery ? industrial designer: Oh yeah it's just a r  simple battery a rechargeable  user interface: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Then the next time you pick it , oh project manager: industrial designer: it works . user interface: I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button industrial designer: Yeah just explain the button  Norman . This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , industrial designer: user interface: you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . industrial designer: user interface: You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . marketing: And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah it's project manager: industrial designer: So we have the the second version also with the different  button configuration . marketing: industrial designer: So basically th it's the same  marketing: -huh and also the switch . user interface: marketing: And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , user interface: Oh no marketing: because that's a major that's a user interface: th actually th we'll come to that point in our industrial designer: Yeah it's it's it's embed in the  speech recognition system . marketing: Okay industrial designer: So marketing: and if you disable speech recognition system then ? user interface: W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . user interface: Th they either these with the  the the charger any project manager: With the remote control . project manager: Okay so the price of the charger included in the user interface:  it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price  . user interface: It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but  again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but project manager: The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Yeah project manager: Well that's so user interface: but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . project manager: We have we have just marketing: Yeah people are willing to pay more , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . project manager: And the price of production user interface: industrial designer: Alright please  go on Norman with the special features . marketing: Or  user interface: Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , marketing: user interface: so is  modular . user interface: Yeah yeah , project manager: user interface: for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , marketing: Something like customised . industrial designer: user interface: You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . industrial designer: You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control project manager: But user interface:  yeah yeah you should present that . industrial designer: that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control marketing: And this is other one ? user interface: industrial designer: i i if you  if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and  which channel you want to choose and so on . industrial designer: H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , marketing:     . industrial designer: they just plug in it user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and they can have all the control they want here . industrial designer: We also have this module for  old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , user interface:  . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the  the same powerful functionalities . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our  an innovation   i in this  design here . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here oop industrial designer: user interface: it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? industrial designer: The titanium project manager: Titanium . industrial designer: and so it's very  user interface: Again  and the battery life is  is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . user interface: Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then  y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ ,  and then there's this message coming out that  please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it marketing: Okay . Yeah and  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define marketing:     . user interface: so sorry ? project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: And then  because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . project manager: What what's user interface: Maybe we can improve more on the design but project manager: Maybe yeah . industrial designer: project manager: What's the price to p to produce ? user interface:  this is the industrial designer: Well so the price to produce For  the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . project manager: With with with the charge ? industrial designer:  it's about it The without without the charger marketing: With the charger ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's about  well two dollars to produce  the microphone and speech recognition systems . user interface: industrial designer: Two dollars for the  for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you  sum up  everything wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . industrial designer: so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about  fifteen dollars . project manager: No it's industrial designer: But it's just if you want all functionalities . user interface: marketing: Yeah it's a nice input project manager: We marketing: but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . project manager: marketing: I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu user interface: Yeah . user interface: marketing: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and  in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and  very handy to hold . user interface: marketing: Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . industrial designer: Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen   with just four buttons . marketing: Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . marketing: And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . user interface: But the the problem is that  is it robust to mishandling ? industrial designer: Okay . user interface: We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . user interface: marketing: So these are the f  three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . marketing: say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , user interface:  . marketing: so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So user interface: So marketing: We can make our study on this and user interface: so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? marketing: No no we have you have designed two products now , project manager: Yeah . user interface: But who will give the scoring  we ourself or or a third party ? project manager: You . marketing: According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it  with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? user interface:  . marketing: D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? industrial designer: Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . marketing: And you both agree for that ? project manager: And you ? user interface: I think we can improve on the design . It's it it project manager: user interface:  we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . marketing: So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: Yeah a three . marketing: So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? user interface: Yeah . I think it's it's  more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated marketing: Four . industrial designer: so removing the L_C_D_  gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . industrial designer: Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six . marketing: Five with L_C_D_ and user interface: industrial designer: Well five also  Norman please . user interface: Yeah project manager:  user interface: from the innovation aspect I feel that  what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that  the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because  that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've  A lot of functionalities . user interface: So that is  that is  for both th marketing: So without L_C_D_ ? user interface: Our gi I think that the our our product is  has the best in all well this is a biased judgement industrial designer: user interface: because we designed them . marketing: No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: And without L_C_D_ ? industrial designer:  for both it's the the same innovations . So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:    there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? marketing: So we can't go project manager: industrial designer: Talk about user interface: We haven't really  determined what are actually actually project manager: marketing:  that what you are sayin that's what the design user interface: it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: marketing: No it's like this , project manager: marketing:  on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . Yeah but industrial designer: Yeah project manager: But industrial designer: but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . marketing: No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . industrial designer: If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n marketing: L_C_D_ ? Then  there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . marketing: Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a user interface: But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . marketing:  that depends upon your design , so user interface: Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , marketing:  user interface: we give what the customer  wants , right . user interface: marketing: So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? user interface: industrial designer: Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and  well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product user interface: industrial designer: so I will give a six for the easy to use . user interface: Yeah I think project manager: No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . project manager: Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , marketing: Yeah . project manager: and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be user interface: Yeah . marketing: Or we can just go back to the previous slide  where we ha we have a few updates . S industrial designer: And  if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to  for the shape and  things like that so marketing: Yeah that's right . For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , marketing: Yeah yeah that's right .  we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but  what I'm trying to say here is that the  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . marketing: So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? project manager: user interface: W  marketing: Or you want it to be six ? user interface: I think it's the same . industrial designer: Yes as you say , with better  project manager: Without L_C_D_ . marketing: S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . marketing: As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so let's go back to our laboratory and user interface: To improve on the design . project manager: what about the integration of speech recognition ? user interface: Huh ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . industrial designer: It's optional yeah , since well according to this study  people more likes more to have a spongy  remote control than project manager: I think it will be I think i user interface: marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these  marketing: Yeah , but  if you have an add-ons , the kids may just  hide the parental module project manager: Yeah . project manager: Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , industrial designer: project manager: so mayb better if you have all this in the same marketing: In the same set , yeah , project manager: marketing: and and individual buttons to make them work . user interface: The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . I don't know , project manager: So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  will be optional . user interface: what do you think  ? Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . project manager:  marketing:  how to how to how to make a marketing survey that  how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ user interface: Yeah . But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? project manager: I think it inc increase . industrial designer: Oh no , project manager: industrial designer: because if you if you add  something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces  to to to build but project manager:  . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah user interface: industrial designer: it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities  on the same module , but  user interface:  . marketing: On the same P_C_B_ user interface: Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . industrial designer: user interface: We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m project manager: marketing: Updates and we sell it . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And  what's the idea about  the shape of the remote controls ? industrial designer: Well so marketing:  can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah marketing: Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and industrial designer: I think we are yeah but we are also the  well the components will have to change because  we have to deal with the shape and  but I don't think it will  increase the cost too much so user interface:  . marketing: Or  it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior  shape is different o for all . industrial designer:  well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to  ah well user interface: Yeah . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin marketing: Yeah , yeah that's right . industrial designer: and then  add on skins and with with this  tex spongy texture  things like that . project manager: So industrial designer: So we finished the prototype  presentation if you have  something else to say . user interface: marketing: I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . We have to give answers so marketing: user interface: I suppose that you this criteria , is it ? project manager: Project evaluation . This room is a bit small , but industrial designer: project manager: user interface: but I think it's okay for us to work with . marketing: I feel it's fine , we know we don't need  I think it's okay . marketing:   what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? user interface:  we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . industrial designer: Yeah and also more well  more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have  clear clear points whenever we do a meeting marketing: user interface:  . industrial designer:  prior to the meeting to have  well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . marketing: And the evaluation was project manager: Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . marketing: So project manager: Yeah free free coffee user interface: Alright then , we finished ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Yeah thank you for your work and marketing: Yeah thank you , thank you very much "

        "Query": "What were the opinions of the User Interface and Industrial designers regarding the attractiveness and appearance of the product, as well as the price and ease of use, during the evaluation of the prototype and discussion of functional requirements?",
        "Summary": "The User Interface team believed that the product incorporated fashion elements to attract buyers, as some buttons were shaped like cherries and had a spongy texture. They also mentioned a banana-shaped wireless phone that sold for over a hundred Euros, making their product's price of just 25 Euros very attractive to customers. The product would offer basic functions, with the option for users to pay more for additional features such as an LCD and speech recognition with a microphone. To make the product look fancy and meet different customers' needs, the team suggested offering it in multiple colors instead of just one standard grey. During a discussion about creating a new product that was both fashionable and easy for elderly users to use, the User Interface team emphasized the importance of ensuring better usability and making the remote control visually appealing. The Marketing team also suggested considering different colors or shapes for the remote control.",
        "Article": "I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but marketing: Yeah , you have to you have to close that window . marketing: project manager: Yeah , but I've ta  marketing: project manager: right , I'll just re-do it . user interface: it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? And it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac . What's this this one ? user interface: Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . marketing: industrial designer: They're thinking user interface: But  , we didn't have anything small enough to write . industrial designer: For the first time , well it was hard to get the h  the actual labelling on the individual buttons . industrial designer: Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , user interface: marketing: Yeah . And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only  button that would be a different colour would be the  the red apple button . But  , yeah so  but there would be a cost implication on that , marketing: I'll see if I can find them . project manager: and  as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be  open to debate , I suppose . industrial designer: Yeah , sis user interface: Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important , marketing: Have user interface: but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . marketing: project manager: Right , okay so  And the second one underneath would be the idea for the industrial designer: Yes , we'll have the slide-away . So So , we've got prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria ,  and finance , so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various  aspects that we're looking for  from  our previous meeting . user interface: project manager: So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but  obviously obviously it would . We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , industrial designer: Yes , yes . project manager: and whether it would  marketing: So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ? industrial designer: This this is a user interface: that's it . marketing: That's the pr project manager: Right , so  as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first  considerations was to be in d under   twelve fifty or two and a half  twelve and a half Euros . So that should  Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that  industrial designer: Could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ? marketing: we should plug it in . marketing: Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one . So , sh marketing: We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . project manager: Okay , so , by the fact that we've got  the simple chip and the  kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . industrial designer:  project manager: Well , originally , I thought there would just be  one in there because it was the one red apple . But industrial designer:  project manager: So the so the real w the real question then would come in . Do you make all the buttons marketing: Well do we'll do it on the prototype , project manager: O marketing: so do two , see how much it is . project manager: We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , industrial designer: And then we'd have project manager: so , I was originally , I was thinking rubber wasn't special , marketing: project manager: So And the r  effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there . I think you just do one , don't you , for the project manager: W I don't know is is is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore  , what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore marketing: I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else project manager: Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . marketing: I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button . project manager:  Okay , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . project manager: And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . project manager: And if What happened ? marketing: You've just gone off the window into another one . user interface: Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . user interface: project manager: Okay , so , but the point would be that if we  if we just did special Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . industrial designer: So that's nine point one there so we've got some project manager: So it Well , is it s is no , it's nine point seven I've got . industrial designer: Just give us a bit of project manager: So , that would that would work out fine if   as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . project manager: And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had  planned to put on . user interface: S marketing: industrial designer: I switching around those th  on the electronics we got the sample sensor . industrial designer: I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech marketing: Yeah .  , if we Okay , that gives us twelve point seven industrial designer: So  maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition project manager: But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the industrial designer: without project manager: Oh , I see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? You know how you turn that one to a zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , marketing: Yeah , we have to have it industrial designer: Oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe . industrial designer: We should Yeah , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov project manager: But you reckon that i  the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . Well , since it's the through the whole technology type thing , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them .  , whether they would figure the the s  sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . industrial designer: or whatever they would prefer not  You know what  ? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the  losing the remote . project manager: But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two . The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to  make it originally , we're gonna make it a simple product . marketing: Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? project manager: So , we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on . Sorry , do you want that back up ? marketing: Yeah , I just had a presentation to do . user interface: But I do think  the v  voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . project manager: Okay , but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . Right okay  , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . user interface: marketing: And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end .  so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . So if we do a sort of a one So industrial designer: Okay , well we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . industrial designer: then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . marketing: Of but I think What Is one false , or is t one true ? user interface: One's true . user interface: Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . So , false is seven , true is one , and So  say about a two for fancy , industrial designer: Yeah . Well , it's just that  saying something remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got  various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options . marketing: Yeah , so that so sh should we go for a a two on that ? project manager: Okay . And  , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? industrial designer: deciding between the kinetic power or  the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , industrial designer:  marketing: we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . marketing: Alright , so project manager: Didn't you ? Or marketing: So it doesn't It's pretty The prototype as it is isn't sort of  fulfilling the industrial designer: No may is maybe about neutral user interface: Maybe a three . industrial designer: plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got marketing: Okay . project manager: The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: the other functions we've got in are are more at the The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at  just special colours  is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . project manager: And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your  sample sensor speaker , industrial designer:  project manager: and then you're looking to  take out  point two , marketing: S I'm just gonna check my email . user interface: How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would  enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could  fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . industrial designer: So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so project manager: Yeah . project manager: Ye marketing: I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . project manager: Well , okay , but user interface: Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . marketing: So ,  does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the  the speech project manager: We got we've we've got thirteen point seven user interface: Yeah . project manager: and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . project manager: But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too industrial designer: Yeah , yeah .  , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , m  user interface: Maybe two ? industrial designer: Yeah , it was just doing it quite well . industrial designer: I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's  project manager: Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable . project manager: The product is a recognisable real r  reaction product ? marketing: Yeah , this is industrial designer:  the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , marketing: This project manager: industrial designer: and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Does it fit in with our other other products , which  are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . project manager: S user interface: marketing: user interface: well it's got the same  speech feature as the coffee machine . marketing: What do y industrial designer: Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . So we're going for a two , marketing: So industrial designer: Maybe a kind of three ?  d project manager: three ? user interface: Yeah , two or three . marketing: Two or three ? user interface: Well , the logo would be more  recognisable on the actual thing . project manager: So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then marketing: Yeah . user interface: What does what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate or anything ? marketing: Yeah we s yeah , I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head . industrial designer: Yeah , so it's marketing: So So it's  it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . industrial designer: So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . marketing: Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances project manager: Okay , well I put it back on . industrial designer: So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ? project manager: marketing: I'm not sure . project manager: Okay , so what was it , control  F_ eight , wasn't it ? user interface: Ah it's on . So , you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . industrial designer: Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , project manager: That's right . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case . project manager: Okay , so industrial designer: And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of project manager: So we're going for plastic , yes ? marketing: Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Oh yeah , and that would now be marketing: And then industrial designer: Yeah , that's that's within the budget .  Do we actually have Do we just have one special  special forms down here ? project manager: Well ,  w  there was debate as to how you would count them . industrial designer:  project manager: Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour . industrial designer: And we we've we've got we've got enough for another user interface: Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons . industrial designer: so we've got enough for another project manager: Well , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special industrial designer: Yeah ,  project manager: So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . industrial designer: But the but but but the project manager: The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium . industrial designer: I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . industrial designer: Yeah , which I think we should Yeah , they'll still be fine for the for the price . marketing: Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas  of rubber , isn't it . project manager: The rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? Was that the idea ? industrial designer: Ne  user interface: Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit . user interface: marketing: Okay , so tha industrial designer: So I think that should still be okay . industrial designer: So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , project manager: Yep . industrial designer: but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the project manager: I woulda said so . marketing: So shall we do a Well ,  industrial designer: And specially it definitely could fits the the real product What was the what's the company name ? project manager: Real Reaction produ user interface: Real Reactions ? industrial designer: R yeah . user interface: industrial designer:  it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of  inno innovative c type company , then  having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on marketing: Yeah , so  project manager: Yep I would s marketing: So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so project manager: You mean of industrial designer:  marketing: And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , project manager: Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , industrial designer: So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . project manager: Yeah , we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? marketing: Is it industrial designer: That yeah , that was  marketing: The rubber . industrial designer: I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest . industrial designer:  So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ? marketing: But  industrial designer: I dunno . marketing: So  , we've got we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . industrial designer: And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so project manager: Well , ease has certainly stayed . And what about the sort of innovation ? industrial designer: well we've still got the kinetic energy . We've maybe lost Hasn't it It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect project manager: How it would play out , yeah . Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know .  industrial designer: But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: But either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what marketing: Yeah . Okay , well  user interface: Yeah , I don't see how we could make it any more .  , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing . user interface: But then what colour would you make the R_s ? industrial designer: just the the company logo . project manager: Well , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . marketing: Hey , what what what's the company colour ? Did you get told what the company colour is or industrial designer: I'm still not quite sure we've established that . user interface: I just project manager: But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with  the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . user interface: project manager: There's virtually n The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , marketing:  . project manager: so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . So basically , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the  on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . 'Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . marketing: Or would that be t project manager: Well , we decided that the blue ones were the  the standard colour . project manager: So you were talking about   We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . industrial designer:  marketing: Shall we save the point two for profitability then ? project manager: Well , yeah . Bu but but  was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the  on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that  you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ? user interface: I don't think they would really need to be . industrial designer: Yeah , maybe we've m user interface: Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well . industrial designer: Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and  , fit the kind of idea of what they want . industrial designer: And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start .  it's the sort of thing that , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . project manager: Yeah , well marketing: So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . user interface: Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . project manager: marketing: Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit  shape on one of the buttons . marketing: le lemon sh user interface: Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? On the volume ones ? marketing: I think well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: Did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? Or was it the other way around ? industrial designer: You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . project manager: So what bit are we on to ? user interface: can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? And did we make it a cherry officially ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: project manager: marketing: project manager: Oh drats , I've botched that , haven't I . user interface: So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ? marketing: Well , we're aiming for  one for all of them . marketing: M but it really has to fit into the budget , so I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the Which is fair enough . Yeah , I think industrial designer: As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything . What's on the agenda ? project manager: Right , okay  What's happened here ? Right , okay   . So we got So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign . Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . So , we're actually now  , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . project manager: I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do . Well , we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings , project manager: In you on your own . marketing: and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , project manager:  marketing: and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . You know , you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that . project manager: The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . So industrial designer: Yeah , I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time marketing: Yeah . project manager: Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , industrial designer: and then diff things will be relevant . project manager: Anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? user interface: marketing: project manager: I've put , seemed okay . industrial designer: Is this go It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on . project manager: You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so marketing: But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . From the website it looks it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we user interface: marketing: that's , you know , fifteen quid . Like  , companies can have like a range of products and project manager: I th I  d industrial designer: I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of project manager: But the other thing is that  they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this  software to to demonstrate how you could  do a project . project manager:  for  you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . project manager: So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can  ask whatever question . And then you or the idea is that the whichever  person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or  or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever . So  , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the  computer software to enable  to enable it to work .  if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction ,  it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . So project manager: Does industrial designer: voice recognition , especially not could project manager: You've got voice recognition computers , marketing:  yeah . Okay , industrial designer: Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . marketing: I don't think sort of the budget  allowed us to do anything project manager: Bit bit arbitrary . marketing: Well ,  I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products .  , they've got all these sort of , you know , high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d  lightweight computer screens , project manager: marketing: and  I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . project manager: So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . user interface: marketing: Surely they they should produ project manager: And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing . user interface: But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager . project manager: Now , I'd much rather be in marketing user interface: marketing: project manager: but I certainly didn't get this  computer to work as well as I would have liked . marketing: project manager: However ,  Alright  means , so whiteboard  so really , it's  equipment . marketing: Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but user interface: But  , I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these .  , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? Where do you get the recording ? Do you plug the computer or something ? marketing: I think there's a little there's a little  chi industrial designer: So it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so marketing: There's a little there's a little chip , I think you must plug it into something industrial designer: Should we quickly look at the last slide ? marketing: and it produces a industrial designer: Sh user interface: Right . Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , and Page after page . project manager:  and  voice marketing: project manager: was it voice activated  marketing: Voice recognition , yeah . marketing: To fill in these fill in these questionnaires project manager: Right , so ,  are the costs within budget , marketing: Oh no . Is that everything ? marketing:  ? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .  , so we don't re So really I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere <doc-sep>So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and  industrial designer: Industrial Design . project manager: And after that we  will have the  new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . project manager: No , industrial designer: Three three , it's three project manager: I'm participant one . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our  remote T_V_ control . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . So how can we  design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?  , let's move to next slide . As we know  Google it's a very successful because his  powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . project manager: user interface: So my job is to  design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So industrial designer: user interface: That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation . user interface:  With sophisticated functions , project manager: So powerful , user interface: but with very yeah powerful . marketing: So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , industrial designer: To merge the two system huh . marketing: industrial designer: But But this is user interface: But if we have very very good user interface marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . project manager: Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . industrial designer: So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that So . project manager: Go on , go back and industrial designer: Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright . marketing: industrial designer: It you project manager: So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . marketing: industrial designer: The rationale must be design , or project manager: So , Baba is the  the Industrial Designer . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know  to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the project manager: industrial designer: how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . industrial designer: but I propose a nifra infrared base you know , so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ project manager: marketing: industrial designer: so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to marketing: True . project manager: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? industrial designer: I think it's cheaper than laser , so . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen , marketing: What the cost is ? project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have   Let's see . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here project manager: You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . project manager: What is this ? industrial designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . industrial designer: So and the next slide , it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless . industrial designer: Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ? marketing: What's the average price of this technology then ? industrial designer: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the user interface: So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire with remote control ? industrial designer: You'd yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . project manager: So you think that  a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea . project manager: No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu marketing: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , user interface: Wireless remote control . project manager: but marketing: I don't think well , yeah , I don't think he would , industrial designer: Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know , project manager: marketing: but in a sense industrial designer: sometime I want to have wire because you know . project manager: Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have  linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? industrial designer: project manager: I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ? industrial designer: I don't think it will be too much . industrial designer: Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know project manager: Okay . industrial designer: I think wha wha with the wire it's  cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . marketing: Now the project manager: So industrial designer: Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . project manager: I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , marketing: Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else  . We had one hundred subjects , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , and see what was okay or not for them .  actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls  ugly , okay , so that's project manager: You mean the loo the look , the outside ? industrial designer: The look , how it look like . So this is where we could have  yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more . And then  yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . And  users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . project manager: marketing: So this is from the experiments we've done , project manager: marketing: so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .  it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And  remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . project manager: What is R_S_I_ ? marketing: R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same  doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . marketing: Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . marketing: And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of  functions , but less buttons , user interface: Functions . And just to have  an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? user interface: But I'm not sure project manager: Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . project manager: I think the marketing: It's user interface: No you you can have a switch menu , so you can project manager: Yeah , but it has to be intuitive . Then for  you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . Okay , user interface: Then you you put the switch button , project manager: but user interface: then it switch to another category of functions . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your  recorder . industrial designer: With a user interface: So there's a different functions , but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . project manager: Yeah , but user interface: But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . marketing: industrial designer: This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people . user interface: marketing: Yeah , this is something we sh user interface: Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and  uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so . industrial designer: I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard project manager: Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . user interface: Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: And also f user interface: Maybe we can have di di we can have  several options , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , marketing: Yeah , user interface: project manager: and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as  previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as  it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . project manager: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ . project manager: So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ? marketing: Yeah , it's done , just yeah . If we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it . project manager: So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that  for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's user interface: project manager: It's is  marketing: Lame , or project manager: No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext . project manager: So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , industrial designer: Yep . project manager: and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not you won't be  you won't had  buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . project manager: It's marketing: - project manager: because if we want to to do remote control user interface:  . project manager: which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . project manager: So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . project manager: And also we want the image of the   real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . project manager:  that's  if  you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . project manager: So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the   user interface: Okay . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so . project manager: industrial designer: This is marketing: I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . project manager: but mayb industrial designer: Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . user interface: A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ . industrial designer: It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . industrial designer: the global usage , user interface: Global , industrial designer: so if people don't have the technology . project manager: So everybody is okay with the new requirements ? user interface: So I I so As as for the colour , what what do you think ? project manager: I think it has to be yellow . user interface: Yellow ? T_V_ remote control ? marketing: Min project manager: Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised . industrial designer: I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Doesn't need to be completely yellow , project manager: So you have to user interface: Okay . It's okay ? marketing: Regarding the first line , what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .  Y you You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put  pon marketing: Industrial Designer . project manager: And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder <doc-sep>Then  I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you  a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by  our two colleagues that make good work . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And  then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . And  end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . project manager: d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say  to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped  case with  a rubber material around it industrial designer: project manager: to be  to feel spongy , user interface: Like a banana . project manager: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can  we can continue with this product  as if , marketing: project manager: and we are now going to see the project evaluation with  our marketing expert . marketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about  during the previous  meetings . marketing: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and  according to what you think about the this project you can   make a one point , two point or seven point . marketing: The okay ?  so  fancy look and feel , what do you think ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Do you vote  Christine ? marketing: eh ? user interface: Do you also vote ? marketing: No , I just want to see something project manager: Maybe we all have to agree on a common user interface: Well , we can very easily . So user interface: marketing: Need to project manager: this is your marketing:  I don't know if you we ha we have to put  one  f If it's better or project manager: One is most . project manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? marketing: Six  s you can how much what ? project manager: How much would you you don't answer to this  questionnaire ? marketing: Oh yes I  I dunno  , I think six , it's a good  user interface: So it will have five point five average . project manager: Four ? industrial designer: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . I I user interface: D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? project manager: No . project manager: Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? marketing: We can put four ? user interface: Yeah . Is it fashion ? project manager: Oh yeah , user interface: project manager: its its f its fruit fruit shape . marketing: Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , user interface: Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . marketing: We have the lightning , or project manager: Yeah , we have the marketing: The lighting . project manager: we don't sesh especially have the lightning user interface: So you'll make the material transparent project manager: but marketing: user interface: so that it  lights up completely , or project manager: So it's yellow . project manager: I think it's very easy to marketing: Seven ? project manager: I would say seven . marketing: Is it is it robust ? project manager: Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , industrial designer:  f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . user interface: Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , project manager: Yeah . user interface: I don't know project manager: But it is  it is surrounded by rubber material .  if we say that seven it's  it's the better , project manager: Yeah , the be . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , the top marketing: and when  s six sit six are good it's a good  p product , I think . user interface: Because I saw  some phones that were banana shaped ,  wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , marketing: project manager: Yeah . user interface:  quite big also , marketing: user interface: and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . project manager: I think the industrial designer: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . user interface: it's much more complex , but project manager: So , I think , we can summarise . We we have the cost below  our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . marketing: project manager: So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now  open champagne and make a huge party . user interface: project manager: I don't know if it's provided by  by the meeting staff . user interface: So what does the management say ? project manager: Sorry ? user interface: What does the management say ? project manager: I think we will have  much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well <doc-sep>project manager: I just forgot their name , so  you're i sorry , I just forgot them all . project manager: W_I_E_S_ z Z_ or S_ ? user interface: A_ E_ Z_ zee zee project manager:   zee . industrial designer: I was a little short on time , project manager: Yeah , me too , so that's not industrial designer: but user interface: Yeah , same here . Which one was mine ? project manager: So let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough . So we have Oh no , what's that ? So so we have  forty minutes for this  for this second meeting , and we have to make  sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are , user interface: Good . project manager: that we know what we're going to make  th what the product is going to like look like . How do I escape this ? How do I I escape this s  presentation ? industrial designer: What ? user interface:  left . Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the  Should be a univ  universal remote control No , that's I  s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . project manager:  so yeah , it still has to be  f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . project manager:  so So yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for  user interface: Which one first ? marketing: Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . project manager: I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me , marketing: You didn't read it ? project manager: I didn't get it  anyway . project manager: The last point is quite an interesting marketing: Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . marketing: And  maybe our  fold open system is is a good one , but I don't think it's  project manager: Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top , marketing: reachable . project manager: then you're you're marketing: Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . That's exactly what we said about  maybe a home station for  for it  to  recharge the batteries or something .  I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you clap your hands it will beep or something . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c  this is so difficult ,  a difficulty I think . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't We we haven't  we mustn't look too much at  the last point .   they finally had a conclusion that younger people   under an age of f forty five are  more interested in new features . But  they  they don't want to  have a lot of  new features , because they're in their old  thinking way . marketing: But y But you but you already said that the  company was about  forty plus  clients ? project manager: People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , marketing: I I think we can speak ,  we can skip speech recognition  directly , user interface: Yeah . Okay , that's not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ .  my point is , well , I If we ma  make a a remote  control for only television , I think it's hard to  sell it for twenty five Euros . marketing: Yeah , only only for television  On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi  we m must made it make it  very special . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can  make it a special product . marketing: to k to keep it simple when you user interface: But  we also have to stand out , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . project manager: It's on the on the  net net  thing , user interface: There it is . project manager: So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or user interface: Yeah , I have it on the next page .  so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons .  a way to find out  what people use is maybe just to use  questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control project manager: Yeah . And I found an  Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same  pages on text and always have to click the number . user interface: But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your industrial designer: Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . Or not ? project manager: Maybe i maybe it's too complicated , user interface: No y project manager: but not sure . user interface: Well project manager: It's a good idea , but user interface: it's It was just a thought . So I'm , I u I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . But  how can you remember what  channel  connects to what favourite button ? user interface: Well  project manager:  user interface: what I was reading on the page . user interface: Well if you said a favourite industrial designer: Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and project manager:  mayb for me it's user interface: Well i project manager: If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never . project manager: So user interface: Oh are you ? project manager: And user interface: Okay now , m maybe not . project manager: If I don't do it , maybe old people user interface: No , maybe elderly people  . I dunno if that's usable project manager: It's not , it's still not It's not anymore n  user interface: when Not anymore for T_V_ . I dunno , miss Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ . Previous I know , but next channel ? user interface: Just the channel   What  is  industrial designer: I don't thi marketing: Forward . industrial designer: But   there's also a button to  go to the channel you've been before . project manager:  Yeah , user interface: I don't have  I did project manager: I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people . project manager: And how do you want to  do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Normally you can press one , zero or user interface: Yeah , I think  f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that  project manager: A ten plus or user interface: Yeah , the ten plus button . industrial designer: Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to  Because you h have to be fast enough . marketing: Yeah , it's it's no it's not a user interface: So you have  like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must  type one or two . user interface: So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two  stripes . user interface: So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that And not for elderly people to look , one two  press and aim and industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f marketing: It's only for television now . user interface: so you have industrial designer: I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like   m maybe  switch channels and  volume and k that kind of things , and  the menu button . user interface: Yeah , okay , industrial designer: So user interface: but  project manager: Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to user interface: Yeah , a mute button . user interface: Yeah well , marketing: user interface: that's that's I think that's the layers that produce . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . It looks very cheap if you make it user interface: Well , maybe you can look at  mobile phones . marketing: user interface: Who ? project manager: Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .  basically what happens is you press a button ,  then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button ,  like a switch . So that's er  do two different things project manager: So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ? industrial designer: but Yeah . user interface:  j Is industrial designer: I I'm not sure if it's the same thing . user interface: Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? marketing: Yeah , that's active . project manager: Or just a green one , user interface: So project manager: because it's If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green . project manager: But if you industrial designer: So marketing: I it's it's just  the the project manager: Red's l shows up like something's wrong , industrial designer: Two ? project manager: and green is like it's okay , you press the button . user interface: Maybe depends on  industrial designer: Ma on on most on most   remote controls it's red . industrial designer: I I think  the batteries will be  a little user interface:  Oh , marketing: Empty . Just  project manager: No , we have a recharger in it , so user interface: Oh . It's it's not very important , project manager: Green or red or whatever , it is cool . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can  o On the Otherwise it won't work . user interface: So we have to  make buttons for that as well , to make it  industrial designer: No . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to user interface: Okay . user interface: Well , I I use a universal  remote control , marketing:  I kno user interface: and list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: And the modern one you you  you type  search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . industrial designer: So it  We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . project manager: I just say Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking There's just a short industrial designer:  okay . industrial designer: And  by d  that can be done by  just  cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . industrial designer: And  What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip ,  is trying to switch off the television . And when it's  switched off , you can push a button as  it's working now , so And then he saves that setting project manager: Okay . marketing: industrial designer: Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't I w I was a little short on time . To flash up your industrial designer: Yeah marketing:  if you if you use the buttons ,  both of them works . Because  when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can Basically if the battery is low , it won't work . project manager: Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're  sending a signal . project manager: And it's you also know which button you p marketing: But then have to be on the in the all  remote control have to be LEDs . But it marketing: Everywhere in the r project manager: But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED . user interface: No I don't think so , but Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else . user interface: 'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our  motto also is marketing: Is LEDs  beneath the the buttons ? user interface: Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even . industrial designer: Yeah , but  like when you push it user interface: Yeah , then then won't Then you won't see it . Or or m maybe on top of the A green light is flashing marketing: Yeah , then industrial designer: or marketing: Yeah . marketing: Maybe  project manager: The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ? user interface: Yeah , we're thinking about it . project manager: If you push user interface:  on a mobile phone , in the dark  project manager: It lights up . user interface: Yeah , if  a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's marketing: Okay . user interface: Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote . But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use marketing: Yeah , project manager: Yeah , that's a good idea , okay . We'll have enough power project manager: Everything agre industrial designer: to project manager: Everyone agrees with that , or Okay . marketing: Maybe what Paul said ,  under the on the on the home station ,  a button to  to call your  remote control , that it beeps . Because it's i it has to be marketing: twenty five Euros , I think we can make it . Are you almost finished or just industrial designer: Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out . I don't think so , industrial designer: No , project manager: but industrial designer: and I I think a lot of people use  teletext , still use . project manager: Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . user interface: That's important I think and marketing: L_C_D_ doesn't work for  twelve and a half Euros I think . user interface: And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it . user interface: So industrial designer:  ah I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you marketing: Oh , I'm watching  the channel one . No , it's not user interface: Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . And  then the usability is not that required , because the Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . Is that reachable maybe ? industrial designer: I didn't read marketing: That's very That's fancy . But marketing: If it's possible , industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: I don't think it's very expensive actually . project manager: Why should it ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's marketing:  if i if i project manager: You only have a microphone in it . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or project manager: Nah , maybe marketing: Ah that's a problem , but industrial designer: And and  w Yeah ? marketing:  only in English .  does your  Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever industrial designer: Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but user interface:  one to have in channel one ? marketing: No , that Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do do we do it ? user interface: Yeah , marketing: It's more if we if we do it . user interface: Is project manager: It We have short time to to put it on the market , industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno . marketing: Yeah , and  and  user interface: It's marketing: In  indeed  the languages are a difficult thing . I don't think it's  useful enough to take the effort to design something with  speech recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech  speech recognition , you can just throw the  marketing: Yeah . user interface: but marketing: Okay , but th that becomes your f   because that's very hard for  speech recognition . project manager: you can see on the  So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make  a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do user interface: Yeah , I think so . project manager: If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ? industrial designer: Yeah , that's good . So  It lights up when it's dark ? project manager: Yeah , but it's Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . user interface: I didn't project manager: If you push something , it it all lights up . Yeah yeah , user interface: Yeah , but  marketing: it it mustn't work all the time . marketing: So if you user interface: Or maybe when you marketing: No , if you use one button , it must turn  on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . project manager: And do we use a a  what's it called ? Like a iMac , if you can look through it . project manager: so y you just make it th through You look through it ? marketing: A see-through . We put in the the simple buttons on the top , user interface: It's the standard project manager: and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . project manager: Yeah , maybe you have you have to  when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . With just  standard buttons we just have so little project manager: O but maybe you can put  the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . user interface: No , I don't need don't need  teletext options are only four buttons or something . industrial designer: Yeah , but younger people I think  more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext .  marketing: user interface: How long is lunch break ? project manager: So yeah , you know what you have to do <doc-sep>industrial designer: project manager: So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . And  so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . industrial designer: You can  choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . industrial designer: You have on the  on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . user interface: industrial designer: And here the the switch that control if you want project manager: Why you why you you put it in the the side ? industrial designer: Well I I I think  it's the project manager: It's not a good place maybe . industrial designer: Yeah but user interface: No i i it's the all around camer  microphone isn't it . marketing: Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? industrial designer: Well so it's a microphone array . industrial designer: No user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's just a single microphone , and you I I think  we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to user interface:  . industrial designer: well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . industrial designer: And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker  recognition system to  to be on or off . project manager: How much does it cost this one ? industrial designer: Well this this prototype is  made for about  well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars user interface: For the project manager: Fifteen dollars ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: fifteen dollars , project manager: Ah it's above it's above the budget . industrial designer: but  well it's not it's not  yeah , but  it's just a prototype and if we  if we optimises the  the  voila . project manager: How many b battery is there ? industrial designer: How many , excuse me ? project manager: Battery . industrial designer: Well  f battery , we use  about  user interface: Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . industrial designer: Yeah and you just project manager: So one one battery ? industrial designer: On  yeah one battery . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: You just n  marketing: Now what is the whole day rating for that ? industrial designer: The excuse me ? marketing: Whole day's rating . user interface: marketing: What type of battery ? industrial designer: Oh yeah it's just a r  simple battery a rechargeable  user interface: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Then the next time you pick it , oh project manager: industrial designer: it works . user interface: I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button industrial designer: Yeah just explain the button  Norman . This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , industrial designer: user interface: you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . industrial designer: user interface: You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . marketing: And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah it's project manager: industrial designer: So we have the the second version also with the different  button configuration . marketing: industrial designer: So basically th it's the same  marketing: -huh and also the switch . user interface: marketing: And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , user interface: Oh no marketing: because that's a major that's a user interface: th actually th we'll come to that point in our industrial designer: Yeah it's it's it's embed in the  speech recognition system . marketing: Okay industrial designer: So marketing: and if you disable speech recognition system then ? user interface: W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . user interface: Th they either these with the  the the charger any project manager: With the remote control . project manager: Okay so the price of the charger included in the user interface:  it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price  . user interface: It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but  again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but project manager: The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Yeah project manager: Well that's so user interface: but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . project manager: We have we have just marketing: Yeah people are willing to pay more , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . project manager: And the price of production user interface: industrial designer: Alright please  go on Norman with the special features . marketing: Or  user interface: Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , marketing: user interface: so is  modular . user interface: Yeah yeah , project manager: user interface: for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , marketing: Something like customised . industrial designer: user interface: You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . industrial designer: You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control project manager: But user interface:  yeah yeah you should present that . industrial designer: that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control marketing: And this is other one ? user interface: industrial designer: i i if you  if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and  which channel you want to choose and so on . industrial designer: H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , marketing:     . industrial designer: they just plug in it user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and they can have all the control they want here . industrial designer: We also have this module for  old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , user interface:  . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the  the same powerful functionalities . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our  an innovation   i in this  design here . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here oop industrial designer: user interface: it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? industrial designer: The titanium project manager: Titanium . industrial designer: and so it's very  user interface: Again  and the battery life is  is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . user interface: Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then  y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ ,  and then there's this message coming out that  please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it marketing: Okay . Yeah and  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define marketing:     . user interface: so sorry ? project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: And then  because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . project manager: What what's user interface: Maybe we can improve more on the design but project manager: Maybe yeah . industrial designer: project manager: What's the price to p to produce ? user interface:  this is the industrial designer: Well so the price to produce For  the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . project manager: With with with the charge ? industrial designer:  it's about it The without without the charger marketing: With the charger ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's about  well two dollars to produce  the microphone and speech recognition systems . user interface: industrial designer: Two dollars for the  for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you  sum up  everything wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . industrial designer: so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about  fifteen dollars . project manager: No it's industrial designer: But it's just if you want all functionalities . user interface: marketing: Yeah it's a nice input project manager: We marketing: but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . project manager: marketing: I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu user interface: Yeah . user interface: marketing: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and  in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and  very handy to hold . user interface: marketing: Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . industrial designer: Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen   with just four buttons . marketing: Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . marketing: And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . user interface: But the the problem is that  is it robust to mishandling ? industrial designer: Okay . user interface: We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . user interface: marketing: So these are the f  three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . marketing: say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , user interface:  . marketing: so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So user interface: So marketing: We can make our study on this and user interface: so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? marketing: No no we have you have designed two products now , project manager: Yeah . user interface: But who will give the scoring  we ourself or or a third party ? project manager: You . marketing: According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it  with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? user interface:  . marketing: D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? industrial designer: Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . marketing: And you both agree for that ? project manager: And you ? user interface: I think we can improve on the design . It's it it project manager: user interface:  we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . marketing: So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: Yeah a three . marketing: So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? user interface: Yeah . I think it's it's  more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated marketing: Four . industrial designer: so removing the L_C_D_  gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . industrial designer: Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six . marketing: Five with L_C_D_ and user interface: industrial designer: Well five also  Norman please . user interface: Yeah project manager:  user interface: from the innovation aspect I feel that  what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that  the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because  that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've  A lot of functionalities . user interface: So that is  that is  for both th marketing: So without L_C_D_ ? user interface: Our gi I think that the our our product is  has the best in all well this is a biased judgement industrial designer: user interface: because we designed them . marketing: No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: And without L_C_D_ ? industrial designer:  for both it's the the same innovations . So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:    there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? marketing: So we can't go project manager: industrial designer: Talk about user interface: We haven't really  determined what are actually actually project manager: marketing:  that what you are sayin that's what the design user interface: it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: marketing: No it's like this , project manager: marketing:  on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . Yeah but industrial designer: Yeah project manager: But industrial designer: but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . marketing: No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . industrial designer: If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n marketing: L_C_D_ ? Then  there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . marketing: Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a user interface: But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . marketing:  that depends upon your design , so user interface: Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , marketing:  user interface: we give what the customer  wants , right . user interface: marketing: So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? user interface: industrial designer: Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and  well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product user interface: industrial designer: so I will give a six for the easy to use . user interface: Yeah I think project manager: No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . project manager: Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , marketing: Yeah . project manager: and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be user interface: Yeah . marketing: Or we can just go back to the previous slide  where we ha we have a few updates . S industrial designer: And  if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to  for the shape and  things like that so marketing: Yeah that's right . For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , marketing: Yeah yeah that's right .  we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but  what I'm trying to say here is that the  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . marketing: So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? project manager: user interface: W  marketing: Or you want it to be six ? user interface: I think it's the same . industrial designer: Yes as you say , with better  project manager: Without L_C_D_ . marketing: S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . marketing: As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so let's go back to our laboratory and user interface: To improve on the design . project manager: what about the integration of speech recognition ? user interface: Huh ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . industrial designer: It's optional yeah , since well according to this study  people more likes more to have a spongy  remote control than project manager: I think it will be I think i user interface: marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these  marketing: Yeah , but  if you have an add-ons , the kids may just  hide the parental module project manager: Yeah . project manager: Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , industrial designer: project manager: so mayb better if you have all this in the same marketing: In the same set , yeah , project manager: marketing: and and individual buttons to make them work . user interface: The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . I don't know , project manager: So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  will be optional . user interface: what do you think  ? Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . project manager:  marketing:  how to how to how to make a marketing survey that  how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ user interface: Yeah . But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? project manager: I think it inc increase . industrial designer: Oh no , project manager: industrial designer: because if you if you add  something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces  to to to build but project manager:  . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah user interface: industrial designer: it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities  on the same module , but  user interface:  . marketing: On the same P_C_B_ user interface: Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . industrial designer: user interface: We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m project manager: marketing: Updates and we sell it . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And  what's the idea about  the shape of the remote controls ? industrial designer: Well so marketing:  can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah marketing: Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and industrial designer: I think we are yeah but we are also the  well the components will have to change because  we have to deal with the shape and  but I don't think it will  increase the cost too much so user interface:  . marketing: Or  it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior  shape is different o for all . industrial designer:  well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to  ah well user interface: Yeah . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin marketing: Yeah , yeah that's right . industrial designer: and then  add on skins and with with this  tex spongy texture  things like that . project manager: So industrial designer: So we finished the prototype  presentation if you have  something else to say . user interface: marketing: I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . We have to give answers so marketing: user interface: I suppose that you this criteria , is it ? project manager: Project evaluation . This room is a bit small , but industrial designer: project manager: user interface: but I think it's okay for us to work with . marketing: I feel it's fine , we know we don't need  I think it's okay . marketing:   what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? user interface:  we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . industrial designer: Yeah and also more well  more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have  clear clear points whenever we do a meeting marketing: user interface:  . industrial designer:  prior to the meeting to have  well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . marketing: And the evaluation was project manager: Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . marketing: So project manager: Yeah free free coffee user interface: Alright then , we finished ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Yeah thank you for your work and marketing: Yeah thank you , thank you very much "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the disadvantages of ATLAS and other options and the opinions of C and F regarding these disadvantages.",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the use of different frameworks for the external file representation. While the team was familiar with Perl and preferred a flat file format due to its simplicity, the idea of using ATLAS was suggested. It was proposed to initially use ATLAS and evaluate its suitability before fully adopting it. The team also considered P files, but the concern was that they could become large. One team member, C, emphasized the importance of considering the learning curve of other options and believed that a flat file format works well for everyone. C suggested that Perl could be combined with external representations of ATLAS files to create a functional system. Additionally, C mentioned that exploring alternatives to P files could be interesting, despite the potential learning curve. Another team member, F, focused on dealing with prosodic features at the level of small linguistic units. F proposed attaching these features to words or segments, with the option of extracting smaller units. This approach would allow the team to build on their existing work without starting from scratch.",
        "Article": "grad c: Yeah , we had a long discussion about how much w how easy we want to make it for people to bleep things out . phd d: It it doesn't grad c: Did did did it ? I didn't even check yesterday whether it was moving . phd d: So I don't know if it doesn't like both of us grad c: Channel three ? Channel three ? phd d: You know , I discovered something yesterday on these , wireless ones . grad c:  -  ? phd d: You can tell if it 's picking up breath noise and stuff . So if you yeah , if you breathe under breathe and then you see AF go off , then you know it 's p picking up your mouth noise . phd f: In fact , if you listen to just the channels of people not talking , it 's like \" @ @ \" . It 's very disgust grad c: What ? Did you see Hannibal recently or something ? phd f: Sorry . So , grad c:  phd f: I was gonna try to get out of here , like , in half an hour , cuz I really appreciate people coming , and the main thing that I was gonna ask people to help with today is to give input on what kinds of database format we should use in starting to link up things like word transcripts and annotations of word transcripts , so anything that transcribers or discourse coders or whatever put in the signal , with time - marks for , like , words and phone boundaries and all the stuff we get out of the forced alignments and the recognizer . So , we have this ,  I think a starting point is clearly the the channelized output of Dave Gelbart 's program , which Don brought a copy of , grad c: Yeah . phd f: which phd d: Can I see it ? grad c: And so the only question is it the sort of thing that you want to use or not ? Have you looked at that ?  , I had a web page up . So , grad c: So phd f: I actually mostly need to be able to link up , or I it 's it 's a question both of what the representation is and grad c: You mean , this I guess I am gonna be standing up and drawing on the board . grad c: and then you can have lots of different sections , each of which have I Ds attached to it , and then you can refer from other sections to those I Ds , if you want to . I don't e I don't remember exactly what my notation was , phd a: Oh , I remember seeing an example of this . grad c: Yeah , \" T equals one point three two \" ,  And then I I also had optional things like accuracy , and then \" ID equals T one , one seven \" . And then , I also wanted to to be i to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp . grad c: Yeah , so these are arbitrary , assigned by a program , not not by a user . And then somewhere la further down you might have something like an utterance tag which has \" start equals T - seventeen , end equals T - eighteen \" . grad c: Right ? But it ends at this T - eighteen , which may be somewhere else . We don't know what the t time actually is but we know that it 's the same time as this end time . Right ? So you could you could have some sort of other other tag later in the file that would be something like , oh , I don't know , \" noise - type equals door - slam \" . You know ? And then , you could either say \" time equals a particular time - mark \" or you could do other sorts of references . So or or you might have a prosody \" Prosody \" right ? D ? T ? D ? T ? T ? phd f: It 's an O instead of an I , but the D is good . grad c: you know , so you could have some sort of type here , and then you could have ,  the utterance that it 's referring to could be U - seventeen or something like that . So , that seems that seems g great for all of the encoding of things with time and , grad c: Oh , well . phd f:  I I guess my question is more , what d what do you do with , say , a forced alignment ? phd a: How - how phd f:  you 've got all these phone labels , and what do you do if you just conceptually , if you get , transcriptions where the words are staying but the time boundaries are changing , cuz you 've got a new recognition output , or s sort of what 's the , sequence of going from the waveforms that stay the same , the transcripts that may or may not change , and then the utterance which where the time boundaries that may or may not change ? phd a: Oh , that 's That 's actually very nicely handled here because you could you could all you 'd have to change is the , time - stamps in the time - line without without , changing the I Ds . And you 'd be able to propagate all of the the information ? grad c: Right . phd a: You 'd have you 'd have phd f: The we we have phone - level backtraces . grad c: Yeah , this I don't think I would do this for phone - level . I think for phone - level you want to use some sort of binary representation phd f:  grad c: because it 'll be too dense otherwise . So , if you were doing that and you had this sort of companion , thing that gets called up for phone - level , what would that look like ? phd a: Why grad c: I would use just an existing an existing way of doing it . But but why not use it for phone - level ? phd f: H h phd a: It 's just a matter of it 's just a matter of it being bigger . But if you have you know , barring memory limitations , or  I w  this is still the m grad c: It 's parsing limitations . I don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for . You would use it only for purposes where you actually want the phone - level information , I 'd imagine . phd f: So you could have some file that configures how much information you want in your in your XML or something .  , you 'd y phd f: phd a: You grad c: I I am imagining you 'd have multiple versions of this depending on the information that you want . grad c: I 'm just what I 'm wondering is whether I think for word - level , this would be OK . grad c: For lower than word - level , you 're talking about so much data that I just I don't know . I don't know if that phd f: we actually have So , one thing that Don is doing , is we 're we 're running For every frame , you get a pitch value , phd d: Lattices are big , too . phd f: and not only one pitch value but different kinds of pitch values grad c: Yeah , for something like that I would use P - file phd f: depending on grad c: or or any frame - level stuff I would use P - file . phd d: But what what 's the advantage of doing that versus just putting it into this format ? grad c: More compact , which I think is is better . grad c: if you did it at this phd f:  these are long meetings and with for every frame , grad c: You don't want to do it with that Anything at frame - level you had better encode binary phd f:  grad c: or it 's gonna be really painful .  , b you can always , G - zip them , and , you know , c decompress them on the fly if y if space is really a concern . phd d: Yeah , I was thi I was thinking the advantage is that we can share this with other people . grad c: Well , but if you 're talking about one per frame , you 're talking about gigabyte - size files . These are really  grad c: Right ? Because you have a two - gigabyte limit on most O Ss . But for phone - level stuff it 's perfectly phd f: And th it 's phd a: Like phones , or syllables , or anything like that . So , you know , people don't v Look at it , words times the average The average number of phones in an English word is , I don't know , five maybe ? phd f: Yeah , but we actually phd a: So , look at it , t number of words times five . That 's not that not phd f: Oh , so you mean pause phones take up a lot of the long pause phones . grad c: So I think it it 's debatable whether you want to do phone - level in the same thing . grad c: But I think , a anything at frame - level , even P - file , is too verbose . phd f: I haven't seen this particular format , phd a: I 've I 've used them . phd a: I 've forgot what the str phd d: But , wait a minute , P - file for each frame is storing a vector of cepstral or PLP values , grad c: It 's whatever you want , actually . grad c: So that what 's nice about the P - file It i Built into it is the concept of frames , utterances , sentences , that sort of thing , that structure . So , the only problem with it is it 's actually storing the utterance numbers and the frame numbers in the file , even though they 're always sequential . Is there some documentation on this somewhere ? grad c: Yeah , there 's a ton of it . I I was just looking for something I 'm not a database person , but something sort of standard enough that , you know , if we start using this we can give it out , other people can work on it , grad c: Yeah , it 's not standard . phd f: or Is it ? grad c: it 's something that we developed at ICSI . But ,  phd f: But it 's been used here grad c: But it 's been used here phd f: and people 've grad c: and and , you know , we have a well - configured system that you can distribute for free , and phd d: it must be the equivalent of whatever you guys used to store feat your computed features in , right ? phd f: OK . phd a: Yeah , th we have Actually , we we use a generalization of the the Sphere format . phd a: but Yeah , so there is something like that but it 's , probably not as sophist grad c: Well , what does H T K do for features ? phd d: And I think there 's grad c: Or does it even have a concept of features ? phd a: They ha it has its own  , Entropic has their own feature format that 's called , like , S - SD or some so SF or something like that . grad c: I 'm just wondering , would it be worth while to use that instead ? phd d: Yeah . Th - this is exactly the kind of decision It 's just whatever phd d: But , people don't typically share this kind of stuff , right ? phd a: Right . phd f: Actually , I I just you know , we we 've done this stuff on prosodics and three or four places have asked for those prosodic files , and we just have an ASCII , output of frame - by - frame . phd f: Which is fine , but it gets unwieldy to go in and and query these files with really huge files . I was just thinking if there 's something that where all the frame values are grad c: And a and again , if you have a if you have a two - hour - long meeting , that 's gonna phd f:  ? They 're they 're fair they 're quite large . phd f: and So it 's doable , it 's just that you can only store a feature vector at frame - by - frame and it doesn't have any kind of , phd d: Is is the sharing part of this a pretty important consideration phd f:  phd d: or does that just sort of ,  a nice thing to have ? phd f: I I don't know enough about what we 're gonna do with the data . But I thought it would be good to get something that we can that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of encoding . phd f: And especially for the prosody work , what what it ends up being is you get features from the signal , and of course those change every time your alignments change . So you re - run a recognizer , you want to recompute your features , and then keep the database up to date . phd f: Or you change a word , or you change a utterance boundary segment , which is gonna happen a lot . And so I wanted something where all of this can be done in a elegant way and that if somebody wants to try something or compute something else , that it can be done flexibly .  , it doesn't have to be pretty , it just has to be , you know , easy to use , and grad c: Yeah , the other thing We should look at ATLAS , the NIST thing , phd f: Oh . phd f:  grad c: I 'm not sure what to do about this with ATLAS , because they chose a different route . Your your file format can know about know that you 're talking about language and speech , which is what I chose , and time , or your file format can just be a graph representation . So what it looked like ATLAS chose is , they chose the other way , which was their file format is just nodes and links , and you have to interpret what they mean yourself . phd f: And why did you not choose that type of approach ? grad c: because I knew that we were doing speech , and I thought it was better if you 're looking at a raw file to be t for the tags to say \" it 's an utterance \" , as opposed to the tag to say \" it 's a link \" . grad c: So , but phd f: But other than that , are they compatible ?  , you could sort of grad c: Yeah , they 're reasonably compatible . phd f: Yeah , that 's w So , grad c: So , well , the other thing is if we choose to use ATLAS , which maybe we should just do , we should just throw this out before we invest a lot of time in it . phd f: just sort of how to  , cuz we need to come up with a database like this just to do our work . And I actually don't care , as long as it 's something useful to other people , what we choose . phd f: So maybe it 's maybe oth you know , if if you have any idea of how to choose , cuz I don't . phd a: Do they already have tools ? grad c: I I chose this for a couple reasons . phd f: And you can have as much information in the tag as you want , right ? grad c: Well , I have it structured . So what What NIST would say is that instead of doing this , you would say something like \" link start equals , you know , some node ID , phd f: Yeah . So grad c: end equals some other node ID \" , and then \" type \" would be \" utterance \" . phd f: So why would it be a a waste to do it this way if it 's similar enough that we can always translate it ? phd d: It probably wouldn't be a waste . It would mean that at some point if we wanted to switch , we 'd just have to translate everything . But it se Since they are developing a big phd f: But it but that sounds phd d: But that 's I don't think that 's a big deal . And so it seems to me that if if we want to use that , we might as well go directly to what they 're doing , rather than phd a: If we want to Do they already have something that 's that would be useful for us in place ? phd d: Yeah .  , how stable is their Are they ready to go , grad c: The I looked at it phd d: or ? grad c: The last time I looked at it was a while ago , probably a year ago , when we first started talking about this . Since then , they 've developed their own external file format , which is , you know , this sort of s this sort of thing .  , and apparently they 've also developed a lot of tools , but I haven't looked at them . phd f: would the tools would the tools run on something like this , if you can translate them anyway ? grad c: th what would would would what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail phd a: It 's a hassle phd f: that I guess it 's a question that phd a: if phd f: yeah . phd a: I I think if it 's conceptually close , and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using , it would be crazy to do something s you know , separate that phd f: OK . phd f: Actually , so it 's that that would really be the question , is just what you would feel is in the long run the best thing . phd f: Cuz once we start , sort of , doing this I don't we don't actually have enough time to probably have to rehash it out again grad c: The Yep . The other thing the other way that I sort of established this was as easy translation to and from the Transcriber format . But , I suppose that as long as they have a type here that specifies \" utt \" , grad c: It 's almost the same . phd f: it 's yeah , close enough that grad c: The the the the point is with this , though , is that you can't really add any supplementary information . Right ? So if you suddenly decide that you want phd f: You have to make a different type . phd f: So Well , if you look at it and  , I guess in my mind I don't know enough Jane would know better , about the types of annotations and and But I imagine that those are things that would well , you guys mentioned this , that could span any it could be in its own channel , it could span time boundaries of any type , grad c: Right . And then at the prosody - level we have frame sort of like cepstral feature files , grad c: Yep . And that 's sort of the world of things that I And then we have the aligned channels , of course , grad c: Right . phd a: And then phd f: I I definitely agree and I wanted to find actually a f a nicer format or a maybe a more compact format than what we used before . phd f: Just cuz you 've got ten channels or whatever and two hours of a meeting . phd a: Now now how would you how would you represent , multiple speakers in this framework ? Were You would just represent them as grad c: phd a: You would have like a speaker tag or something ? grad c: there 's a spea speaker tag up at the top which identifies them and then each utt the way I had it is each turn or each utterance , I don't even remember now , had a speaker ID tag attached to it . grad c: And in this format you would have a different tag , which which would , be linked to the link . grad c:  Let 's see , would it be a node or a link ?  And so so this one would have , an ID is link link seventy - four or something like that . grad c: And then somewhere up here you would have a link that that , you know , was referencing L - seventy - four and had speaker Adam . phd f: Actually , it 's the channel , I think , that phd a: Well , channel or speaker or whatever . phd f: w yeah , channel is what the channelized output out phd a: It doesn't grad c: This isn't quite right . phd f: Yeah , but phd a: But but so how in the NIST format do we express a hierarchical relationship between , say , an utterance and the words within it ? So how do you tell that these are the words that belong to that utterance ? grad c: you would have another structure lower down than this that would be saying they 're all belonging to this ID . And then each utterance could refer to a turn , phd d: So it 's it 's not hi it 's sort of bottom - up . phd f: And what if you actually have So right now what you have as utterance , the closest thing that comes out of the channelized is the stuff between the segment boundaries that the transcribers put in or that Thilo put in , which may or may not actually be , like , a s it 's usually not  , the beginning and end of a sentence , say . phd f: So , I assume this is possible , that if you have someone annotates the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe , you can say , you know , from for from the c beginning of the sentence to the end of the sentence , from the annotations , this is a unit , even though it never actually i It 's only a unit by virtue of the annotations at the word - level . grad c: And , what phd f: But it 's just not overtly in the phd a: OK . phd f: cuz this is exactly the kind of phd a: So phd f: I think that should be possible as long as the But , what I don't understand is where the where in this type of file that would be expressed . phd f: S so it would just be floating before the sentence or floating after the sentence without a time - mark . grad c: You could have some sort of link type type equals \" sentence \" , and ID is \" S - whatever \" . phd a:  grad c: Can you can you say that this is part of this , phd f: See , cuz it 's phd a: Hhh . phd f: it 's phd d: You would just have a r phd f: S grad c: or do you say this is part of this ? I think phd d: You would refer up to the sentence . phd f: But they 're phd a: Well , the thing phd f: they 're actually overlapping each other , sort of . grad c: So phd a: the thing is that some something may be a part of one thing for one purpose and another thing of another purpose . phd a: s  , well , s let 's let 's ta so let 's grad c: Well , I think I 'm I think w I had better look at it again phd f: Yeah . phd a: y So for instance @ @ sup grad c: There 's one level there 's one more level of indirection that I 'm forgetting . phd a: Suppose you have a word sequence and you have two different segmentations of that same word sequence . phd a: I don't know if that 's true or not but let 's as phd f: Well , it 's definitely true with the segment . phd f: That 's what I exactly what I meant by the utterances versus the sentence could be sort of phd a: Yeah . So , you want to be s you want to say this this word is part of that sentence and this prosodic phrase . grad c: I I 'm pretty sure that you can do that , but I 'm forgetting the exact level of nesting . phd a: So , you would have to have two different pointers from the word up one level up , one to the sent grad c: So so what you would end up having is a tag saying \" here 's a word , and it starts here and it ends here \" . grad c: And then lower down you would say \" here 's a prosodic boundary and it has these words in it \" . phd f: So you would be able to go in and say , you know , \" give me all the words in the bound in the prosodic phrase grad c: Yep . The the o the other issue that you had was , how do you actually efficiently extract ,  find and extract information in a structure of this type ? phd f: OK . phd a: So you gave some examples like phd f: Well , and , you guys might I don't know if this is premature because I suppose once you get the representation you can do this , but the kinds of things I was worried about is , phd a: No , that 's not clear . phd f:  phd a: yeah , you c sure you can do it , phd f: Well , OK . So i if it phd a: but can you do it sort of l l you know , it phd f: I  , I can't do it , but I can  , phd a: y y you gotta you gotta do this you you 're gonna want to do this very quickly grad c: Well phd a: or else you 'll spend all your time sort of searching through very complex data structures phd f: Right . But an example would be \" find all the cases in which Adam started to talk while Andreas was talking and his pitch was rising , Andreas 's pitch \" .  , that 's gonna be Is the rising pitch a feature , or is it gonna be in the same file ? phd f: Well , the rising pitch will never be hand - annotated . So the all the prosodic features are going to be automatically grad c: But the  , that 's gonna be hard regardless , phd f: So they 're gonna be in those grad c: right ? Because you 're gonna have to write a program that goes through your feature file and looks for rising pitches . So normally what we would do is we would say \" what do we wanna assign rising pitch to ? \" Are we gonna assign it to words ? Are we gonna just assign it to sort of when it 's rising we have a begin - end rise representation ? But suppose we dump out this file and we say , for every word we just classify it as , w you know , rise or fall or neither ? grad c: OK . grad c: r phd f: So we would basically be sort of , taking the format and enriching it with things that we wanna query in relation to the words that are already in the file , grad c: Right . phd a: You want sort of a grep that 's that works at the structural on the structural representation . There 's a standard again in XML , specifically for searching XML documents structured X - XML documents , where you can specify both the content and the structural position . phd a: Yeah , but it 's it 's not clear that that 's That 's relative to the structure of the XML document , phd f: If phd a: not to the structure of what you 're representing in the document . grad c: It 's it 's you would use that to build your tool to do that sort of search . phd f: But as long as the grad c: It 's a graph , but phd a: That 's different from searching through the text . phd f: But it seems like as long as the features that grad c: Well , no , no , no . phd a:  grad c: So that  th phd f: That 's true if the features from your acoustics or whatever that are not explicitly in this are at the level of these types . phd f: That that if you can do that grad c: Yeah , but that 's gonna be the trouble no matter what . Right ? No matter what format you choose , you 're gonna have the trou you 're gonna have the difficulty of relating the the frame - level features phd f: That 's right . phd f: You know , it Or another example was , you know , where in the language where in the word sequence are people interrupting ? So , I guess that one 's actually easier . phd d: What about what about , the idea of using a relational database to , store the information from the XML ? So you would have XML basically would  , you you could use the XML to put the data in , and then when you get data out , you put it back in XML . phd d: but then you store the data in the database , which allows you to do all kinds of good search things in there . grad c: The ,  One of the things that ATLAS is doing is they 're trying to define an API which is independent of the back store , phd f: Huh . grad c: so that , you could define a single API and the the storage could be flat XML files or a database . grad c: My opinion on that is for the s sort of stuff that we 're doing , I suspect it 's overkill to do a full relational database , that , just a flat file and , search tools I bet will be enough . phd a: But grad c: But that 's the advantage of ATLAS , is that if we actually take decide to go that route completely and we program to their API , then if we wanted to add a database later it would be pretty easy . phd f: It seems like the kind of thing you 'd do if I don't know , if people start adding all kinds of s bells and whistles to the data . And so that might be  , it 'd be good for us to know to use a format where we know we can easily , input that to some database if other people are using it . grad c: I guess I 'm just a little hesitant to try to go whole hog on sort of the the whole framework that that NIST is talking about , with ATLAS and a database and all that sort of stuff , phd f: So grad c: cuz it 's a big learning curve , just to get going . grad c: Whereas if we just do a flat file format , sure , it may not be as efficient but everyone can program in Perl and and use it . grad c: Right ? phd a: But this is grad c: So , as opposed to phd a: I I 'm still , not convinced that you can do much at all on the text on the flat file that that you know , the text representation . e Because the text representation is gonna be , not reflecting the structure of of your words and annotations . It 's just it 's grad c: Well , if it 's not representing it , then how do you recover it ? Of course it 's representing it . You you have to what you have to do is you have to basically grad c: That 's the whole point . grad c: Right ? So what I was saying is that phd a: But that 's what you 'll have to do . And it 's a set of tools that let you specify given the D - DDT DTD of the document , what sorts of structural searches you want to do . So you want to say that , you know , you 're looking for , a tag within a tag within a particular tag that has this particular text in it , and , refers to a particular value . And so the point isn't that an end - user , who is looking for a query like you specified , wouldn't program it in this language . phd f: Is a See , I think the kinds of questions , at least in the next to the end of this year , are there may be a lot of different ones , but they 'll all have a similar nature . They 'll be looking at either a word - level prosodic , an a value , grad c:   But you know , we 'll do something where we some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o  , either at the word - level or at the segment - level , grad c: Right . They 're not gonna be at the phone - level and they 're no not gonna be at the frame - level when we get done with sort of giving them simpler shapes and things .  , one that Chuck mentioned is starting out with something that we don't have to start over , that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions , grad c: Right . phd f: and being able to at least get enough , information out on where we condition the location of features on information that 's in the kind of file that you put up there . grad c: And so it seems to me that  , I have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want , but if we use the ATLAS external file representation , it seems like it 's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as I said in Perl , and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve , we can use the whole ATLAS inter infrastructure , phd f: Yeah . phd f: I I don't So if if you would l look at that and let us know what you think . phd f: I think we 're sort of guinea pigs , cuz I I want to get the prosody work done but I don't want to waste time , you know , getting the phd a: Oh , maybe phd f: Yeah ? phd a:  grad c: Well , I wouldn't wait for the formats , because anything you pick we 'll be able to translate to another form . phd a: Well Ma well , maybe you should actually look at it yourself too to get a sense of what it is you 'll you 'll be dealing with , phd f: OK . phd a: because , you know , Adam might have one opinion but you might have another , so grad b: Yeah . phd f: Especially if there 's , e  you know , if someone can help with at least the the setup of the right grad c: Hi , Jane . phd f: the right representation , then , i you know , I hope it won't We don't actually need the whole full - blown thing to be ready , grad c: Can you Oh , well .  , so maybe if you guys can look at it and sort of see what , grad b: Yeah . phd f:  I think we 're we 're we 're actually just grad c: We 're about done . phd f: wrapping up , but ,  Yeah , sorry , it 's a  short meeting , but ,  Well , I don't know . Is there anything else , like  that helps me a lot , grad c: Well , I think the other thing we might want to look at is alternatives to P - file . phd f: but grad c: th the reason I like P - file is I 'm already familiar with it , we have expertise here , and so if we pick something else , there 's the learning - curve problem . phd a: Is there an is there an IP - API ? grad c: And so Yeah . And , phd a: There used to be a problem that they get too large , grad c: a bunch of libraries , P - file utilities . phd a: and so basically the  the filesystem wouldn't grad c: Well , that 's gonna be a problem no matter what . phd a: Maybe you could extend the API to , support , like splitting up , you know , conceptually one file into smaller files on disk so that you can essentially , you know , have arbitrarily long f grad c: Yep . That that most many of them can s you can specify several P - files and they 'll just be done sequentially . phd f: So , I guess , yeah , if if you and Don can if you can show him the P - file stuff and see . grad c: if you do \" man P - file \" or \" apropos P - file \" , you 'll see a lot . phd f: Yeah ? phd d: I don't remember what the \" P \" is , though . grad c: But there are ni they 're The Quicknet library has a bunch of things in it to handle P - files , phd a: Yeah . phd a:  phd f: And that isn't really , I guess , as important as the the main I don't know what you call it , the the main sort of word - level grad c: Neither do I .  , so grad c: Yeah , I 've been meaning to look at the ATLAS stuff again anyway . I guess it 's also sort of a political deci  , if if you feel like that 's a community that would be good to tie into anyway , then it 's sounds like it 's worth doing . grad c: Yeah , I think it it w phd a: j I think there 's grad c: And , w  , as I said , I what I did with this stuff I based it on theirs . So now that they have come up with a format , it doesn't it seems pretty reasonable to use it . grad c: As I said , that phd f: Cuz we actually can start grad c: There 's one level there 's one more level of indirection and I 'm just blanking on exactly how it works . phd f: we can start with , I guess , this input from Dave 's , which you had printed out , the channelized input . Cuz he has all of the channels , you know , with the channels in the tag and stuff like that . And so then it would just be a matter of getting making sure to handle the annotations that are , you know , not at the word - level and , t to import the grad b: Where are those annotations coming from ? phd f: Well , right now , I g Jane would would grad c:   postdoc e: Are you talking about the overlap a annotations ? phd f: Yeah , any kind of annotation that , like , isn't already there . And since we w we I I think it 's important to remain flexible regarding the time bins for now . And so it 's nice to have However , you know , you want to have it , time time  , located in the discourse . So , if we if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap , then you 'll have a time - marking . It won't it 'll be independent of the time bins , however these e evolve , shrink , or whatever , increase , or Also , you could have different time bins for different purposes . And having it tied to the first word in an overlap segment is unique , you know , anchored , clear . postdoc e: Or the ? phd d: I 'm not sure what that @ @ grad c: Well , is that phd d: It probably doesn't matter . phd d: No , I d postdoc e: We don't have to go into the codes . W the idea is just to have a separate green ribbon , you know , and and and let 's say that this is a time bin . This is the first word of an overlapping segment of any length , overlapping with any other , word  , i segment of any length . And , then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a ch a backchannel , or you can say that it was , a usurping of the turn , or you can you know , any any number of categories . But the fact is , you have it time - tagged in a way that 's independent of the , sp particular time bin that the word ends up in . postdoc e: we sh change the boundaries of the units , it 's still unique and and , fits with the format , phd f: Right . phd a: it would be nice  , eh , gr this is sort of r regarding  ,  it 's related but not directly germane to the topic of discussion , but , when it comes to annotations , you often find yourself in the situation where you have different annotations of the same , say , word sequence . phd a: And sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited s at one place but not the other . phd a: So , once this data gets out there , some people might start annotating this for , I don't know , dialogue acts or , you know , topics or what the heck . And the only thing that is really sort of common among all the versi the various versions of this data is the word sequence , or approximately . But , see , if you 'd annotate dialogue acts , you don't necessarily want to or topics you don't really want to be dealing with time - marks . phd a: You 'd it 's much more efficient for them to just see the word sequence , right ? phd f:   phd a: most people aren't as sophisticated as as we are here with , you know , time alignments and stuff . So So the the the point is grad c: Should should we mention some names on the people who are n ? phd a: Right . So , the p my point is that you 're gonna end up with , word sequences that are differently annotated . And you want some tool , that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single , version . OK ?  , and we had this problem very massively , at SRI when we worked , a while back on ,  well , on dialogue acts as well as , you know , what was it ?  , phd f: Well , all the Switchboard in it . phd a: Because we had one set of annotations that were based on , one version of the transcripts with a particular segmentation , and then we had another version that was based on , a different s slightly edited version of the transcripts with a different segmentation . So , we had these two different versions which were you know , you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical . So it was extremely hard to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations . But once you have a file format , I can imagine writing not personally , but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool , that mediates between various versions , phd f:   phd a: and  , sort of like th  , you know , you have this thing in UNIX where you have , diff . phd a: There 's the , diff that actually tries to reconcile different two diffs f based on the same original . phd a: Something like that , but operating on these lattices that are really what 's behind this  , this annotation format . phd a: So grad c: There 's actually a diff library you can use to do things like that that so you have different formats . phd f: You could definitely do that with the phd a: So somewhere in the API you would like to have like a merge or some some function that merges two two versions . phd f: But the one thing that would work here actually for i that is more reliable than the utterances is the the speaker ons and offs . So if you have a good , grad c: But this is exactly what  , is that that the problem i phd f:  Yeah . The problem is saying \" what are the semantics , phd f: And grad c: what do you mean by \" merge \" ? \" phd f: Right , right . So so just to let you know what we where we kluged it by , doing  , by doing Hhh . phd a: Both were based on words , so , bo we have two versions of the same words intersp you know , sprinkled with with different tags for annotations . phd a: And that 's how grad c: That 's just wh how I would have done it . But , you know , it had lots of errors and things would end up in the wrong order , and so forth . phd a: it it was a kluge because it was basically reducing everything to  , to  , to textual alignment . grad c: A textual phd a: so phd f: But , d isn't that something where whoever if if the people who are making changes , say in the transcripts , cuz this all happened when the transcripts were different ye  , if they tie it to something , like if they tied it to the acoustic segment if they You know what  ? Then Or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time - marks , that would help . phd f: But the problem is exactly as Adam said , that you get , you know , y you don't have that information or it 's lost in the merge somehow , postdoc e: Well , can I ask one question ? phd f: so postdoc e: It it seems to me that , we will have o an official version of the corpus , which will be only one one version in terms of the words where the words are concerned . We 'd still have the the merging issue maybe if coding were done independently of the phd a: And you 're gonna get that postdoc e: But but phd a: because if the data gets out , people will do all kinds of things to it . And , s you know , several years from now you might want to look into , the prosody of referring expressions . And so that 's exactly what we should somehow when you distribute the data , say that you know , that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that . postdoc e: Well , then the phd d: What 's what 's wrong with doing times ? I postdoc e: I agree . phd f: yeah , time is the grad c: Well , postdoc e: Time is unique . You were saying that you didn't think we should phd f: Time is passing ! phd a: Time time times are ephemeral . grad c: what if they haven't notated with them , times ? phd f: Yeah . postdoc e: But then couldn't you just indirectly figure out the time tied to the word ? phd f: But still they Exactly . phd d: But can they change the words without changing the time of the word ? grad c: Sure . The the point is , that that they may have annotated it off a word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript , so how do you merge it back in ? I understand what you 're saying . grad c: And I I guess the answer is , it 's gonna be different every time . grad c: I it 's exactly what I said before , phd f: You only know the boundaries of the grad c: which is that \" what do you mean by \" merge \" ? \" So in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times , well , what do you mean by \" merge \" ? If you tell me what you mean , I can write a program to do it . phd f: And beyond that , all you know is is relative ordering and sometimes even that is wrong . grad c: So so in so in this one you would have to do a best match between the word sequences , phd f: So . grad c: extract the times f from the best match of theirs to yours , and use that . postdoc e: But it could be that they just  , it could be that they chunked they they lost certain utterances and all that stuff , grad c: Right , exactly . phd f: Well , I guess , w I I didn't want to keep people too long and Adam wanted t people I 'll read the digits . phd f: if not , I guess phd a: For th for the for the benefit of science we 'll read the digits "

        "Query": "What is the professor's opinion on the pragmatic overview of the project and can you summarize the discussion surrounding it?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed potential improvements for their model, specifically focusing on MSG and multi-band. However, the professor acknowledged that the task was challenging and their current model was not yet suitable for a real system. Despite this, the team was enthusiastic about the Aurora data, which provided a more realistic scenario, and expressed their interest in continuing to explore the task. The professor emphasized the need for further work and encouraged the team to share any ideas they had for pursuing new directions. He suggested experimenting with MSG and multi-band himself and also recommended learning more about different acoustic environments.",
        "Article": "So ,  You can fill those out ,  after , actually , so So , I got ,  these results from , Stephane . I think s that , there were some other very good results that we 're gonna wanna compare to . phd a: I I 'm sorry ? I didn't professor d: I got this from you phd a: Yeah . professor d: and then I sent a note to Sunil about the cuz he has been running some other systems phd a:   professor d: You know most of the time , even  even though it 's true that the overall number for Danish we didn't improve it If you look at it individually , what it really says is that there 's ,  Looks like out of the six cases , between the different kinds of , matching conditions out of the six cases , there 's basically , a couple where it stays about the same , three where it gets better , and one where it gets worse . phd a: Y Actually , for the Danish , there 's still some kind of mystery because , when we use the straight features , we are not able to get these nice number with the ICSI OGI one ,  . We don't have this ninety - three seventy - eight , we have eight phd e: Eighty - nine forty - four . professor d: Oh , and and we have a little time on that and actually so phd a:  ? professor d: We have a little bit of time on that , actually . professor d: We have a day or so , so When when when do you folks leave ? phd a: Sunday . professor d: Sunday ? So So ,  Yeah , until Saturday midnight , or something , we have W we we have time , yeah .  , and , you know , i u when whenever anybody figures it out they should also , for sure , email Hynek because Hynek will be over there telling people what we did , so he should know .  , even with these results as they are , it 's it 's it 's really not that bad . But but ,  And it looks like the overall result as they are now , even without , you know , any any bugs being fixed is that , on the the other tasks , we had this average of , forty  nine percent , or so , improvement . And here we have somewhat better than that than the Danish , and somewhat worse than that on the German , but  , it sounds like , one way or another , the methods that we 're doing can reduce the error rate from from mel ceptrum down by , you know a fourth of them to , a half of them .  , I think that , one of the things that Hynek was talking about was understanding what was in the other really good proposals and and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some , combination of things .  , if ,  Cuz there 's things that they are doing there that we certainly are not doing . phd c: How much how much better was the best system than ours ? professor d: So Well , we don't know yet . professor d: first place , there 's still this thing to to work out , and second place second thing is that the only results that we have so far from before were really development set results . And the best result of any system was about fifty - four , where these numbers are the , relative , reduction in , word error rate . professor d: And here the the worst system still reduced the error rate by thirty - three percent , or something , in development set . professor d: So so , you know , sort of everybody is doing things between , well , roughly a third of the errors , and half the errors being eliminated , and varying on different test sets and so forth . professor d: So I think  It 's probably a good time to look at what 's really going on and seeing if there 's a there 's a way to combine the best ideas while at the same time not blowing up the amount of , resources used , cuz that 's that 's critical for this this test . phd c: Do we know anything about who who 's was it that had the lowest on the dev set ? professor d: the , the there were two systems that were put forth by a combination of of , French Telecom and Alcatel . And ,  they they differed in some respects , but they e em one was called the French Telecom Alcatel System the other was called the Alcatel French Telecom System , which is the biggest difference , I think . professor d: you know ? So , my impression is they also did very well on on the the , evaluation set , but , I I we haven't seen you 've - you haven't seen any final results for that phd c: And they used the main thing that that they used was spectral subtraction ? professor d: yeah . And then then there was some p some modification of the cepstral parameters , where they phd a: Yeah , actually , something that 's close to cepstral mean subtraction . I 'm I 'm ,  So , basically , the mean is adapted during speech and not during silence . professor d: But some people have done exactly that sort of thing , of of and the  it 's not To to look in speech only , to try to m to measure these things during speech , phd a: Yeah , yeah . But i it it so it looks like they did some some , reasonable things , and they 're not things that we did , precisely . We did unreasonable things , which because we like to try strange things , and and , and our things worked too . professor d: And so , it 's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do . But the only caveat to that is that everybody 's being real conscious of how much memory and how much CPU they 're using phd c:   professor d: because these , standards are supposed to go on cell phones with m moderate resources in both respects . phd c: Did anybody , do anything with the models as a an experiment ? Or professor d: they didn't report it , if they did .  , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a a ,  a filtering , which leads to a a ,  a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample . It it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested , they were repeating the packets . So it was they were s they they had twenty - four hundred bits per second , but they were literally creating forty - eight hundred bits per second , even though y it was just repeated . professor d: So , in practice phd c: So you could 've had a repeat count in there or something . professor d: Well , n  , this was just a ph phoney thing just to to fit into the the software that was testing the errors channel errors and so on . professor d: So so in reality , if you put this this system in into , the field , it would be twenty - four hundred bits per second , not forty - eight hundred . phd c: When is the development set  , the , test set results due ? Like the day before you leave or something ? professor d: probably the day after they leave , but we 'll have to we 'll have to stop it the day before we leave . So phd a: Yeah , probably , well professor d: I th I think I I think they are , phd a: Yeah , well professor d: yeah . So  , since we have a bit farther to travel than some of the others , we 'll have to get done a little quicker .  , just exactly this sort of thing of , you know , why why these features seem to be behaving differently , in California than in Oregon .  , we didn't we didn't have enough electrons here and  , but , I think , you know , the main reason for having  , it only takes w to run the the two test sets in just in computer time is just a day or so , right ? phd a: Yeah , professor d: So phd a: it 's very short interval . So , I think the who the whole reason for having as long as we have , which was like a week and a half , is is because of bugs like that . So Huh So , we 're gonna end up with these same kind of sheets that have the the percentages and so on just for the phd a: Yeah , so there are two more columns in the sheets , professor d: Oh , I guess it 's the same sheets , phd a: two . phd a: So , Hynek will try to push for trying to combine , different things ? Or  ? professor d: well that 's  yeah  , I think the question is \" Is there is there some advantage ? \"  , you could just take the best system and say that 's the standard . But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things , a again within the constraint of the resources , if there 's something simple that you can do Now for instance , it 's , I think , very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal 's side and then for the server 's side say , \" Here 's a number of things that could be done . \" So , everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did , and i it 'd probably work pretty well with them , too . And then on the terminal 's side , I don't know how much , memory and and CPU it takes , but it seems like the filtering  , the VAD stuff they both had , right ? And , so and they both had some kind of on - line normalization , right ? phd a: yeah . professor d: Of sorts , yeah ? So so , it seems like the main different there is the is the , filtering . And the filtering I think if you can shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that  , and I also wouldn't think the CPU , would be much either for that part . So , if you can if you can add those in  then , you can cut the data rate in half . professor d: So it seems like the right thing to do is to on the on the terminal 's side , take what they did , if it if it does seem to generalize well to German and Danish , take what they did add in a filter , and add in some stuff on the server 's side and and and that 's probably a reasonable standard .   phd a: They are working on this already ? Because yeah , Su - Sunil told me that he was trying already to put some kind of , filtering in the France Telecom . professor d: Yeah , so that 's that 's that 's what That would be ideal would be is that they could , you know , they could actually show that , in fact , a combination of some sort , would work even better than what what any of the systems had .  , you can always have another standard after that , but this process has gone on for a while on already and and people might just wanna pick something and say , \" OK , this is it . It 's just that , if you disobey them , then you risk not being able to sell your product , or   And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on . The other hand , they might just say they just don't know enough yet to to declare a standard . So you you you will be you will become experts on this and know more far more than me about the tha this particular standards process once you you go to this meeting .  , you 're done in the sense that , you may be able to get some new features from Sunil , and we 'll re - run it .  , but other than that , you 're you 're basically done , right ? So , I 'm interested in hearing hearing your thoughts about where you think we should go from this . professor d: we tried a lot of things in a hurry , and , if we can back off from this now and sort of take our time with something , and not have doing things quickly be quite so much the constraint , what what you think would be the best thing to do . phd a: well  Well , first , to really have a look at at the speech from these databases because , well , we tried several thing , but we did not really look at what what 's happening , and where is the noise , and professor d: OK . Actually , there is one thing that well  , generally we we think that most of the errors are within phoneme classes , and so I think it could be interesting to to see if it I don't think it 's still true when we add noise , and so we have I I guess the confusion ma the confusion matrices are very different when when we have noise , and when it 's clean speech . phd a: And so ,  Yeah , so perhaps we could have a a large gain , eh , just by looking at improving the , recognition , not of phonemes , but of phoneme classes , simply . phd a: And which is a s a s a simpler problem , perhaps , but which is perhaps important for noisy speech . professor d: The other thing that strikes me , just looking at these numbers is , just taking the best cases , some of these , of course , even with all of our our wonderful processing , still are horrible kinds of numbers . But just take the best case , the well - matched  , German case after er well - matched Danish after we phd a:   professor d: the kind of numbers we 're getting are about eight or nine  p percent error per digit . professor d: if you have ten digits for a phone number  , every now and then you 'll get it right .  , it 's it 's ,  So , the other thing is that ,  And and a and and also ,  part of what 's nice about this is that this is ,  a realistic almost realistic database .  , it 's still not people who are really trying to accomplish something , but but , within the artificial setup , it isn't noise artificially added , you know , simulated , additive noise . And , the the training the training , I guess , is always done on the close talking phd a: No , actually actually the well - matched condition is still quite di still quite difficult . professor d: No ? phd a: it 's they have all these data from the close mike and from the distant mike , from different driving condition , open window , closed window , professor d: Yeah . phd a: and they take all of this and they take seventy percent , I think , for training and thirty percent for testing . phd a: So , training is done on different conditions and different microphones , and testing also is done on different microphone and conditions . So , probably if we only take the close microphones , I guess the results should be much much better than this . Wha - what about i in so the the phd a: Yeah , so there is this , the mismatched is ,  the same kind of thing , professor d: go ahead . phd a: but the driving conditions ,  the speed and the kind of road , is different for training and testing , is that right ? phd e: Yeah . So , yeah , so the high so the right so the highly mismatched case is in some sense a good model for what we 've been , you know , typically talking about when we talk about additive noise in And so and i i k it does correspond to a realistic situation in the sense that , people might really be trying to , call out telephone numbers or some or something like that , in in their cars phd a: Yeah . professor d:  phd a: Actually , yeah , it 's very close to clean speech training because , well , because the close microphone and noisy speech testing , professor d: Yeah . And the well - matched condition is what you might imagine that you might be able to approach , if you know that this is the application . And then , when y you sell it to somebody , they will be a different person with a different car , and so on . So it 's this is a an optim somewhat optimistic view on it , so , you know , the real thing is somewhere in between the two . professor d: but phd a: But the  , the th th professor d: Even the optimistic one is phd a: it doesn't work . So , in a way , that 's , you know , that 's sort of the dominant thing is that even , say on the development set stuff that we saw , the , the numbers that , that Alcatel was getting when choosing out the best single numbers , it was just you know , it wasn't good enough for for a a for a real system . professor d: and ,  I don't know So , looking at the data , where , you know what 's the what 's what 's th what 's characteristic i e yeah , I think that 's that 's a good thing . Does a any you have any thoughts about what else y you 're thinking that you didn't get to that you would like to do if you had more time ?  phd e: Oh , f a lot of thing . professor d: Yeah , cuz a lot of time it 's true , there were a lot of times when we 've tried something and it didn't work right away , even though we had an intuition that there should be something there .  And , one of the things I don't remember the details on , but I remember at some point , when you were working with a second stream , and you tried a low - pass filtering to cepstrum , in some case you got phd e: MSG Yeah . professor d: Well , but it was an MSG - like thing , but it wasn't MSG , right ?  , you y I think in some case you got some little improvement , but it was , you know , sort of a small improvement , and it was a a big added complication , so you dropped it . But , that was just sort of one try , right ? You just took one filter , threw it there , phd a: Yeah , professor d: right ? And it seems to me that , if that is an important idea , which , you know , might be , that one could work at it for a while , as you 're saying . professor d: And , and you had , you know , you had the multi - band things also , and , you know , there was issue of that . phd a: Yeah , professor d: Barry 's going to be , continuing working on multi - band things as well . Kind of inspired by the stuff by Larry Saul with the , learning articulatory feature in I think , in the case of his paper with sonorance based on , multi - band information where you have a a combination of gradient learning an and , EM . professor d: and  , so , I think that , you know , this is a ,  this is a neat data set .  , and then , as we mentioned before , we also have the the new , digit set coming up from recordings in this room .  and ,  what I like about it , in a way , is that , the results are still so terrible . But even after that it 's still , you know , so poor that that , no one could really use it . So ,  I think that 's great that because and y also because again , it 's not something sometimes we 've gotten terrible results by taking some data , and artificially , you know , convolving it with some room response , or something we take a very  , at one point , Brian and I went downstairs into the the basement where it was it was in a hallway where it was very reverberant and we we made some recordings there . And then we we , made a simulation of the of the room acoustics there and and applied it to other things , phd a:   professor d: and  But it was all pretty artificial , and and , you know , how often would you really try to have your most crucial conversations in this very reverberant hallway ?  So ,  This is what 's nice about the Aurora data and the data here , is that is that it 's sort of a realistic room situation  , acoustics acoustic situation , both terms in noise and reflections , and so on and n n And , with something that 's still relatively realistic , it 's still very very hard to do very well . phd a: Yeah , so d well Actually , this is tha that 's why we well , it 's a different kind of data . So this would be the first thing , and then , of course , try to well , kind of debug what was wrong , eh , when we do Aurora test on the MSG particularly , and on the multi - band . What do you think ? phd c: About professor d: Anything phd c: About other experiments ?  , now , I 'm interested in ,  looking at the experiments where you use , data from multiple languages to train the neural net . And I don't know how far , or if you guys even had a chance to try that , but that would be some it 'd be interesting to me . phd a: Yeah , but professor d: S b phd a: Again , it 's the kind of of thing that , we were thin thinking thinking that it would work , but it didn't work . And , eh , so there is kind of of not a bug , but something wrong in what we are doing , perhaps . phd a: something wrong , perhaps in the just in the the fact that the labels are phd c: Right . So one form of different data was is from different languages , but the other Well , i in fact , m in those experiments it wasn't so much combining multiple nets , it was a single net that had different phd a: Yeah . professor d: So , first thing is would it be better if they were multiple nets , for some reason ? Second thing is , never mind the different languages , just having acoustic conditions rather than training them all up in one , would it be helpful to have different ones ? So ,  That was a question that was kind of raised by Mike Shire 's thesis , and on in that case in terms of reverberation . Whe - when are you two getting back ? phd e: I 'm phd a: You on Friday or S on Saturday or ? phd e: Sunday phd a: S oh yeah , Sunday , yeah . You 've gotta S have a Saturday overnight , right ? phd a: I 'll be back on Tuesday . phd c: Where where 's the meeting ? professor d: Amsterdam , I think , yeah ? phd a: Yeah , Amsterdam . professor d: so Yeah , well , if we don't have an anything else to discuss , we should , turn off the machine and then say the real nasty things "

        "Query": "Why did User Interface propose using more buttons in the technical function design and what were the advantages of big thick keys? Additionally, what did the User Interface discuss about the shape of the button and what recommendations did the user interface designer make regarding the problem of having fewer buttons?",
        "Summary": "The User Interface team suggested reducing the number of buttons for DVD control compared to the current design, aiming to keep the maximum number of buttons within ten. Taking inspiration from mobile phones, they proposed using big thick keys for the remote control, which are popular among younger generations and create a less cluttered and more spacious look. The team agreed on a round shape for most buttons arranged in a triangle, with a square button in the middle and four buttons for channel and volume control. The industrial designer recommended incorporating multiple functions into one button using a switch menu, categorizing functions and linking them to specific menu categories.",
        "Article": "So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and  industrial designer: Industrial Design . project manager: And after that we  will have the  new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . project manager: No , industrial designer: Three three , it's three project manager: I'm participant one . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our  remote T_V_ control . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . So how can we  design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?  , let's move to next slide . As we know  Google it's a very successful because his  powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . project manager: user interface: So my job is to  design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So industrial designer: user interface: That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation . user interface:  With sophisticated functions , project manager: So powerful , user interface: but with very yeah powerful . marketing: So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , industrial designer: To merge the two system huh . marketing: industrial designer: But But this is user interface: But if we have very very good user interface marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . project manager: Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . industrial designer: So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that So . project manager: Go on , go back and industrial designer: Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright . marketing: industrial designer: It you project manager: So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . marketing: industrial designer: The rationale must be design , or project manager: So , Baba is the  the Industrial Designer . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know  to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the project manager: industrial designer: how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . industrial designer: but I propose a nifra infrared base you know , so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ project manager: marketing: industrial designer: so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to marketing: True . project manager: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? industrial designer: I think it's cheaper than laser , so . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen , marketing: What the cost is ? project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have   Let's see . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here project manager: You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . project manager: What is this ? industrial designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . industrial designer: So and the next slide , it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless . industrial designer: Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ? marketing: What's the average price of this technology then ? industrial designer: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the user interface: So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire with remote control ? industrial designer: You'd yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . project manager: So you think that  a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea . project manager: No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu marketing: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , user interface: Wireless remote control . project manager: but marketing: I don't think well , yeah , I don't think he would , industrial designer: Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know , project manager: marketing: but in a sense industrial designer: sometime I want to have wire because you know . project manager: Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have  linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? industrial designer: project manager: I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ? industrial designer: I don't think it will be too much . industrial designer: Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know project manager: Okay . industrial designer: I think wha wha with the wire it's  cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . marketing: Now the project manager: So industrial designer: Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . project manager: I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , marketing: Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else  . We had one hundred subjects , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , and see what was okay or not for them .  actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls  ugly , okay , so that's project manager: You mean the loo the look , the outside ? industrial designer: The look , how it look like . So this is where we could have  yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more . And then  yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . And  users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . project manager: marketing: So this is from the experiments we've done , project manager: marketing: so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .  it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And  remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . project manager: What is R_S_I_ ? marketing: R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same  doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . marketing: Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . marketing: And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of  functions , but less buttons , user interface: Functions . And just to have  an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? user interface: But I'm not sure project manager: Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . project manager: I think the marketing: It's user interface: No you you can have a switch menu , so you can project manager: Yeah , but it has to be intuitive . Then for  you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . Okay , user interface: Then you you put the switch button , project manager: but user interface: then it switch to another category of functions . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your  recorder . industrial designer: With a user interface: So there's a different functions , but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . project manager: Yeah , but user interface: But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . marketing: industrial designer: This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people . user interface: marketing: Yeah , this is something we sh user interface: Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and  uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so . industrial designer: I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard project manager: Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . user interface: Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: And also f user interface: Maybe we can have di di we can have  several options , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , marketing: Yeah , user interface: project manager: and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as  previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as  it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . project manager: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ . project manager: So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ? marketing: Yeah , it's done , just yeah . If we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it . project manager: So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that  for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's user interface: project manager: It's is  marketing: Lame , or project manager: No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext . project manager: So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , industrial designer: Yep . project manager: and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not you won't be  you won't had  buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . project manager: It's marketing: - project manager: because if we want to to do remote control user interface:  . project manager: which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . project manager: So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . project manager: And also we want the image of the   real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . project manager:  that's  if  you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . project manager: So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the   user interface: Okay . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so . project manager: industrial designer: This is marketing: I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . project manager: but mayb industrial designer: Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . user interface: A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ . industrial designer: It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . industrial designer: the global usage , user interface: Global , industrial designer: so if people don't have the technology . project manager: So everybody is okay with the new requirements ? user interface: So I I so As as for the colour , what what do you think ? project manager: I think it has to be yellow . user interface: Yellow ? T_V_ remote control ? marketing: Min project manager: Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised . industrial designer: I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Doesn't need to be completely yellow , project manager: So you have to user interface: Okay . It's okay ? marketing: Regarding the first line , what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .  Y you You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put  pon marketing: Industrial Designer . project manager: And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder <doc-sep>marketing: What's the agenda for this meeting ? project manager: The I will  present here agenda with with with with slides to you . I've also made notes of the previous meeting and  I was about to send them you but then  I had to go to this  meeting so you will get them too  marketing: project manager: Then I hope you all have  worked out some some  some some presentations about  about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .  then I will  bring in some some some new requirements I I got  from the  account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . project manager: and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the marketing:  . industrial designer: You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? project manager: Yes  well yes w who are we going to  to well to sell this , marketing:  . So And then  we will close this meeting  user interface: project manager: and after this meeting we'll  we'll have a lunch . Maybe  why  Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? marketing: No , I don't . project manager:  you want a table to to  marketing: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . project manager: Yes yes maybe maybe you can  can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary  . Well I've just been  presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . It's probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it .  seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . project manager: Do you Do you have this  information on the web page you said ? marketing: I have an a web page yes . So basically  there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control .  , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times  and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Teletext is used  fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . marketing: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that  fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . industrial designer: marketing: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . industrial designer: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's marketing: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . industrial designer: Not enough marketing: I don't know how we'd go about combating that . What do you mean there ? marketing: For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury . project manager: But it's it's the opinion of the  of the users huh ? marketing: Yeah . marketing:  and then it's got a demographic breakdown on industrial designer: Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the marketing:  I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . user interface: You can disconnect it there project manager: You can maybe just just user interface: no ? marketing: Oh no , yeah . industrial designer: Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional  user interface: Oh yeah . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . industrial designer: Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the  both yeah user interface and functional design . marketing: One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute . industrial designer: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint  our design based on what is more important . industrial designer: Speech recognition in marketing: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . industrial designer: So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control marketing: Well potentially yeah ,  project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it would be all based on speech . project manager: Well it would it would be a solution for  when your remote control is lost , marketing: project manager:  when it has speech recognition then  i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . industrial designer: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? user interface: Oh . Well , it depends you know like there is  it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , project manager:  . project manager: Yes , user interface: It's it's going to be li project manager: that that that that's  . user interface: it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case project manager: Do you have some more important facts user interface: but it's but I don't know with twenty fi marketing:  project manager: or can we go to the next presentation ? industrial designer: Okay . So marketing: Well industrial designer: you had to to to summarise maybe the marketing: This is now talking about  who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it ,  . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five ,  twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . marketing: Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , user interface: project manager:  . industrial designer: I thi You us marketing: It'll be in a different window , yep . marketing: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .  I okay project manager: Oh , industrial designer: I stay project manager: this is user interface: Now you can move I think yeah . user interface: It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , marketing: Sorry ? Oh .  I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very  technical background  what is it because I think in the product it is important . industrial designer: So basically  the basic function of a remote control is to send  messages to another system that is fixed . industrial designer: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually  through a  infrared bit marketing: So my method for  designing the yeah the work design  yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional  capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . industrial designer: So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing  Expert  Anna marketing: industrial designer: and  w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions  for this remote control and I show you the the working design .  we want an on off button , it can be  it's simple but it's it's important , and also  the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , marketing:  . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is  will be to well my aim would be to  design the and choose the chips and the infrared  components to build the remote control marketing: This is very quick  design ,  you stop me or interrupt me if  you don't agree on it on that . industrial designer: And  so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this  schema marketing: Well . industrial designer: that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me marketing: You drew it a long time ago ? industrial designer: you know . industrial designer: And  that's it so I won't go into details about that project manager: overwhelming . So project manager: are they cheap , or are they  reliable ? What were your industrial designer: found and yeah th you have always a compromise with  reliability and  i if it's expensive , project manager:  . industrial designer: but  this one was not this one also really  reliable  so yeah that's it for the working design ,  I hope you get clearer view on  what what a remote control is  in terms of  technical components project manager: Yes . industrial designer: but maybe yeah project manager: So user interface: But is it  can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma industrial designer: No no no no we we will  This is a preference but we can always change  project manager: What I w what I was thinking about  the the the schema  about  the sender and the receiver ,  can you can you get back to it ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah  , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not  able to change it . We will use  infrared protocol  using yeah infrared and  and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists project manager: industrial designer: and but we what we can do is   adapting the the chips inside  to the best  chips and  infrared bubbles . Of course yeah user interface: But you should be careful , industrial designer: in the chip you have it yeah . user interface: people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote    which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . user interface: So maybe we should think of marketing: industrial designer: Of course yeah we should take that into account marketing: That's handy . project manager: Yeah yes marketing: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . industrial designer: in the  user interface: Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away industrial designer: user interface: You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . project manager: I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this  th these things . So  I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , marketing: user interface: so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that  basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have  keys or buttons with which people can  press and then  changing a button will basically  change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and   industrial designer: So p as  Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is  s a question which will we have to see later . user interface: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . user interface: And  so generally  I don't have some figures sorry but  so there are two kinds of  remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play ,  volume change and  keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now   even the one  on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but   . Then there is  this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing ,  which which you can vouch . And then you have  what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop  and then you play the movie or  or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those marketing: And then well personal preferences I would  basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the  the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because  some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that  we could  aim for the like in the f coming future  that type of  applications with marketing: Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , user interface: marketing: so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , user interface: Yeah . marketing: so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: or does it know which one you want to use ? user interface:  actually  you could you could think of  having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing marketing: user interface: but   yo you you you still can't  in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option marketing: user interface: and you could play it or You can also think about having like  I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate  sitting setup box marketing: user interface: and  you have   something like   you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you marketing: user interface: and  you can just you know  when you come back you could just switch on that thing and  watch a program . user interface: In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . user interface: It's the next generation thing , project manager:  yes , user interface: but it is going to come in couple of years . project manager: but I think it's i i it's already there , user interface: It's goi project manager:  the hard disk  recorders  I I've seen them in the shop . user interface: it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both   video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . That's , user interface: No no we are not making a universal remote , marketing: yeah . user interface: we are just looking at  giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box marketing:  . user interface: which is going to sit there and  it's going to do that job for me . Because y project manager: W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . project manager: Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible  future p  prospects marketing:  . So we can always discuss about it for example  the presently the video market actually  this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually industrial designer: user interface: so it i like people are providing like  things like   movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and  your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . user interface: and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . industrial designer: Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed  online  yeah . user interface: Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie marketing:  . project manager: I have  received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and  I would like to share them with you . project manager: first thing is  teletext is a well known feature of televisions marketing: Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent  prominent  place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . project manager:  as  a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . project manager: further yes we must think ,  do we stay  to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back  huh , or do we   go further as Matthew indicated by supporting   recording  devices ? user interface: marketing: So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? project manager:  indeed indeed .  , furthermore , w we need really need to interest  y younger customers and then with younger customers  people  below the age of forty , marketing: project manager: So industrial designer: So project manager: that's to that's  there's a market but  they will grow older older marketing: project manager: and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . project manager:  therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be  have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . user interface: Yeah it's  well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , marketing: user interface: but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys marketing:  . user interface: you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and  basically   so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually industrial designer: But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , user interface: Yeah so . Yes yes marketing: that's the the the  the new and the funky things , project manager: mo industrial designer: Because they are already used to that , you know , product . marketing: that's , project manager: Yes it's recognisable industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . So , for example you have  presently  keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and   four five six like that and  you can have keys like this in form like  keys like that project manager: Mael can you hand me over this  ? industrial designer: Yes . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? project manager:  well marketing: 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all project manager: I think fi five min user interface: Forty minutes ? marketing: and it's a very important issue . too sorry , so we basically don't change the  original order of them industrial designer: user interface: but then the keys are more spacious , marketing: user interface: they don't look  so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three ,  four , sorry four here  five and six , marketing:  . user interface: so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice industrial designer: user interface: but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to project manager: Okay . industrial designer: marketing: basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control user interface: Yeah . marketing: wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? user interface: project manager: Of course they have already one . marketing: 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . I well I think many people said  in your in in your research    the appearance of the  R_C_ is is important when they are buying one marketing:  . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . marketing: In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . project manager: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance marketing: Well , we can't , with the price range . project manager: What do What do you think about What componen industrial designer: Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros  per  per R_ s R_C_ marketing:  . industrial designer: and I think  with this now you know that chips are very  cheaps marketing: If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that industrial designer: that's marketing: which would drive the cost up a lot . industrial designer: Ye project manager: Is the L_C_D_ screen marketing: For universal remotes industrial designer: I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term . project manager: I think thi this could be this could be a market because  universal remote controls  tend to be  quite expensive . marketing: And quite complicated to use , project manager: S so we can try to go in between , marketing: yes . project manager: but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal   R_C_ industrial designer: Universal . project manager: marketing: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . project manager:  yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know . project manager: I think  when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . project manager: So d Do you agree ? user interface: Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is  not too expensive . industrial designer: Yeah user interface:  and it d  Our provin industrial designer: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell  four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers  the price of a chip is  price of a chip is very cheap . industrial designer: So I'm okay for designing  a ne  less yeah a a kind of universal  R_C_ yeah . And  basically you can look to the standards of other industrial designer: Yeah that's needed , yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . marketing: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . user interface: Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . project manager: So given we are going for this   universal type  m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific  user interface content industrial designer: Yes . project manager: and  maybe you can look on on what trends are in this  in this type of market . user interface: and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good marketing: project manager: W yes , user interface: for the project manager: we  we can have lunch now . project manager: So  Then th th the next meeting will  user interface: Yeah so we meet in well what are our project manager: after lunch you have  we have  thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting <doc-sep>Who starts ? project manager: Well I'll  start just with another presentation , so then we can  look at th at the agenda  for this meeting . project manager: Well  in we'll  just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we  thought we had dec decided . Y you also have  received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? industrial designer: No . project manager: Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really  smart  to  to include some things  we can't , because of the new requirements . project manager: We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . So we said that  we have to merge the strong points from our  competitors , and  look at their  remote controls . project manager: We should make it  compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . And  well they can have two functions , because  you have a D_V_D_ and a television . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , user interface: project manager: so it's not quite  But well I have to do it . project manager: The materials  well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and  well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . industrial designer: I I disagree , but  it's not  t it's not my place to disagree I guess . project manager: Well the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ user interface: Oh . project manager: and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project . project manager: So that's a shame , because  especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .  well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have  one remote control for all those technical devices they can  reach it . user interface: project manager: Well and  our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So  we have to  use  maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and  Yeah well  on our remote controls the design has to be  , well as we already said a actually ,  familiar . project manager: So maybe that's a slogan we can put  somewhere on our remote control or something . project manager: Oh you have to start ? I didn't see anything about  who had to start . marketing: I I just have to  to think which file's mine , user interface: marketing: 'cause I was  bit in a hurry .  next sheet ?  at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current  controls , because it's  a smart thing to exclude those things .  They also say , that's about  I thought it was fifty per cent ,  that more money will be spent on  better looking controls . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common  tasks kind of big or kind of  flashy . Thus it might be  might be smart to make a a big  zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your  your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . marketing: 'Cause it's  a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . industrial designer: Oh ? project manager: It should actually  It should actually be loose from the television , user interface: Yeah . So if you deliver a small  click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . marketing: Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ? project manager: No you can click it on your television . marketing: Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? project manager: Yeah in another room , yeah . marketing: Nee but it it specifically says it's  the the control is lost in the same room . marketing: So Well a beeping device would be project manager: Well we'll have a look at it , yeah . So the the learning curve should be very short  for the dumbest people should be able to use it . user interface: industrial designer: I think our  user  expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . industrial designer: users to  add one ? Do you think ? user interface: I don't think marketing: I think you should put more time in the in the design of  pick up and use , than a manual . Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work . industrial designer: Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call  wh when I don't know it ? marketing: Alright . But  the designer should  take it  should  Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote .  , we're Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience .  research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their  zapping  device .  I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of  the people like that . project manager: Well marketing: So it's very important we should definitely have that in our  designs . project manager: Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't  afford an L_C_D_  industrial designer: It's going to be expensive . marketing: So if we want to s If we have a big If we make lots of  of the stuff , maybe we can  buy it very cheap , I dunno . project manager: Yeah well  it's your your task to  look into the costs  of those  industrial designer: We'll think abo we'll think marketing: Yeah , I don't know . project manager: It's not yet a standard  development  those so user interface: No and we have customers in multiple  countries I think . project manager: We sh marketing: Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the project manager: F_ five . industrial designer:  well  I think it's important  for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . industrial designer: And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page . You have  basically  the energy , the power of the of the remote control ,  and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . user interface: industrial designer: And the the user interface sends  the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip  sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . marketing: industrial designer:  well I have   put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps . project manager: industrial designer: The chip  produces Morse code ,  a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send  that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . project manager: industrial designer: Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's  very simple , and signals the  signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , project manager: Yeah . marketing: industrial designer: and the T_V_ set  also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task . project manager: So it is also why we have to have a button that says  I'm now busy with a D_V_D_  if we had done that . And  if we if we're going to add an  an  L_C_D_ screen to it , it  won't look anything like this , but This is very basic  basically the the shape of  of a remote control . It has  very little buttons and user interface: industrial designer: But it it  it's it's quite  Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . So we have to  change a little bit  to that ,  so that  it becomes more user-friendly , and that  problems like  R_S_I_ and  those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . marketing: But I think it's very important to make  the power , channel and volume buttons  near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_  consequences . industrial designer: Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately marketing: Right . project manager: Well but but user interface: You can also like industrial designer: You don't have to look and and search for them . project manager: if you have  the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same  well moves . project manager: But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , user interface: project manager: and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ . marketing: We project manager: No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . And user interface: Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some  little  Gameboy things or some project manager: Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have  those buttons . marketing: But is that is that useable ? user interface:  ? marketing: Do people ,  when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? project manager: user interface: Well marketing: It's a f it's a new feature , project manager: Well it it's industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah alright , but project manager: Well also i if someone puts picks up his  remote user interface: Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it , I think . If someone puts up i  picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . industrial designer: But in e in any case the the basic function should be  indeed , and as you say at the thumb . industrial designer: I think that's a good idea , and  and that the less important  buttons , like the the the different channels ,  the numbers one two three four five as well , should be  yeah well not in reach , because  they don't use it  all the time . industrial designer: And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but  I don't want to get too technical , project manager: Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic  of the of the new marketing: Alright . industrial designer: But I had too too little time , marketing: industrial designer: but  don't  don't look at it please . project manager: Well then we have still the time , so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . project manager: user interface: Well I thought  everybody on the website  would see the same thing , but obviously that's not the case . user interface: The the method ? Well I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look  at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . user interface:  marketing: These are already in use ? user interface: Yes , these are from from another  manufacturer . user interface:  Well , I thought  that we  reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . user interface: So we can can  yeah customise the project manager: Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about  the recognition from our company . user interface: You can marketing: But it project manager: So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then  our recognition is totally gone . marketing: Yeah , that's right user interface: Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . So the symbol's always on user interface: Yeah ? industrial designer: Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah . Something like that , project manager: Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . I think  industrial designer: Mike ,  can you put  that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? user interface: Yeah , I will . project manager: Yeah ? marketing:  there are two target audi audiences , and we've  chose for the younger one . project manager: Well what if we  I at I at home have a remote that has  the most familiar  buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , marketing: project manager: a f a little  You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do . project manager: Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m  a lot , industrial designer: No   usually marketing: Yeah right . industrial designer: But project manager: but not user interface: Yeah , but what kind of features ? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . marketing: You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to  go to the concurrent . project manager: On  some  calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , marketing: Right . project manager: Those kind of things ,  because you also have those  those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . And  well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching . So it it just signals the the different  sig  the different symbols on the screen you have , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer:  because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your  on your L_C_D_ screen . It it could be such a little  th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . user interface: It will industrial designer: But should it  really be  clickable ,  project manager: Well maybe . industrial designer: But that's of course  a bit more  expensive than  the basic  calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing . project manager: Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's  keeps it  rolling , marketing: Well it's just one script . project manager: and it's not  That's five minutes off  implementing time I think  marketing: Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . marketing: Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? project manager:  well I think so , yes . Right , I don't know if I can find that , but project manager: We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that . user interface: Or maybe you will get that information  project manager:  we can use this board again , I think . user interface: At the top or at the bottom ? industrial designer: The L_C_D_ screen alright but we should start with the power button ? marketing: I think the top is more  project manager: Yeah . industrial designer:  user interface: Yeah but marketing: When you s How do you zap ? project manager: marketing: You just sit in your chair ? project manager: industrial designer: Huh ? user interface: Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . industrial designer: And then  marketing: We'll draw two , and then we'll see  industrial designer: Maybe we should  centralise the discussion here . I dunno what  you were talking about but marketing: No industrial designer: we are busy with something . He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top . Why do you think it's better at the bottom ? user interface:  well because most  remotes have  some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . marketing: But your user interface: I c industrial designer: But you just can put  the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface . user interface: Well I d I think that's that's ugly but marketing: The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small . But project manager: Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , user interface: I th industrial designer: And and we can project manager: because  when when  when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . project manager: So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window marketing: Yeah right . marketing: We industrial designer: It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . user interface: Yeah you don't want project manager: We don't want them to look like a calculator . project manager: We want to look it like our original but familiar industrial designer: Yeah w well , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but  you don't have to throw   important aspe important aspect like familiarity  completely away , marketing: High-tech . project manager: Yea industrial designer:  because I think it's  marketing: project manager: Maybe a bic  better  white  We White ? industrial designer: I think it's still important to have it at the top , marketing: Width .  format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ? industrial designer: because it's  it's more familiar that way . Well project manager: Well  let's  talk about that later  industrial designer: Maybe you should another pen . marketing: I think we have  a few functions , and we can put  the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . user interface: At the bottom ? industrial designer: Well I'm the I I'm the designer , so  user interface: In a few minutes marketing: At the bot user interface: Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . project manager: Well but  what what if we we first decide the different functions , user interface: He's the boss . marketing: And moreover I think that you two should be  come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . industrial designer: While you have to agree , I can say it's like this and you must agree . project manager: We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons user interface: The ten numbers ? Yeah ? industrial designer: Channel , yeah . user interface: I think we we should use something like this  to  The the channel up and channel down button ? Yeah , in circle , you know ? project manager: Yes . project manager: Well h ho industrial designer: But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . They are for some  video  user interface: Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons . When when you  put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , project manager: marketing: and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . industrial designer: Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . project manager: That's what I always do , industrial designer: Y project manager: because all my i important buttons are the same place . project manager: Yes ? user interface: Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . industrial designer: No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle ? marketing: Frequency of  button use . marketing: So the the channel  channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . project manager: Up and down far apart from each other ? industrial designer: Far apart ? marketing: You thinking  about R_S_I_ ? user interface: Yeah but project manager: Well not too much . industrial designer: marketing: Nei not too much , but user interface: The other the other two  frustrations are far more important . So industrial designer: I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have  have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . project manager: Well for example the power button , you can user interface: Well they are used four times an hour , so project manager: If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . project manager: The power button can  be   user interface: Power bu button should be left at the top . marketing: The most important things we have to  project manager:  how are we going to do it with those numbers ? industrial designer: C c can you make you make We can use  the drawing board now , I think .  it it doesn't work well but But it it would be pretty pretty  nice if we could just draw a simple thing . project manager: Well user interface: Well consensus ,  We we can put it in the middle , so project manager: Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be  individually . We're No project manager: That's a bit  marketing: We're deciding now , so project manager: Yes . marketing: Top or bottom ? industrial designer: Well  yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to  to have it at the top , so project manager: Yes it is . You say familiarity isn't important but project manager: Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? marketing: Okay . industrial designer: As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . Are we going to  do it like  on Mike's screen with  one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? user interface: No . project manager: How do you want it to do then ? user interface: Well just when you push a one one and industrial designer: There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . user interface: No , if you On most T_V_s if you  press two numbers shortly after each other , d it industrial designer: Oh , like that . project manager: Okay  anyone any  oth other functionalities of our  remote ? industrial designer: I think these are the the most important functions . You do need them ? project manager: No , we'd  just said we didn't  marketing: Yeah , I know . project manager:  well because we can't integrate it with any other  remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are  irrelevant . marketing: project manager: We'll have  those  buttons about  And  the two important ones we're l f forgetting . project manager: Those two ? But it's just two , and we make a clip ? industrial designer:  just two just two under  under  marketing: project manager: Th that's a bit  waste . industrial designer: I I think  project manager: Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . user interface: Or at industrial designer: But you you can put  two or three buttons under  another section . industrial designer: You can just put it somewhere project manager: Yeah industrial designer: They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere user interface: Oh , they can be small or round like buttons . What do you think  those those buttons ? project manager: Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . Well any other  marketing: Well if you you take those th If you user interface: Why go to video ? project manager: Go to video , that's always on your remote control . marketing: Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to  industrial designer: The the video channel  ? user interface: That's just zero . user interface: Yeah , but you can can zap down marketing: Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ . user interface: I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but project manager: Th that's the button  No . industrial designer: But it's easy to go If you are at  at channel  fifty five and you want to  go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . project manager: I I think that one button is  I use it  user interface: marketing: Yeah , but if we're choosing to  incorporate these buttons , you have to have  channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . project manager: Yeah ? marketing: Right all th these  different buttons you have to project manager: These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting  especially on my remote . project manager: It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down ,  those user interface: Yeah well y you must have . user interface: Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , project manager: user interface: and then with plus and min minus you can  adjust the  marketing: Right . project manager: Ch ch industrial designer: Yeah to  oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah . Oh the Okay button ? marketing:  project manager: Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . project manager: user interface: I think things like  contrast and brightness should be  in the menu , yeah . project manager: We're going to  go to our  rooms , and  we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . project manager: Well see you  user interface: I thought we'd  lunch  right now , or not ? project manager: W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now  so  industrial designer: Yeah this is this is your thing <doc-sep>marketing: Where are are all the other presentations ? industrial designer: I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be marketing: The conceptual or industrial designer: yeah I think so . Because I see only my own presentation user interface: industrial designer: No no no , can you go back one ? marketing: yeah . industrial designer:  'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that's it . industrial designer: 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the user interface: marketing: Ah , project manager: Ah . marketing: I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but project manager: You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . industrial designer: Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it .  we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to  f the remote control has to support . project manager: Yes ? industrial designer: Who wants to start ? marketing: Me first again or project manager: Yeah sure . So  the developments I will address them project manager: marketing: oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours .  Well the first aspect  was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . user interface: marketing:  nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours user interface: Yeah . Yeah you're just the user interface  ? user interface: It's better than than my  drawing . And I used  possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design .  I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you  what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking  type . If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours  , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not  solid straight lines anymore . user interface: project manager: industrial designer: There's a lot of options that we have to discuss .  we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . industrial designer:  the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . project manager: industrial designer: Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the project manager: marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know .  I wasn't able to finish my  personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . industrial designer: Well we have all kinds of hard  materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium .  we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . industrial designer: Electronics ? Yeah , maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement  for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . I first  chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . user interface: Or combine  both with a with one  project manager:  I think you can only fit one  source of energy on the industrial designer: Yeah maybe we marketing: I guess we can only choose one . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . I always chuck my  remote control around , so marketing: Yeah , just playing with it project manager: Yeah . It can be done , you can't harm it , project manager: S yeah it's safe . industrial designer: You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . marketing: So double curved is like this , this , this , or industrial designer: No it means curved in two dimensions . So  w single curved ?  let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . So  Yeah  yeah that's one thing  which I'm not sure  of how to implement it  into the remote control . project manager: Well the visual representation is not there with speech industrial designer: Design ? user interface: No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu  for functions and project manager: but you can Yeah . user interface: But do  j do we  do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? project manager: Both . Everybody says it so that's what's  yeah  Yeah in the in the last  meeting we  we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . And only the the L_C_D_ panel will  light up and then you can only  change the yeah the options . project manager: user interface: you have to  delete this but this is the the the simple  layout . user interface:  display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . project manager: You did read the minutes I wrote ? user interface:  project manager: You did read the minutes I wrote ? user interface: What ? A little bit I think but not not everything w industrial designer: I project manager: Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . user interface: But But this is the the basic  design  for the for the m yeah for the buttons . And  if there are older people they wanted more  yeah more  luxurous so that's an a also an option . Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ?  energy source , chip type , case type . industrial designer: Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and  and f audio function . industrial designer: I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , marketing: Kinetic . industrial designer: to be able to m project manager:  I didn't get any info on this . industrial designer: That's gonna be difficult huh ? marketing: The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? project manager: I have total here . project manager: Yeah the interface , maybe can user interface:  it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options  yeah .  do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . marketing: If you go to your homepage or something , you should industrial designer: Yeah I'm going there now . marketing: I got my fresh and fyoo fruity  picture  also  over there , so project manager: Ah you didn't draw it yourself . industrial designer: S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form  yeah serves the function , you know . industrial designer: where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And user interface: But it has also to it it has also to be  luxurous  for for yeah rich people . industrial designer: Yeah but that's that's the the problem  yeah the dilemma actually , project manager: Distinction . industrial designer: 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . industrial designer: Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , user interface: The colour Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it  make the colours with LEDs  beneath the the buttons . user interface: If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . industrial designer: To customise it and so  kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and people who want something , you know , different , or more  design , they can go for one colour project manager: Different . marketing: industrial designer: Just give me the thing that it's inside there project manager: Yeah but this this the is for the . industrial designer: A compromise between what ? project manager:  instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . marketing: Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? project manager: Yeah that would be an option . industrial designer: And I I'm I'm thinking  you know  a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . user interface: Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . user interface: If you have  it have it in your hand , you you you are not only  yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . Something to shoot at your television industrial designer: Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , project manager: industrial designer: That would be a nice way to use it but  , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think . marketing: Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have project manager: To switch from buttons to interface  . industrial designer: How about marketing: Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but industrial designer: Yeah I understand what you mean . marketing: That's  that's industrial designer: How about we do a  a pop-up screen , like the laptop . marketing: Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or industrial designer: And then if you want project manager:  so you have a the the side view . marketing:  maybe it's too much project manager: make this industrial designer: No  like project manager: . industrial designer: Yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . user interface: But you you want industrial designer: F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? user interface: okay . industrial designer: So w w project manager: No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . project manager: and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto   automatically . Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your user interface: That's but it's it's not industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . marketing: An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of  thin rubber layer or something like that . industrial designer: That actually will offer some extra protection for the project manager: Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . project manager: What kind of industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th project manager: Harder . marketing: Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there . project manager: industrial designer: That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f user interface: But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem . user interface: But that's that's very expensive  industrial designer: Like like you drew here . user interface: We we could make some some rubber  some rubber  yeah mouse , with which you can change  industrial designer:  project manager: Oh yeah . marketing: we have to make industrial designer: Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape . marketing: Yeah we we better so choose one industrial designer: And also the screen , you cannot mould it . marketing: But that's the kind of the idea , industrial designer: And then you can marketing: so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , industrial designer: You can place the screen here , which can come . marketing: yeah , you can use the button option project manager: So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? industrial designer: And but then I w I would marketing: Spongey . marketing: Spongey can be reached by means of industrial designer: Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here , user interface: . And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ? industrial designer: I  y eah that's what  . industrial designer: or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? user interface: industrial designer: I dunno . project manager: Yeah that's user interface: marketing:  bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so it's better to have  some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary  colours . industrial designer: Yeah we could make marketing: I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? Like some soft green or something ? project manager: Orange or something . marketing: Or and then user interface: Or blue ? Dark blue or marketing: Oh yeah yeah , dark blue industrial designer: We should use marketing: and then and then very bright ,  a yellow banana , an orange ,  a green apple , stuff like that , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah but the primary colours w we can  create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . If you make it  just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , project manager: user interface: also for the for the more  yeah for the people . project manager: Y marketing: So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . industrial designer: Like you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones , marketing: industrial designer: the you know that 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that  people lose their  remote controls often . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: So it not not only in in the colours of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or marketing: How do you mean ? project manager: Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . project manager: Well I think it's a bit too much but user interface: Maybe a industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is  pretty high . user interface: And which which colour should  should I give the the display ?  project manager: Who ? user interface: Or marketing: the the colour of the background of the display ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty  sixty six five thousand  colour , so yeah too expensive . J industrial designer: As long as you loo use  high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . user interface: maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? industrial designer: So that people with  with marketing: White backlight , and dark . Or is it  too expensive ? marketing: But maybe  they have to they have to have some colour right ? project manager: It's difficult . industrial designer: But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? project manager: Yeah you can industrial designer: Like the pictures I showed you guys . user interface: It's it's not industrial designer: The green ? project manager: Why ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? project manager: They have LEDs but they have a colour . marketing: How do you mean ? project manager:  they they don't determine the colour that much , I think . Yeah I I was think about a red  red LEDs and blue LEDs and project manager: 'Cause you have to print on them you have a background marketing: No that's that's too busy I guess . project manager: So you can't change the colour so marketing: You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . industrial designer: what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with  one coloured LED behind it . industrial designer: as the colour the And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , marketing: industrial designer: but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . project manager: Okay with  Don't mean to discourage you but  basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . project manager: Yeah  about user interface: marketing: So wh how should I do that ? project manager: Yeah I don't know . marketing: because you are going to design it on this board right ? project manager: Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . industrial designer: So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? industrial designer: Alright . user interface: Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So if you'll rather draw in paint or something industrial designer: Current colour ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah 'cause I have to  focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . And you have to think  how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . industrial designer: So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . industrial designer: so we kind of want the girlish marketing: project manager: That's included . Excuse me ? marketing: Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't  , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable . industrial designer: How do we   marketing: Erase ? industrial designer: or insert text ? project manager: I dunno . industrial designer:  I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather  a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your project manager: Jesus . industrial designer: 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and user interface: The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . marketing: I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but industrial designer: Exactly but the  but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . user interface: Yeah the display , industrial designer:  don't you think ? user interface: we yeah we can put a display . industrial designer: So the display we will put in here , the basic  functions in here , where it's most reachable . user interface: industrial designer: What do don't have to draw it exactly do we ? user interface: No it's it's  it's okay . industrial designer: So this is gonna be from the marketing: I is it if if this is from the side industrial designer:  from user interface: From the marketing: woah . marketing: So then it's like this , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ? user interface: Yeah I'm I'm industrial designer: The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . user interface: May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . user interface: Because here marketing: It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . user interface: But why why do we need  the flipping  industrial designer: you can adjust the angle to which it flips . industrial designer: Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that user interface: marketing: user interface: Yeah . marketing: user interface:  the the shape is okay but yeah ? I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping  mechanism . It's it's for for for more trendy  marketing: Yeah but maybe Yeah but maybe we we should then user interface: Because we have enough space . marketing: Yeah there the middle Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? user interface: Yeah and then h we sh  . user interface: marketing: Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . user interface: Yeah , then it's marketing: So there's a layer of rubber on the side . project manager: marketing: So no flipping but just user interface: No flipping or project manager: No flipping ? marketing: no . user interface: you wanted the flipping so industrial designer: Yeah I guess but   most votes count right ? user interface: But if you if you If you drop it it it just breaks . user interface: And it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . user interface: But there are more marketing:  they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their  remote  control . user interface: Okay wi industrial designer: Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . project manager: I don't see any power cables here so industrial designer: Let's see . But do we want  options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah I'm just thinking , if we i we wanna make something different project manager: industrial designer: right ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons "

        "Summary": "The marketing team suggested that the remote control should have only one button and be compatible with Windows media center, allowing it to operate multiple devices simultaneously. However, the industrial designer disagreed, stating that additional buttons, such as play, fast forward, and stop, would be necessary for a video player. The industrial designer also proposed using titanium for a tough and stylish cover, appealing to older customers. They emphasized the importance of using real titanium instead of titanium-like plastic or compromising the LCD screen. The industrial designer also raised questions about the remote control's universality and programmability, suggesting the need for different modes to send out signals. They also considered the size of the remote, given the complexity of integrating various technical parts. Ultimately, the industrial designer proposed an integrated material approach to reduce costs.",
        "Article": "project manager: Then  I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it , marketing: Yeah . marketing: project manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this  design . project manager: Well the finance  we'll do later , so  firstly  I'll show you the notes . project manager: Well  user interface: marketing: project manager: We ge we went through the agenda , industrial designer: project manager: and well we had some  some presentations from you three . marketing: industrial designer:  it's pretty  much  like  Mike draw  drew  the in the during the last meeting . industrial designer: and later we'll put out  more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under  the under side  of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . industrial designer:  which is  made  which is also part of the back , part of the titanium  titanium part . user interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but industrial designer: Yeah ? user interface: It's a double R_ . industrial designer:   it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_  logo is in there .  it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different  channel buttons . And then we have the m The m user interface: Channel up and volume ? industrial designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls  in the middle here .   with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or    square buttons . Oh nei we  the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and  volume  changers . project manager: Well if I look at it , the side the side view user interface: Well , at the back industrial designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first  our talk user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Maybe I I don't want to I don't want to suppress you but n I'll  finish this  quick . project manager: industrial designer:  okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? user interface: No the back . user interface: No I don't think And the industrial designer: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape  above the logo . industrial designer: and project manager: W user interface: And about the side view  This the front won't be as thick , industrial designer: user interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really  project manager: Well I see , but industrial designer: Oh and  before I forget . industrial designer: And you can record it  using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . marketing: project manager: When I look at  when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible .  ? project manager: If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But industrial designer: Why ? Well it fits  it it it it fits the hand , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: mean  the the the the project manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when  when  you have such of  an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . user interface: If y If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this . H What do you suggest  we do ? This was Mike's prototype , project manager: Well  marketing: industrial designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it . project manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet ,  ? industrial designer: But now you have a totally different . industrial designer: The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w  project manager: They the the the the the side view , industrial designer: Side ?  oh the side ? project manager: we didn't  industrial designer: W we we he drew the s the side , user interface: Yeah yeah . user interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it , industrial designer: You're not holding it like this or something . user interface: you you industrial designer: You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah . user interface: industrial designer: You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way . industrial designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , marketing: Yeah , I agree on this . That's not  the point user interface: No but but industrial designer: Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen  of course on the upper side , but user interface: Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree project manager: Yeah well user interface: and only Nils project manager:  I think  if you t if you three  agree then then that's it . industrial designer: But  are d Can you live with it ?  project manager: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should user interface: Yeah ? industrial designer: Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally  unusable . project manager: No No , industrial designer: But do you project manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But In the market  industrial designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . industrial designer: Not totally , well project manager: For me , I I wouldn't buy it . project manager: Yeah , we don't know , industrial designer: Maybe a thousand people , project manager: but that's  that's that's that's more market research . user interface: industrial designer:  any other suggestions ? project manager: No , I think it's great . You can do the evaluation  criteria on this ? user interface: industrial designer: You're very personal again . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of   the impor most important requirements and trends . marketing: I  think you have all seen  this kind of evaluation , so  I don't have to explain it .  the first question is ,  is the device good-looking ? Because normal p  most people thought that  earlier devices were ugly ugly . So what do we think ? industrial designer: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very user interface:  . project manager: To the customers ? industrial designer: So and we ha we have answer now ? project manager: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? industrial designer: Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so industrial designer: I Yeah , I think it marketing: Yeah , but  , you know We dis we di we designed it to be perfect . Easy to find t industrial designer: Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one .  is it good-looking ? industrial designer: Well , I guess  I think  it's  it's it's  pointed towards the youth of course ,  if you look at the design and and the colours and everything .  it's it's not f a device that marketing: The titanium might be  f for older people . industrial designer: Yeah , that's that's  for older people , it's it's more that classical look . I think Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll  they they think  the the titanium look of it is also  I think it's also good for them , so I think we both  have  consider considered  the youth and also a bit older people . user interface: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but  project manager: No . user interface: no it's  marketing: Easy to change channels ? project manager: No , not false . industrial designer: D we d we don't we don't have  that s user interface: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , project manager: Well six then . industrial designer: Well we don't have the device that beeps  when you lost it or so , project manager: Are the functions easy to learn ? industrial designer: but   project manager: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an user interface: We have so few functions , so Yeah . project manager: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ? user interface: Well , I should I think two , project manager: Yeah . Two ? industrial designer:  ? project manager: Yeah , but just do some We we marketing: Yeah project manager: I th I th I think this is too time consuming . industrial designer: Are we take too much time ? project manager:  not not towards you , marketing: Yeah , I agree . marketing: Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? R_S_I_ sensitive ? project manager:  well well a bit , so four . project manager: Is the device easy to use ? user interface: The project manager: Yes we have not many buttons . project manager: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? user interface: T industrial designer: F project manager: Well in our covers , in our fronts . industrial designer: Four ? marketing: If you look at this industrial designer: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit ,  that's true . project manager: industrial designer: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . user interface: This is the last meeting ? project manager: Yes , but we we have to design much more , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: The what ? project manager: The sample speaker , industrial designer: The marketing: Out . marketing: Batteries are  quite project manager: L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on , marketing:  no , no no no . user interface: Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ? industrial designer: Because  project manager: Well be for the L_C_D_  you had said . user interface: Why not ? industrial designer: Because  that  y project manager: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ? industrial designer: because my information says it . project manager: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? industrial designer: Huh ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: And simple ? industrial designer:  well yeah I I read something about it , but user interface: Simple . So Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen . user interface: We we we Why ? project manager: user interface: We have very little options furthermore , for the project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen .  project manager: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , marketing: No project manager: because the the fronts they will buy it . industrial designer:  it d it doesn't marketing: No , that's n It's not relevant . marketing: No , Then the whole concept is  industrial designer: Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . user interface: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print , industrial designer: user interface: and we have an L_C_ display . industrial designer: Well  and what do they mean with curves  again ? Because we you have uncurved project manager: Well I I did single curve to Well you said s double curved , user interface: I ? project manager:  he , user interface: ? project manager: because  I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . industrial designer: Well marketing: No industrial designer: But what what did what do n marketing: no no no . project manager: But industrial designer: Sorry , but What do they mean with the curves ? project manager: Curved ? industrial designer: Is th Is this a curve ? project manager: Yes , that's curved . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to  congratulate us , so  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . industrial designer: But  I user interface: Yeah or we could replace it marketing: If you if you make it cool to have project manager: By the way , we also have this one . industrial designer: Hey but  I think you'll agree that  that we that now we have this  screen , it's it's very  not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . marketing: industrial designer: Well that's pretty  l user interface: Why why don't we replace the titanium with  plastic coloured titanium , marketing: That is pretty stupid . Well user interface:  titanium-coloured plastic ? project manager: Who ? marketing: project manager: You want to dump the titanium ? user interface: Yeah well if we  we we have to get cheaper . industrial designer: I think project manager: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . industrial designer: I think the titanium just  provided the the tough look and the and the marketing: Y project manager: Yes . project manager: and th that it is strong , and industrial designer: And also the the older people will like it because of that . industrial designer: Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's  important for old people . project manager: We still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , industrial designer: Yeah . But I think you could better change  titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . project manager: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . project manager: Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But user interface: industrial designer: Yeah this is good , marketing: Osl industrial designer: but it it's not good enough . project manager: Ah those those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? user interface: Well project manager: Come on . user interface: industrial designer: What do we Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So marketing: So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . industrial designer: And on plastic times two and then we  are there ? project manager: Well , no it's just  all plastic . W marketing: project manager: What do we want , guys ? industrial designer: I want gold plating . user interface: Because you y have that curve industrial designer: We have we have to  fill user interface: and you have that curve . project manager: Finance ? user interface: this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it . project manager: Well , guys ? industrial designer: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve  twelve and a half . project manager: Guys ? user interface: project manager: We have to dump our titanium , marketing: Shoot . project manager: and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of  project , user interface: industrial designer: Objection . Well , satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ? industrial designer: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but  marketing: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: I think it's  Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . user interface: project manager: I think it's terrible that we got  those costs at the last moment . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason , industrial designer: Its it's  ridiculous actually , but user interface: And  unrealistic . We had  nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity . project manager: I al I I've  filled that in in a the questionnaires  each time , so user interface: marketing: Yeah yeah . user interface: project manager: But o alright , the teamwork ? industrial designer: Well  they they didn't think of the requirements . project manager: No they said , oh we won't d  we won't  use teletext ,  we won't use the D_V_D_ . project manager:  well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? industrial designer: It was a complete disaster . Yeah ? industrial designer: No  it it it  it is  project manager: Well user interface: No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen . marketing: This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ? project manager: Well it's both a SMARTboard . marketing: You u you use the project manager: It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw . But project manager: Well , wi w which one did you like ? user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Well I didn't use  marketing: Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the these th project manager: We're now talking about the SMARTboards . user interface: Well we we used that one , industrial designer: Nei It it's much m user interface: and we needed it . user interface: Yeah alright , but project manager: Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an I I like it . project manager: And  the digi the digital pen ? Did  did you like that one ? industrial designer: I I didn't use it . project manager: I used it  just to check it out , but  industrial designer: That's the marketing: Yeah . project manager: You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself , user interface: marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into project manager: It's , no , it it's useless . industrial designer:   you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper project manager: But marketing: Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . industrial designer: If you've If you've project manager: But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict  you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . So if you  were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: So it doesn't d doesn't have any marketing: Yeah , right . industrial designer: But I think  d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . industrial designer: Well did you really  Did you really take  take those in account ? I half of time I didn't notice they were there . project manager: Well w why not ?  etcetera We industrial designer: project manager: N new ideas found ? industrial designer: Right . user interface: project manager: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule What ? For future  meetings you have got ? industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Well I missed  the option to  to email , marketing: Communicate in between . project manager: But  two t But  th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to  buy those expensive huge expensive  things , I and I have to w pay those  papers  that are expensive , I'm not going to  user interface: industrial designer: Well No marketing: For people who  sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful . project manager: Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop . industrial designer: But it's still an expensive  expensive project manager: Because this is huge marketing: Well project manager:  this v very very  expensive paper . user interface: Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand . industrial designer: Well and if marketing: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching . industrial designer: And but what if  maybe this this board  SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what  would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? A project manager: Well no . industrial designer: Really ? marketing: Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , yeah , very precise industrial designer: Anything you want . project manager: Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive  towards a a just a green  school board . industrial designer: Well it isn't , but maybe that thing is  is marketing: Yeah , mu industrial designer: Yeah , board , a school board , yeah . user interface: Yeah , but but then you can  save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and  industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: industrial designer: This  if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning . project manager: industrial designer: So  if we get in  if we get another one and you make sure it does work , project manager: Yep . project manager: Se user interface: Yeah , we can go to the bar and  with our newly earned money . But  industrial designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something ? marketing: industrial designer: Well dunno . project manager: Well yeah , it is a bit  Well we still have to make the end report and  all those things . project manager: I Di did you  save this one in the folder ? marketing: You better get started . industrial designer: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and  user interface: My big bird . project manager: marketing: project manager: Where is this ? marketing: industrial designer: Maybe the pen is just   broken and the board isn't . user interface: industrial designer: Who is she you're talking about ? project manager: She already knows . industrial designer: Because then we have to confront her with our user interface: So she can see we're ready . project manager: I'm going to resign after this project anyway , so marketing: Oh , that's just great <doc-sep>See , shall we wait ? I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever , so I'm gonna start soon , we have now don't have much time anyway . project manager: have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , so I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share , so if you wanna review them , they're there . I will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there .  after that I got some new project requirements from project board , so we're gonna go af go after over this later . marketing:  there was a little problem with my computer so not  the whole  presentation  project manager: Anyway , let's see what you have . The the method we used  it it's not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use  ,  we tested it w  with  a hundred  men , and we asked them to w  what the remote  f feel  like and  what what's  important .  project manager: If I can cut in , is it people or men ? marketing: People , project manager: Is it people , okay . project manager: 'Cause I thought it was only men , marketing: Both women and men , project manager: so marketing: yeah . marketing: Yeah , and yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do  a l a little  nice things with it , and  they use yeah , they use zap a lot ,   fifty percent say they only So that's the most important things . marketing:  oh yeah , not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation , project manager: Okay , just talk ahead . marketing:   they use it , but it's not  very  important  on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half  project manager: Okay , that's okay . user interface: marketing: and but not important is the channel selection , the the  ? project manager: That's a little weird . marketing: Oh , user interface: Which channel selection ? marketing: the the no no no no no , that's very important , but  w and not important in the audio settings , display settings project manager: Okay , marketing: and  project manager: we can we can hide those under a menu or something , user interface: Oh , okay .    beep to find your control , was project manager: That's like a button on your T_V_ ? marketing: that was in the test , the the most people  f find it  irritating  when they cannot find a rem their remote control , project manager: Remote , okay . marketing: so  I think it's a bee beep to sound it and  you can find it . And another thing  they want was  speech recognition  so they can say  what they want to let's go to channel one and  that's  kind of things . marketing: And they want maybe an  L_C_D_ screen  to to look it  wh what's on every channel  and  what do I want with it ? user interface: project manager: We wanna have a little preview on the remote control .   my personal preferences is  a button for my favourite channel , so I can  I dunno , so I can zap to my  f  quick  to my favourite channel wh what I  so , the remote mu must see or  must  see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , project manager: Okay , you don't set it yourself , marketing: so I can zap t to project manager: it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . marketing: What ? project manager: You want the you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f marketing: Yeah . project manager: Let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , marketing: Recognise project manager: so it recognises your favourite channel . project manager: Okay , so it's it it does it recognise itself , you don't have to set it marketing: No , project manager: Okay . marketing: the computer  crashed , project manager: No problem , it's it's okay , marketing: so . user interface: It sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . Where is the remote control ? We've all had it once , I want to watch some television , marketing: Yeah . user interface: where's the remote control ? That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , marketing: Yeah . user interface: There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you don't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find  something for that , project manager: Okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that , project manager: Okay , so the buttons should be user interface: so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on  the remote control . user interface: So this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound ,  so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little  investigation to see whether some symbols are  need to be replaced by others . So what we want to go to is not this one , project manager: Yeah , it's true . user interface: This is not the final design , project manager: No , of course  user interface: this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see  basically the general idea . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing , user interface: Yeah , I think it's a really good idea . project manager: The other aspects , we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget .  if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need  something like a mode that you can switch it . industrial designer: And  how big is the remote control  going to be ? I'll tell you why that's important to me .  there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so   that's why I also would like to say  go a little bit easy on the designs ,  I heard ab  you talking about beeps and about  video screens , but  the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . industrial designer: So keep in mind that everything that you keep  think of , it has to b to be built .  that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . industrial designer: Exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . project manager: So you have industrial designer: This is what look like  looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . The switch    if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . You have infrared and an interv   how to say it ?  a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning . industrial designer:  here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote  universal , then the processor has to  make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not .  I don't have any personal p  preferences  so far , except for  the materials to be used  light , that they are light . Like you said  teletext is not not very popular anymore because the  the internet , nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either Well , I don't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it . project manager: But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example .  we're targeting young people now , because our  This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , marketing:  . project manager: that's also good with the fashion and everything , marketing: B project manager: so yeah . marketing: Yeah , and they want to pay for it project manager: They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a  remote that they like . marketing: and  project manager: If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend  spend money on it . marketing: in the project manager: see how far we can go with it anyway , so marketing: Yeah . project manager: And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , but I'm not sure if we I think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can  have a lot of  fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste . So With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your user interface: Oh . project manager:  those cost hardly anything I think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover industrial designer: Yeah . That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . project manager: So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . project manager: just I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . industrial designer: But marketing: But oh ? user interface: Is it manageable ? Is it easy ? industrial designer: Go ahead . marketing: Yeah , with with an L_C_D_ screen you can project manager: Oh yeah . I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , industrial designer: Y Yes , I think so too . I think for example it's it's huge I think the L_C_D_ is huge , user interface: Yeah . user interface: And it costs too much to fabricate , project manager: It costs a lot , I think . industrial designer: Okay ,  project manager: What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , marketing: Okay . project manager: just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing industrial designer: I have to check that out , project manager: but maybe okay , make it industrial designer: I'm not sure . project manager: Yeah , find a little compromise in that , but What did I write down ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_ industrial designer: That must be possible . user interface: And it's industrial designer: whe where do you wanna hit the T_ you wanna we want a button on the television . project manager: I thin Yeah ,  where else should you put it ? industrial designer: In th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control . project manager: but how are you gonna use that if your  if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ? industrial designer:  . user interface: Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . project manager: A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay . industrial designer: Okay , then  I'd I'd like to know now if we want the  universal remote control or not , because that's  determines everything I'm gonna do . I think we should go for universal , industrial designer: If not project manager: because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . marketing: Everyone  wants to buy it , so we w project manager: Yeah , I think we're targeting everyone , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: And it's marketing: Or when you say one two  i it  it's enough , project manager: Yeah , but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two  whatever . user interface: Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that is a problem in implementing this . project manager: It's not a mature technology , I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , marketing: Okay . project manager: so user interface: It's a good idea , but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet . project manager: maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are  the popular buttons , so those always fade first . industrial designer: If we  make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make  a cover for every language area . project manager: For example ? industrial designer: That's fo is  especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . project manager: Well , we're not we're not targeting older people , marketing: Yeah . project manager: You assume that that they read correctly and I think they're industrial designer: Huh . project manager: The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , marketing: But b project manager: so industrial designer:  okay . user interface: But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the project manager: No , of course . No , I think it's just something you you put over them , because Yeah we c Yeah , you ca Well , industrial designer:  . project manager: tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even user interface: C marketing: But every user interface: that's a problem with the with the text then .  , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue you could user interface: industrial designer:  . project manager: For example , if your buttons are faded , after  if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . industrial designer:  but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on  one sleeve , project manager: industrial designer: It works the same as a Nokia telephone , it's it's in my  'kay . project manager: Yeah , I know , it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , marketing: Yeah . Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , I'm not sure which which is easier , industrial designer:  . project manager: so  anyway , yeah , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we let's see we So you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . I want some you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , marketing: Yeah . project manager: because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with .  for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , industrial designer: project manager: and I'm total T_V_ new , anyway . So I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the  the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and  give it a just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can  select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ . user interface: Is it techni technically possible to  send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: because we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ? project manager: That is true . user interface: It's an in-built menu , industrial designer: and if it doesn't know how , it's user interface: isn't it ? Yes . user interface: So basically project manager: I'm not sure if it's impossible , user interface: we project manager: but  there's a chance it's not , so . user interface: Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions project manager: A double-sided remote control ? user interface: you project manager: I don't think that's useful . I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues , project manager: Yeah , but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . user interface: because project manager: For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_ . project manager: I don't think we should user interface: Because if we use a universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it , project manager: Yeah , for exam user interface: so project manager: I'm not s marketing:  yeah . project manager: yeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not not the very complicated settings industrial designer:  . project manager: that you can usually do that with  either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , industrial designer:  . project manager: but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . project manager: I think there's I think there is a standard for example between  industrial designer:  . 'Cause everybody I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so I think industrial designer:  . project manager: I'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then  you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . project manager:  we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , just the way how to . project manager: Yeah , then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay . For instance  Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , project manager: industrial designer: and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else , industrial designer: We should not do that . project manager: So  user interface: I'll put some on paper and present them next time  the ideas that I have . project manager: because we have forty minutes , I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so . project manager: So anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example .  what do you want , do you want , but user interface: Yeah , but we like some some curves or project manager: Yeah , may maybe something like this . Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here . user interface: Yeah , and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume project manager: Think it's like this . So you have the up channel the down channel the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? project manager: Do you take triangles or marketing:  it's it's fine , I think . project manager:  I think it should be I think it user interface: This is basically what people are accustomed to , project manager: Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . industrial designer: Perhaps we should also make  something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . project manager: Yeah , but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash . Yeah , it's true , but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost . user interface: We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . marketing: Just a light on it or user interface: So we have the basic channels we've got here ,  the power button somewhere over here ? project manager: Oh yeah , it's true . project manager: You shouldn't be you  shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere . marketing: And user interface: What would you like to ? project manager: Yeah , I thought maybe we should move the buttons down marketing: But you r project manager: and put it here for example marketing: And you are reading from the t project manager: to marketing: you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . Yeah , that's true , marketing: Yeah , project manager: you should marketing: so it's project manager: I think the bu the power button should be on top , industrial designer:  . user interface: Is that used often ? marketing: So i it's user interface: The mute button ? Do people use that often ? marketing: sorry ? project manager: Mute . user interface: 'Cause  I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general , marketing:  . user interface: but project manager: I don't think it's important , but I think it I think it should be you c user interface: It's not that important , no . project manager: No , because it Yeah , people are accustomed to that , marketing: Around  not  not at top at the around the volume selection . marketing: I don't know where exactly , project manager: Take this out and here see marketing: but project manager:  are we gonna take triangles anyway ? I'm drawing triangles , but marketing: user interface: That's pretty much what people are accustomed to , project manager: Yeah , user interface: aren't they ? project manager: it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . So anyway , I think this is should be the channels and or sh user interface: Well , marketing: Wha user interface: I'm accustomed to the channels being on top . industrial designer: Shall we  also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every project manager: Well , marketing: Yeah . project manager: for that is it's on one part it's  it's a good thing to recharge it marketing: Maybe it's more ex expensive . project manager: Maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . project manager: You have just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying . user interface: But isn't that expensive in the entire package ? industrial designer: But that's already possible . project manager: I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . Because if it's it's  useful to have it rechargeable , user interface: project manager: but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour .  you could make a device , but I'm not sure how that  is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , project manager: I think I have a nice idea . industrial designer: You can  put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . project manager: I think it's  it's a pretty good idea to have  like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . industrial designer: So but marketing: Yeah , that's g industrial designer: But I think that will cost a lot . project manager: A what ? industrial designer: Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can  just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , project manager: Well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal industrial designer: you don't need basic station . marketing: But Which project manager: It's a very small Yeah , I'm drawing it big now , but So you can put your remote on flat for example . user interface: 'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station industrial designer: project manager: I'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that's what he r industrial designer:  . I'm not sure if there's information available on this , project manager: It's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible . industrial designer: but marketing: But user interface: And do people actually want that ? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? marketing: Yeah , they want to pay for it . project manager: I'm not sure , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important . marketing: But project manager: They want to pay for comfort , industrial designer: Well , this is comfort . project manager: we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , marketing: But f  . project manager:  and Yeah , we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . marketing: project manager: So  marketing: project manager: let's go through the industrial designer: I like the covers . So user interface: marketing: project manager: what we have is you have I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost . industrial designer: I hope if I have information about that , project manager: Maybe yeah , industrial designer: I'm gonna project manager: or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . project manager: We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , okay . project manager: but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , marketing: Yeah yeah yeah . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can  choose what we want in it project manager: Yeah , if you have some financial information that that'd be nice , industrial designer: and exactly , I need it . user interface: Could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it project manager: marketing: Yeah . user interface: You seem to have information on that , I'd like to  see some of it . industrial designer: Was it not possible to  send emails around the office ? project manager: No , it wasn't wasn't allo user interface: No , it's not . So that's  why I'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft .  marketing: but I have the  user interface: Well , I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that . marketing: Yeah , but I Here I have the the s the homepage of  our internet , user interface: Let's see . project manager: Yeah , the oh , they inc  marketing: and here is my project manager: they include the new one . user interface: Oh , where would we marketing: here is my marketing report , project manager: Oh marketing: maybe you ca you can look at  that project manager: no , I didn't have that . marketing: and user interface: Where would we want the  teletext button ? marketing: Ah yeah . project manager: All it tells just let's make make a new marketing: And one user interface: Do we put it somewhere over here ? project manager: tick the new one . Yeah , let's increase it a little because marketing: And  wha what people want , I've  user interface: Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas . project manager: Yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible marketing: I have another thing  project manager: just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , user interface: Yeah . project manager: so the more less important user interface: Well , we have decided more or less the basic structure . user interface: I can put the other buttons in project manager: Just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best . industrial designer: What  what did you wanna say ? project manager: Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . marketing:  what I al already said is the the  the remote controls are always lost , user interface: Maybe another idea  . marketing: but it it's also for people , they want to learn it fast , industrial designer:  . marketing: not  they want to project manager: Yeah , so we don't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . marketing: It's yeah , it's easy to learn user interface: Yes , but it should cover all the functions , marketing: wi and  project manager: Well user interface: so possibly , just an idea that popped in project manager: what we had function that what people do , marketing:  project manager: so . People change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . That's the basic fu that's what you do I'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented . user interface: Yeah , but we could go a step further , marketing: And The If user interface: because some T_V_s have the  possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . user interface: Yes , but it Because we're making industrial designer: But that's the question , is it ? marketing:  industrial designer: Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . project manager: Yeah , but industrial designer: If it isn't , then we cannot reach it . industrial designer:  isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? If you rule out functions , then  and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . marketing: user interface: No , I thi industrial designer: Then the consumer bond or something says  you cannot do this and that with it . That's a bad bad com commercial marketing: If  project manager:  we'll we'll see what we can come up with . marketing: Another thing I want to say is that  we are looking at the market for the age  younger than forty . marketing:  on my report , I didn't  ish I didn't show it in my  presentation , project manager: Yeah , project manager:  shall we ? industrial designer: Do they realise how much that costs ? marketing: and industrial designer: That's almost undoable . user interface: Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . marketing:  but project manager: That's all here , here it says industrial designer: No , that's that's . marketing: So  user interface: marketing: we can project manager: Speech recognition is quite marketing: We can look at the possibilities for an  L_C_D_ and  project manager: Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , marketing: I dunno . project manager: it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , marketing: How much it will cost industrial designer:  . Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes . industrial designer:  I user interface: Well marketing:  user interface: I doubt it , but industrial designer: But I really need finance information . Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , marketing: Different colours maybe . marketing: But all industrial designer: This is Philips , huh ? project manager: I have no clue . Oh , I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , project manager: I think it's a very industrial designer: because I need to put all the electronics in it . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: If we make it s  smaller ,  less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: because I have to put all the electronics in it . project manager: Huh even if user interface: So project manager: in the worst case we can even user interface: what kind of project manager: Could you give me the pen back ? user interface: Yeah , sure . project manager: So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . marketing: project manager: It doesn't have to be really big , but just just have to be has to be there . project manager: Think it's a good place , people don't marketing: If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it  at the top . project manager: No ? It's not that  it's not the most important function , industrial designer: Me too . marketing: It's j project manager: it's just an extra thing , industrial designer: Ah project manager: it just you press the buttons on top , marketing:  . But i if you if you are going to  put the L_C_D_ on it , I think it's very important to use it , industrial designer: but . marketing:  because it's use it  project manager: How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ? marketing: But nee the function of it . project manager:  if you t if you press a button , you can see it , industrial designer:  . project manager: ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . marketing: so project manager:  this looks a little user interface: I'm still not convinced of the marketing: you must use the maximum of it . project manager: if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , industrial designer: They want it  . But  industrial designer: Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space . user interface: So basically industrial designer: But if we user interface: can I project manager:  we have green now  user interface: what we have to decide now is  what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ? project manager: Or maybe we should m we could  draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . user interface: Yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , project manager: because it marketing: Yeah . project manager: We're not sure about the size anyway , user interface: So maybe you'd put them here . For example if you take  user interface: Yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . For example just industrial designer: If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . project manager: I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely . Yeah , but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . project manager: The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big . So either user interface: So would we like this or would we like the project manager: We either we have to decide what what people want . project manager: so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here . marketing: Or And  what about speech recognition  project manager: Well you can just no , I'm not sure if we can do that , marketing: Yeah , yeah , project manager: but we could put a microphone in here for example . project manager: Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . industrial designer: One more  thing I'd like to say ,  let's give this  a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . marketing: Yeah , okay , yeah , industrial designer: Shall we all try  to think about a name ? user interface: So I think of a name . project manager: Okay , at anyways , the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , user interface: So project manager: so there we go  . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , I've Do we  save the ? project manager: marketing: <doc-sep>user interface:  ? marketing: industrial designer: I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . project manager:  we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . project manager: then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . project manager: Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . industrial designer: Different pen widths , how do you do that ? user interface: project manager:  with the format menu . project manager: And what's that supposed to be ? industrial designer: Are you serious ? marketing: Should it be one project manager: Oh yeah . marketing: so y you must save it at the end project manager: Yeah marketing: and then project manager: you can press the next button , which is  yeah . user interface: industrial designer: How much time do we have to draw anyway ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: What is it ? industrial designer: marketing: user interface: It's a it's a giraffe . Yeah I see a long neck user interface: Yeah , that's a project manager: but marketing: It's more like a dinosaur . user interface: industrial designer: Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ? project manager: Yeah sorry , introduction and get acquainted marketing:  project manager: and industrial designer: Alright . user interface: project manager: Yeah it's a bit slow , marketing: It's not that fast . user interface: 'Cause it's so project manager: You were slow too user interface: 'cause it's green . marketing: So  some other line  width  industrial designer: Do you have a turtle pet ? project manager: user interface: marketing: No . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: Yeah not exactly legs but More like fins marketing: industrial designer: Stumpy stuff . user interface: marketing: or project manager: There's a a gum , marketing: Yeah ? Alright . industrial designer: And why did you choose this animal ? marketing: So project manager: He said it was slow . marketing: A cat who had an accident or project manager: Why a cat ? industrial designer:  yeah I dunno . Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of project manager: The pen , industrial designer: st Oh shit . It's my favourite  pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . industrial designer: Or do I need to use more colours and project manager: I think it's okay . Okay industrial designer: So we have to s project manager: now it's time for some discussion . project manager:  did any of you already do some work on this part or industrial designer: Well I started making an overview for myself ,  what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . industrial designer: So I had to  , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , project manager: industrial designer: and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . And do you have any ideas about the product  so far ? industrial designer: Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . industrial designer: And  let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . industrial designer: and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , user interface: Okay , yeah . project manager:  and what did the Marketing Expert do ? marketing:  well from a marketing  perspective ,  well the function des design phase  consists out of the user requirements . marketing:  what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that  by by doing research  to see what existing products are there out in the market . marketing:  especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions  which can be added to our product ? project manager: For example for  well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of  current and future televisions ? project manager: Yep . What w what would they like to see  on a new remote control ?  especially for future users , project manager: Okay . marketing:  I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , project manager: marketing: and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to  to add . project manager:  but have you any idea so far as what  the user requirements are ? marketing: No n not specifically . user interface: I got some  requirements marketing: and project manager: Yeah ? user interface: it has  it has to be user-friendly . user interface:  really easy to use buttons , not not  very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . project manager:  what do you mean by that ? user interface:  the distance  from your television to your  remote control has to be ,  yeah  yeah , quite a big distance . project manager:  user interface: Are you going to put the the notes on the project manager: Yeah , in the project folder . industrial designer: Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next  session ? user interface: Yeah . Because then we have a user interface: After that we are going to the conceptual  project manager: Yeah . project manager: Y you do some individual work , marketing: We're just working the three phases . And then I have to prepare  I have to defend our design , user interface: project manager: so make it good . marketing: Better make it industrial designer: I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . industrial designer: Do we  , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: I would first m industrial designer: So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . marketing: Yeah project manager: You can always add a few marketing: well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . marketing: So you can switch to your video project manager: marketing: and then the same buttons control your video . marketing: And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . industrial designer: Yeah so marketing: And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control . industrial designer: Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . industrial designer: And and for a t  teletext you need additional buttons as well , marketing: No . project manager: We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video "

        "Query": "Why did the team have doubts about relying solely on speech recognition and eliminating buttons for the remote control? What challenges did they face in implementing speech recognition in the new remote controls?",
        "Summary": "Age group data for remote control use was not available, but it is acknowledged that many people may not want to learn how to use a new remote control. Despite this, certain buttons such as channel control, volume settings, and on/off are still necessary. The Industrial Designer raised concerns about the size and bulkiness of remote controls with too many buttons, while a small and slim design was deemed prone to being lost. The User Interface suggested a PDA or hand-held type of remote control, but this was deemed unfriendly in terms of unit price. Marketing expressed concerns about the cost and price implications of implementing voice recognition, arguing that the elderly would not find it user-friendly compared to an LCD screen. The Project Manager agreed with Marketing's opinion and prioritized the LCD screen over voice recognition. The Project Manager also noted the difficulty of implementing speech recognition in remotes due to noise interference, which was expensive to solve. However, the User Interface proposed a solution involving a signal-emitting device built into the TV and a microphone and transmitter on the remote control, utilizing subtractive cancellation of noise.",
        "Article": " these are hopefully the points you addressed in  your pre  presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes .  requirements are  teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that  button information .  does somebody have any comments on these requirements ?

So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing ,  I suggest let's get started with the presentations . 'Kay I'm  gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . And  besides that  I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be .  for our  group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is  , these factors are slightly more equal .  this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about  the look-and-feel that  the remote should have . Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would  be the innovativeness in the remote control .  well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped .  besides that we would advise  to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . Any questions about the the trends ? marketing: Any questions ? project manager: Mayb user interface:  no . So  only  buttons  for  sound ,  for  on-off ,   shifting u up  sa  ca channel or  down shifting down .  you can think about   when you lost your  remote control , you can  call it and  it gives an  sig signal . And and  for  shifting up a sen  c ch channel or  for   putting out  sound or something , you can  just give a sign  say  sound off or A and  yeah .  double push push  , if double click ,  so  you get  big  subtitles , for  people    which c f  who can't  read small  subtitles . So   Yeah and w we have to keep  in general buttons  so  we've got  the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower ,  the numbers ,  zero to   nine . And  we can  build in a function f which  shows the channel or some  which the t television is on . Just  we can put  the on-off button  over in this  corner ,  almost  e all  remote controls  are using a on-off button on that place . So   and a special  button for shifting up  and  shifting down  channel ,  it's  on place where  the thumb of of the So you you can  easily  shift up or shift down . So  and  all the f functions for subtitle  one button ,  for sound   and  for our design ,   we have to discuss about it  I think  so  the form of it so project manager: Okay .  for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy .  for the casing ,  the  manufacturing department can deliver  a flat casing , single or double curved casing .  as a case supplement , we could  , I thought of that l later ,  a rubber  belt , like a anti-slip . And the chip-set ,  it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_  screen . And as  the trend-watcher presentation showed ,  people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines .  first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's  has a pretty big influence on production price ,  and image . user interface: project manager:  so  f I think first of all we have to see  it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think . marketing: And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? industrial designer: Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . marketing: And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can  get great popularity for our product . user interface: But marketing:  wel user interface: what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up  the batteries . marketing: Yeah you could load up the batteries , user interface: B b marketing: you could  insert the find the lost remote control function in there .  it's  just a small display so I believe  it will run on one battery for  six months or f or or more . project manager:  user interface:  so project manager:  well I think  elderly people just like to have everything in place . project manager: And I don't think they they like  remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . project manager: But I think it's  more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . project manager: So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . project manager: And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . marketing: I'm wondering  what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: 'Cause in our earlier  market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .  we also  asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . marketing: So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control user interface:  . user interface: marketing: I think that would be better to  insert in our other product , that is meant for the project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . It's a bit higher percentage , but marketing:  well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would  help in making the remote control easier to use . user interface: But  is  our  research  about  bi large  L_C_D_ sh  display , or  just a small one  we want to  use ? marketing:  well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . project manager: I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . project manager: So in that case we could use kinetic  energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . industrial designer: Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . project manager:  but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . project manager: Look I've got a new remote control , and  industrial designer: user interface:  I dunno . project manager: But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? industrial designer:  I dunno . project manager: It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . So   you 'cause  Yeah with  mobile phones   so  like the Nokia mobile phones ,  when you can change the case of it . So   you have just to make one  standard  remote control , and  yeah you can sell  few  project manager: You can sell the cases . Because  then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: Because that's a it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , user interface: Yeah . marketing: 'Cause we would have to make one w  control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . So marketing: So that would project manager: you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . marketing: Well I wouldn't design a telephone industrial designer: marketing: but user interface: marketing: Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one  project manager: Remote . marketing: one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . project manager: So everybody's okay with the changing covers ? I think that's a good  good option . marketing: Could you explain that a little more ? industrial designer: Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . marketing: And what would single curved and double curved mean ? industrial designer:  it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . project manager:  but the form has to be  It has to It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ? marketing: No just to lie down . project manager: And the the cover of the the docking station is also marketing: We'll go for that . What type of interface do we want to use ?  maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the marketing: project manager: Does somebody have ideas for a form or user interface:  we can just use the regular form of it , but it's  not quite  fancy . marketing:  you  said you wanted to put the  changing channels button on the right side , user interface: Yeah . marketing: Well  I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . Yeah we Is it possible to  program it s so  you got on the left side  or on the right side  buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the  other   o other side  buttons for  shifting ,  for for the sound ? Or Or isn't it ? marketing: For the volume . marketing: that could Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . project manager: Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , user interface: Yeah okay . project manager: marketing: But if we would make  a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . Or we have to make a left  For lefties project manager: Can't we make  Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same user interface: and  project manager: functions as the normal one ? user interface: You mean  project manager: Then you have to user interface: Yeah if project manager: Let's see if I ca A blank one . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with  choosing a channel marketing: Yeah . user interface: So  it's project manager: I think we could just  leave it a normal shape . industrial designer: The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . project manager: I suggest  the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . user interface: project manager:  so that elderly people can  use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . user interface: So  Do you say this  S   you got like  sort of a I believe There ? marketing: user interface: So  you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? project manager: Yeah .  project manager: But now it's user interface: we can make it  project manager: Do you have it upside down or user interface:  ? project manager: Do you have it user interface: That's the top . user interface:  rem project manager: So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . user interface: Yeah but this place  project manager: If you can have this one , you turn it like this . user interface:  it's Yeah I dunno  project manager: Because  maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . user interface: industrial designer: It's more logical to have it on top as well project manager: I think i industrial designer: because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . But  the on-off button ,  still on the top  project manager: Yeah still here user interface: Yeah . Where's my mouse ? Then We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now for the next meeting  we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . project manager: And then we're going to  try to finish our project , and  make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first <doc-sep>project manager:  minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we  had decided on roles for each of you , however ,  there are some changes that I've got from on high user interface: Okay . project manager: that  are a bit  well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the  this is for a specific television . project manager: actually I'll get to that at the end point number four ,  we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . marketing: user interface: marketing: Sh do you want me to hold it ? project manager:  there we go , just screw 'em on in . Gonna have to swap them round so marketing: So , after that ? project manager: now , it was function F_ eight .  , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , yeah sure . project manager: marketing: yes , I have to look at the  market potential for this product , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? Then project manager: P press F_ five to start it first . A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . And what we got was , we found that if you  , what they th what problems they are having with different  remote controls available in the market . So , we have to put stress on this ,  we have to take care of this fact also like our design ,  should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers .  and even  the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high  pay more for this  good looking remote controls also . So even if the available market goes for the available  even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better  better look  designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . marketing: Then And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users  or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if  the consumers they want to use it . user interface: So , sorry I was just gonna say , what was the question for this ? Or is are you coming on to that ? marketing: Ah t look all the market potential , what  how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . So these percentages are are what ? marketing: Yeah , these are different age group persons like  sorry , I can open it in another way . If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to  pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this  this  point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . industrial designer: marketing: So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from  fifteen to thirty five , user interface:  . marketing: and I  and I think that most of the users of the rem  T_V_ are belong to this age group . marketing: So , and project manager: marketing: And then project manager: Fifteen to twe marketing: Yes .  if we look at this data how how  h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . project manager: marketing: They find that thirt  thirty five percent  thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl  spe  proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see  to know how to operate these remote controls . marketing: So this is also a very goo  major factor to loo  take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . user interface: Yep , sure , that's cool ,  marketing: Yeah we have to take that out . user interface: Okay , and then what do I press , F_ eight ? marketing:  F_ eight . user interface: Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big project manager:  F_ five . user interface: F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? marketing: Escape . project manager: F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just  the left button for advancing . user interface: Okay , so  I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry ,  I'm concerned with  w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and  I'm I'm also I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , project manager: user interface: so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? project manager:  just a left  user interface: The arrow ? Okay . user interface: So  I looked at existing designs and also  the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike .  and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main  buyers of of our T_V_ I think . user interface: And ergonomics , we said  , I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , project manager: industrial designer: user interface: but  maybe that comes up , I don't know . user interface: And the findings , well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set .  , so they need to be included , but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . I don't know how to get to them , project manager:  if you if you escape then you can see your bar . user interface: You know they're grey , they've  this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , project manager: user interface: and they don't look very exciting at all .  , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , project manager: user interface: but there you go , that's what we're up against , project manager: user interface: and I think we can do much better than that .  , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite  important ,  project manager: Yeah , particularly if we've  there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well . And  I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand-held more  not as  computery and project manager: Organic .  simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , marketing: project manager: user interface: so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . user interface: hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just  released  I think is it a a remote control for presentations or  and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so  project manager: Yeah it's like a , yeah . user interface: Yeah , no seven inches isn't that big but  anyway  so hand-held and portable and  m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , project manager: Right . project manager: And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for  to keep down the production time . And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark project manager: user interface:  which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . user interface: or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . industrial designer: So  , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , user interface: Okay ? industrial designer: and  I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?  , or if project manager: user interface: industrial designer: is that a function we want in the remote ? project manager: do you have trouble whistling ? user interface: I haven't been able to industrial designer: I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right . industrial designer:  it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? project manager: Yeah , I suppose that's true . user interface: - , yeah project manager: Well I suppo  you could y you could have the user interface: or some sort of voice project manager: you could have the basically  instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? . industrial designer:  a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping  , shouting , you know , project manager:  . industrial designer:  and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ? project manager: Sounds good . So I plug it in , press F_ five ? Function F_ five ? project manager: Function F_ eight for the  the  industrial designer: Or function F_ eight ? Okay . So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , user interface: industrial designer:  so it's good you went first , project manager: Alright . industrial designer: and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and  what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . industrial designer:  so Raj told us that  consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and  he also mentioned that  the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour .  , a lot of the buttons aren't used , and  he mentioned that they're not fun to use . And  a novel feature which  we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , project manager: industrial designer: there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold  it'll pick up as a a distress signal  from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . But sure surely that would have to be  sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . industrial designer: Well maybe you could have a   tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . industrial designer: Yeah well tha that's  for later down the road  , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy ,  and not computery , user interface: industrial designer: right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . project manager: industrial designer: And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our  our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , user interface: industrial designer: which include , you know ,  space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains Or  or a high speed train . project manager: Ah is that what that is ? user interface: industrial designer: Right and having personally worked with all these products  I have a great deal of experience with  with industrial design of these . If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . project manager: industrial designer: You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and  user interface: project manager: marketing:  . Give it one button user interface: industrial designer: and and it's a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us marketing: project manager: industrial designer: I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but project manager: Right okay . industrial designer: Yeah it's a g  you could have a you know a project manager: Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? industrial designer: Right . marketing: Fifty million was  prof project manager: Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta  we've g marketing: As a profit . project manager: gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic  , you know ,  that should be just like  a tenth of the price maybe or less . industrial designer: we don't wanna have it project manager: Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? industrial designer:  . user interface: That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries . project manager:  if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , user interface: A battery in it , kinda . industrial designer:  the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we  of course will have alternatives like  speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power project manager: Okay . user interface: industrial designer:  and lastly the transmission interface is  , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . industrial designer:  so here's you know , a great schematic that my  apprentice designer gave me . project manager: user interface: industrial designer:  as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and  you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so  personal preferences , I think  programmable options which  just require a small amount of memory ,  non volatile memory , just  so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . And the  , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting ,  more technical  expenditure of effort project manager: user interface: industrial designer: and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . project manager: Right , also so  a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is let's see , I'll find it myself ,  Ta industrial designer: Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in . project manager: We had that  to dis-include teletext  because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . project manager:  it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , user interface: Okay . project manager: and  instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . project manager: And the logo  the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics  I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor  , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . project manager: Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . project manager: now , we had as listed options we had industrial designer: project manager: speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface  we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read . project manager: So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a user interface: Well project manager: or it looks like we're just cutting on the  user interface:  . project manager: I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . project manager:  maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send marketing: About cost . project manager: some information about that , about  what people , whether people would require  teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . So  I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . project manager:  so  a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of  web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav  sorry Raj  said people didn't like . project manager: If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever , user interface: project manager: I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far user interface: Yeah . project manager: but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have  it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple . project manager:  glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? user interface:  marketing:  . So marketing: I user interface: so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . marketing:  actually I think it's really really very important point  as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . But user interface: Often lost s was that , marketing: yeah are lost project manager: Lost , yeah . But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , user interface: marketing: like if they come and speak something at the remote control  replies to something something and it glows in the dark . Both these factors  both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , project manager: That's cool . user interface: - , marketing: and this will definitely enhance our  market sales , project manager: That's cool . project manager:  speech recognition I take it user interface: industrial designer: Oh it's project manager: I don't , I've I know of no products  that use speech recognition well . industrial designer: They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like  B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . project manager: Really ? industrial designer: Yeah , it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . project manager: Yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . user interface: industrial designer: Right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , project manager:  . user interface: Well what about industrial designer: user interface: this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about  something that's built into the T_V_  that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something project manager: Ah , that's a good idea . user interface: If you find if y industrial designer: Right and then it would do just you know ,  subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . industrial designer: What you could do then would be you have  a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't  expect  the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s . industrial designer: But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker project manager: That we should just stick on , yeah . industrial designer: Right , and then the remote control would know  what's being produced by the television . project manager: And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap . Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . You just say you know ,  whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to  turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . And  you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . user interface: That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete .  so I think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , user interface:  . project manager: So I think if we're going to go well  like the thing about the there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of  organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . project manager: but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . user interface: Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said  colours and fashion w were important so maybe  just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . industrial designer: Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just  the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then  if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it  it won't glow any more . project manager:  Okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , user interface: Yeah , project manager:  if we're gonna have to user interface: 'cause what I thought , main project manager: if we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our  slogan . project manager:  then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . 'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can  still see the remote control . project manager: Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of   of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then .  so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? industrial designer:  yeah we're getting a lot of features now , I I think project manager: Well  I think I think the sort of find the finder things  it's  I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . project manager:  industrial designer: Well , I think a consideration too is that these  remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around , user interface:  . industrial designer: there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or  get damaged . user interface: So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ? project manager:  no ,  that was going on ravs  Raj's sort of  marketing research I guess . So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff ,  industrial designer: Yeah  . project manager: If you could find out that  marketing: Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi project manager:  I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a industrial designer: Oh . project manager:  expensive , user interface: Yeah you think so ? industrial designer: Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . industrial designer: And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , project manager: Is it not the circuits that cost industrial designer: like a project manager: Oh right , okay . industrial designer: project manager:  well that kind of takes back the R_F_ the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well . marketing: project manager: Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? industrial designer: Okay . And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , user interface:  project manager: programmability . project manager:  user interface: if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick .  can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . industrial designer: project manager: And  I'll put any I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so  user interface: And where is it sorry ? project manager:  pro  project documents . industrial designer: So it should be when you save project manager: On A_M_I_ scenario controller . marketing:  it is in shared documents ? industrial designer: And then  hit that little folder up thing again . project manager: And I will tr getting strings of  information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than industrial designer: project manager: I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so user interface: Okay . project manager: So user interface: What I thought as well about the material is  maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like  this kind of rubbery material , it's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . user interface: The rubber rather than project manager: More sort of  flesh-like than plasticky sort of . marketing:  but we have to take care like project manager: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . user interface: marketing: So we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . industrial designer: user interface: Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good ,  project manager: Yeah . user interface: industrial designer: We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . marketing: project manager: industrial designer: And there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . project manager: yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry . user interface: Yeah , d with the colour ,  does it have to be all yellow , do you know ? project manager: Please God no . project manager: my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so I think just having it user interface: Yeah . project manager: And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the user interface: Cool . project manager: what was it ? We put we put fashion into Whoops , it's not working . project manager: Okay , that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one <doc-sep> I'll briefly go through the  notes of the of the last meeting  just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and  n nobody's working equally , user interface: Sorry .  we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the  b a boring shape and boring colour .  and and we s we saw that the  what we needed to do was to to make sure the device  controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at  anything in particular ,  that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .  should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it ,  illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms .  before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that  the the management have placed on us and  will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting .  the  the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and  the they don't necessarily agree with with what we  we thought .  and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device  actually b carrying out , and we have  forty minutes to do this in and I  Anyway . Now , the n the new requirements are  the the management team see that  teletext is no longer of any importance given the  the rise of the internet .  now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s ,  satellite boxes , which   we saw as being fundamental to the  to the exercise .  and on that basis  I I think we we need to bear that in mind ,  but possibly  keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they  no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things .  the the logo  being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against  a yellow background .  now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market .  it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway .  but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which    is is is their choice , but   we we need to talk that through .  okay , so  after the meeting it'll be summarised and  industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  notes sent out and  etcetera .  again I there is no order of precedence here  so I I I'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ? marketing:  I don't mind . project manager: marketing: I got a how do I start there ? project manager: Oh , if you click on the   the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what  is needed by people and what they want to see .  everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff .  along with  looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be  more cost effective and we can put the price up . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as  they they don't  they , yeah , they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was   th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . I took to mean that they just they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume . And  yeah ,  I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause  wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but  oh and we're going to see  on the  that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user . marketing: I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . And  , yep , the  time taken to learn new remote controls is  don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for  new like first time users and stuff . And  repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . project manager: Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . It also asked  if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition project manager: marketing: and younger people say they would . And  there was another section on our on the report for  L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . project manager: Yeah , I must say that  the  I c can't remember what  f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked  remarkably well , so that is indeed a   a thought marketing: And  it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you project manager: and it it cuts out  I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , industrial designer: project manager: j just get jaw ache . marketing: Yeah ,  oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design .  functionality ,  like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily user interface: It could be oh  I was just gonna say  maybe like the flip phones that they use ? industrial designer:  . user interface: that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , marketing: Oh yeah . project manager: If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all  remove them altogether . marketing: Just remove them completely ? project manager: We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with  user interface: That might be the project manager: I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that  the  now the the age structure we were looking at   w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . project manager: Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group ,  to put myself right in the middle of it ,  u use remote controls to a great extent . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: Yes we marketing:  no this is for pay more for speech recognition . So , we're looking at  well again , we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups . project manager: If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . industrial designer: P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . project manager: But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ industrial designer: It might marketing: Or even  you could even just have it left on . user interface: Maybe i marketing: You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to user interface: Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box project manager: user interface: and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , industrial designer:  . project manager: It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , industrial designer:  . project manager: because if somebody actually on the television says   , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might  change itself , marketing: B_B_C_ one . marketing: project manager: so it probably needs to be  possibly actually need a button on it user interface: Yeah , that's true . project manager: Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then user interface: Yeah . project manager: marketing: Relevance of two out of ten , project manager: Vol volume , marketing: yeah . project manager: yes  industrial designer: They're not used often project manager: th industrial designer: but they are quite important when they're used . And  I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment ,  the channel and volume industrial designer:  . project manager: and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . So if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different ,  incorporates the the logo and and the colours and  we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey ,  and  I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . marketing:  you were saying about  it could technical problems of like  someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed project manager: marketing: 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , project manager: Depe  i depends whether  industrial designer:  . project manager: if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say marketing: Oh I see . marketing:  I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . project manager:  and I I I s so I suppose one  could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . Do you want to just carry on with marketing: Oh no project manager: or marketing: I I interrupted you , project manager: no no , no  b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on  a remote  that looks better , combined with  decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might  turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it  marketing: Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , project manager: 'cause we're marketing: we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . marketing: So  yeah , if we could  power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really project manager: The  the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . project manager: No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it  , you know , visually very distinctive . Okay , who sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? marketing:  yeah , yeah , that's everything . marketing: Do you want the cable ? user interface: Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . user interface: So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and  identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . This one  this is the user centred , it has  quite a few    fewer buttons marketing: user interface: and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , project manager: user interface: and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the  logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know , fewer buttons .  we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , project manager: yeah . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark ,  the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . project manager: Okay , can I  I'm actually gonna use the  it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . industrial designer: Oh yeah , they're all they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em . project manager: Yes , rather than the  the the traditional in fact ,  I won't even go that far .  something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape ,  that you you sort of hold in your hand , well I'm trying to think    l  l such as   something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , you know , the  the infrared or whatever source . project manager:  so that you know , it's flying off in all directions , industrial designer:  . project manager: so that    again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of  actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the  such a source ,  you know , compromise the our our need for  you know , it it being   permanently  you know , available . industrial designer: project manager:  whether whether different technology   th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time .  we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different ,  you know , short range , not like the old  radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours .  industrial designer: user interface: project manager: but   I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off .  so that it can al it could  almost end up like that , but again , except that  you know the risk of losing it .  anyway okay  so Kate , wh what are your  your thoughts on this ? industrial designer: Yes ,  . industrial designer: Which one does this plug into ? user interface:  I think it's all there . user interface: H industrial designer: I can't did you could you see it on you screen when it user interface: Oh yeah .  the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever . marketing: industrial designer:  and it does this  by well , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages  within the remote  which will then be sent to the  the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do .  and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and  the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it .  what we need  technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source ,  some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . industrial designer: which feeds into the circuit chip  which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to  a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons .  also send signals to the  infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ? Sends signals to the the television . user interface: industrial designer: And so my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big  energy source that won't die out ,  perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to  be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you .  a wide range  sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed .  also definitely a user-friendly interface  and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . project manager:  I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of  remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones .  given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's  , you know never needs replacing . industrial designer: project manager:  perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control ,   you know , one some sort of typical usage . By which time  when all's said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale . project manager:   p perhaps we should , know , reduce the  , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and  industrial designer: Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? project manager: Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one . user interface: project manager:  it's , you know , it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well , it's actually a marketing gimmick .  so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is   unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it marketing: It could have like  know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . industrial designer:  yeah user interface: I would think that people might forget project manager: I I th I think user interface:  people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , marketing: industrial designer: project manager:   I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge industrial designer:  . project manager: and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . Yeah , when it turns itself off , that's when I plug it in , project manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah , so   industrial designer: yeah . user interface: project manager: what so wh what what do we think about the  the the permanent  battery ? industrial designer: Yeah , think that's a good idea . project manager: Is the  you know , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex  external simplicity here . project manager:  you know , cut cost within the manufacturing and  you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective .  I can't think of anything off the s top of my head , industrial designer: They usually have the little light  source , project manager: but there are certainly things that you buy . industrial designer: I dunno what the heck they're called , user interface: Yeah , they have that little solar industrial designer: the but project manager: Som well some do , industrial designer: yeah , the little cells that project manager:  th th but there are battery ones industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , project manager:   industrial designer: so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it . project manager: I would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life . industrial designer: Oh , it depend if it's  depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking , user interface: Yeah , some people are project manager: If , but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then  then  then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market industrial designer: yeah . marketing: W project manager: n marketing: like like this  this  market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight user interface: Per hour ? project manager: Right . project manager: Oh , I must admit I hadn't  I'd I'd missed that . user interface: marketing: But then again , if you think it of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like project manager: Yeah . project manager: Well that's right , and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , industrial designer:  . project manager: sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , I don't know I don't actually know . user interface: Though I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different project manager: industrial designer: project manager: Right , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared . Possibly no buttons at all  , but if you can incorporate  channel change and volume buttons  in into the design , then then that's fine .  in the  the the role of the of the  the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an a   a serious constraint .  I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition  and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off .  it needs to incorporate the corporate logo ,  the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce  interchangeable  covers . So are we doing just the television or are we doing so not D_V_D_ players , project manager: No . project manager: I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , industrial designer:  . marketing: Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ? project manager: Oh yeah well th that's one I s that's one I sent you , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: project manager: Okay , so  we can all give some thought to that  for for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed <doc-sep>industrial designer: So yeah , I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . industrial designer: So  project manager: Yeah , I was thinking that as well , I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're , user interface: Yeah the universal ones . project manager:  'cause  , what  twenty five Euros , that's about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ? And that's quite a lot for a remote control . As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , project manager: -huh .  , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so  I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , project manager: Okay . marketing: being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? project manager: Okay . marketing: What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like user interface: Okay . marketing: and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li  like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . marketing: They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: what do we think a project manager: So , we're looking for 'Kay . industrial designer: What do we think a good size would be for this ? project manager: We're marketing: industrial designer: 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky project manager: Sorry , carry on . user interface: industrial designer: and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , project manager: user interface: Kind of  , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , like , project manager: For for  user interface: 'cause project manager: remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . No , I wasn't , no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ project manager: Okay well right we'll have to  I'll user interface: but project manager: we're k having another meeting in half an hour so  user interface: Okay . project manager: we should all look into a bit  , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . project manager: if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into  basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . project manager: Which will probably just usurp what I said so user interface: So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? project manager: Shapes and colours and  basically how to make it attractive . marketing: project manager: So industrial designer: project manager: we have  industrial designer: Wait for emails ? marketing:  "

        "Summary": "The professor expressed his frustration with the constant delays in the TORRENT chip schedule. Grad F presented his proposal, focusing on the section on intermediate categories and suggesting the inclusion of features from these categories as a means of reducing error. The professor was particularly interested in understanding the impact of the neural net on older models that lacked pure features. While acknowledging the potential for improvement, he also cautioned against overusing nets.",
        "Article": " , I can say about just q just quickly to get through it , that Dave and I submitted this ASRU .  , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , and , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well .  , and when they had the reverberation here , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio and it 's , about nine DB . professor b: phd a: You mean , from the actual , recordings ? professor b: a fair amount of phd d: k phd a: It 's nine DB ? professor b: Yeah .  , I know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the Mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at ,  at OGI .  , but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , the the Aurora HTK system baseline system and the system that we were the the  , other system we were using , the  , the SRI system , was that the SRI system had maybe a , hundred hertz high - pass . professor b: For some reason , Dave thought it was twenty , phd d:  So the , center would be somewhere around like hundred professor b: but . professor b: But do you know , for instance , h how far down it would be at twenty hertz ? What the how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz , let 's say ? phd d: At twenty hertz . professor b: Yeah , any idea what the curve looks like ? phd d: Twenty hertz frequency Oh , it 's it 's zero at twenty hertz , right ? The filter ? phd c: Yea - actually , the left edge of the first filter is at sixty - four . professor b: It 's actually set to zero ? What kind of filter is that ? phd c: Yeah . professor b: Is this oh , from the from phd c: It This is the filter bank in the frequency domain that starts at sixty - four . professor b: Oh , so you ,  so you really set it to zero , the FFT ? phd d: Yeah , phd c: Yeah . So I wonder , is it @ @ Was there their experimentation with , say , throwing away that filter or something ? And ,  phd d: throwing away the first ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: Right , but the question is , whether sixty - four hertz is is , too , low . phd d: I t I think I 've tried a hundred and it was more or less the same , or slightly worse . professor b: On what test set ? phd d: On the same , SpeechDat - Car , Aurora . professor b: phd d: So it was professor b: and on and on the , TI - digits also ? phd d: No , no , no . That 'd be something to look at sometime because what , eh , he was looking at was performance in this room . professor b: Would that be more like Well , you 'd think that 'd be more like SpeechDat - Car , I guess , in terms of the noise .  , the signal - to - noise ratio , you know , looks a fair amount better if you if you high - pass filter it from this room . professor b: So , the main the the phd a: So that 's on th that 's on the f the far field ones though , right ? Yeah . phd a: So wha what is ,  what 's causing that ? professor b: Well , we got a a video projector in here , and ,  which we keep on during every every session we record , phd a: Yeah . professor b: which , you know , I I w we were aware of phd a:  - huh . professor b: But but ,  So , those are those are major components , I think , phd a: I see . professor b: but , it ,  I guess , I maybe I said this last week too but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise . And , so I think when when he gets done with his prelim study I think one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , noise , processing stuff and and , synthesize some speech from it . phd a: When are his prelims ? professor b: And then  , I think in about , a little less than two weeks .  , let 's see , this is the sixteenth , seventeenth ? Yeah , I don't know if he 's before It might even be in a week . I I guessed that they were gonna do it some time during the semester professor b: week and a half . phd a: but they 'll do it any time , huh ? professor b: They seem to be Well , the semester actually is starting up . phd a: Is it already ? professor b: Yeah , the semester 's late late August they start here .  , that that was sort of one  , the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set . And But if you had a a really big training set , a recognizer , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set I thought that One thing with the HTK is that is has the as we 're using the configuration we 're using is w s is being bound by the terms of Aurora , we have all those parameters just set as they are . So even if we had a hundred times as much data , we wouldn't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many Gaussians or anything .  , so , that ,  that seemed to be So , if you have that that better recognizer that can that can build up more parameters , and if you , have the natural room , which in this case has a p a pretty bad signal - to - noise ratio , then in that case , the right thing to do is just do u use speaker adaptation . But I think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise - processing as well as , the convolutional kind of things we were doing . phd d: That sample was released only yesterday or the day before , right ? phd a: No Well , I haven't grabbed that one yet . phd d: Oh , there is another short sample set phd a: There was another short one , yeah . phd a: And so I haven't grabbed the latest one that he just , put out yet . professor b: Is there any word yet about the issues about , adjustments for different feature sets or anything ? phd a: No , I I d You asked me to write to him and I think I forgot to ask him about that . phd d: Cuz they have it phd a: Maybe I 'll send it to the list . phd d: Cuz they have , already frozen those in i insertion penalties and all those stuff is what I feel . phd d: And , on that , they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those phd a: And so they 've picked the values . professor b: For r w what test set ? phd d: p the one that they have reported is a NIST evaluation , Wall Street Journal . professor b: But that has nothing to do with what we 're testing on , right ? phd c:   So they 're , like  So they are actually trying to , fix that those values using the clean , training part of the Wall Street Journal . phd d: they want to train it and then this they 're going to run some evaluations . professor b: So they 're set they 're setting it based on that ? phd d: Yeah . So now , we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we can't modify these parameters . professor b:  but it 's still worth , I think , just since you know , just chatting with Joe about the issue . Do you think that 's something I should just send to him professor b:  phd a: or do you think I should send it to this there 's an a m a mailing list .  , we 're , you know , certainly willing to talk about it with everybody , but I think I think that , it 's probably best to start talking with him just to phd a: OK . professor b:  @ @ you know , it 's a dialogue between two of you about what you know , what does he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it . professor b: if you get ten people in involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how phd a: Yeah . professor b: but if if if there is any , way to move in a way that would that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features . But if if ,  if there isn't , and it 's just kind of shut down and and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in . phd d: Because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for Linux and all those . phd d: SUSI phd a: Yeah , SUSI or whatever it was phd d: yeah . professor b: but , I noticed , just glancing at the , Hopkins workshop , web site that ,  one of the thing I don't know Well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a , tool kit for doing ,  r  , arbitrary graphical models for , speech recognition . professor b: So And Jeff ,  the two Jeffs were phd a: Who 's the second Jeff ? professor b:  Oh , do you know Geoff Zweig ? phd a: No . professor b: so he did he did his PHD on dynamic Bayes - nets , for for speech recognition . He had some continuity built into the model , presumably to handle some , inertia in the in the production system , and ,  phd a:  .  , so it 's exactly the same approach , but the features that the VAD neural network use are , MFCC after noise compensation . professor b: What was it using before ? phd c: Before it was just P L phd d:  phd c: So . phd c: Yeah , phd d: Yeah , yeah , yeah , phd c: noisy noisy features . phd c:  This is what we get after This So , actually , we , yeah , here the features are noise compensated and there is also the LDA filter .  , and then it 's a pretty small neural network which use , nine frames of of six features from C - zero to C - fives , plus the first derivatives . phd a: Is that nine frames u s  , centered around the current frame ? Or phd c: Yeah . professor b: S so , I 'm I 'm sorry , there 's there 's there 's how many how many inputs ? phd c: So it 's twelve times nine . So I guess about eleven thousand parameters , which actually shouldn't be a problem , even in in small phones . phd a: So , I 'm I 'm s so what is different between this and and what you phd c: It should be OK . So the previous syst It 's based on the system that has a fifty - three point sixty - six percent improvement . The only thing that changed is the n a p eh a es the estimation of the silence probabilities . phd c:  So it 's it 's not bad , but the problem is still that the latency is too large . professor b: What 's the latency ? phd c: Because  the the latency of the VAD is two hundred and twenty milliseconds . And , the VAD is used  , i for on - line normalization , and it 's used before the delta computation . So if you add these components it goes t to a hundred and seventy , right ? professor b: I I 'm confused . You started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy ? phd c: With two an two hundred and seventy . phd c: If Yeah , if you add the c delta comp delta computation professor b: Oh . I the is this are these twenty - millisecond frames ? Is that why ? Is it after downsampling ? or phd c: The two - twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the  No , it 's forty milliseconds for t for the , cleaning of the speech . phd c: Yeah , and there is the delta at the input which is , professor b: One hundred milliseconds for smoothing . phd c:  phd d: It 's like forty plus forty plus professor b: And then forty phd c: Mmm . phd c: Yeah , there are twenty that comes from There is ten that comes from the LDA filters also . phd d: If you are using professor b:  phd c: Plus the frame , phd d: t If you are using three frames phd c: so it 's two - twenty . phd d: If you are phrasing f using three frames , it is thirty here for delta . So it 's like s five , six cepstrum plus delta at nine nine frames of professor b: And then ten milliseconds for phd d: Fi - There 's an LDA filter . professor b: ten milliseconds for LDA filter , and t and ten another ten milliseconds you said for the frame ? phd c: For the frame I guess . I computed two - twenty Yeah , well , it 's I guess it 's for the fr the professor b: OK . And then there 's delta besides that ? phd c: So this is the features that are used by our network and then afterwards , you have to compute the delta on the , main feature stream , professor b: OK . phd c: which is  , delta and double - deltas , which is fifty milliseconds . No , the after the noise part , the forty the the other hundred and eighty Well , Wait a minute . Some of this is ,  is ,  is in parallel , isn't it ?  , the LDA Oh , you have the LDA as part of the V D -  , VAD ? Or phd c: The VAD use , LDA filtered features also . professor b: so the delta at the end is how much ? phd c: It 's fifty . So phd c: But well , we could probably put the delta , before on - line normalization . It should not that make a big difference , phd a: What if you used a smaller window for the delta ? phd c: because phd a: Could that help a little bit ?  , I guess there 's a lot of things you could do to phd c: Yeah . phd c: Yeah , professor b: So phd c: but , nnn professor b: Yeah . So if you if you put the delta before the , ana on - line If Yeah phd c:   phd c: Cuz i professor b: And then y then you don't have that additive phd c: Yeah , phd d: Yep . phd c: cuz the time constant of the on - line normalization is pretty long compared to the delta window , professor b: OK . And you ought to be able to shove tw ,  sh  pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred , right ?  phd a: Is two hundred the d professor b: The hundred milla phd c:   It could be eighty and and probably do @ @ phd c: Yeah , phd a: i a hun phd c: yeah . phd a:  Wh - what 's the baseline you need to be under ? Two hundred ? professor b: Well , we don't know . professor b: if it 's two if if it 's ,  if it 's two - fifty , then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty . If it 's two hundred , if we shaved off twenty , we could we could , meet it by moving the delta back . phd a: So , how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding ? professor b: we don't , but it 's just  , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it . professor b: And so , th  , if if if a week before we have to be done someone says , \" Well , you have to have fifty milliseconds less than you have now \" , it would be pretty frantic around here . professor b:  phd a: But still , that 's that 's a pretty big , win . And it doesn't seem like you 're in terms of your delay , you 're , that professor b: He added a bit on , I guess , because before we were we were had were able to have the noise , stuff , and the LVA be in parallel . phd c: Well , but I think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . phd d: Yeah , the LDA LDA we don't know , is , like is it very crucial for the features , right ? phd c: No . professor b: so you could start pulling back , phd d: S s h professor b: but phd d: Yeah , professor b: But I think you have phd d: l professor b: you have twenty for delta computation which y now you 're sort of doing twice , right ? But yo w were you doing that before ? phd c: Mmm . Well , in the proposal , the input of the VAD network were just three frames , I think . professor b: So , what you have now is fort  , forty for the the noise , twenty for the delta , and ten for the LDA . That 's seventy milliseconds of stuff which was formerly in parallel , phd c:  professor b: right ? So I think , phd c:   professor b: you know , that 's that 's the difference as far as the timing , right ? phd c: Yeah . professor b: and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit , but  , we 're s we 're not we 're not in terrible shape . professor b: It 's it 's not like it 's adding up to four hundred milliseconds or something . phd a: Where where is this where is this fifty - seven point O two in in comparison to the last evaluation ? professor b: Well , it 's I think it 's better than anything , anybody got . Yeah , and r and phd c: It would phd d: Yeah , so this is this is like the first proposal .  , I 'm sure other people working on this are not sitting still either , but phd a: Yeah . professor b: but but , the important thing is that we learn how to do this better , and , you know . So , our ,  Yeah , you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on SpeechDat - Car which is a hard task , cuz it 's really ,  I think it 's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be . Yeah , even for a well - matched case it 's sixty percent error rate reduction , professor b: Yeah . So actually , this is in between what we had with the previous VAD and what Sunil did with an IDL VAD . Which gave sixty - two percent improvement , right ? phd d: Yeah , it 's almost that . phd a: What was that ? Say that last part again ? phd c: So , if you use , like , an IDL VAD , for dropping the frames , phd d: o o Or the best we can get . phd c: the best that we can get i That means that we estimate the silence probability on the clean version of the utterances . phd a: So that would be even That wouldn't change this number down here to sixty - two ? phd c: Yeah . So you you were get phd c: If you add a g good v very good VAD , that works as well as a VAD working on clean speech , phd a: Yeah . phd c: then you wou you would go phd a: So that 's sort of the best you could hope for . professor b: And ,  and sixty - two with the the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating VAD . phd c: yeah , the next thing is , I started to play Well , I don't want to worry too much about the delay , no . And the other stream is the output of a neural network , using as input , also , these , cleaned MFCC .  phd a: Those are th those are th what is going into the tandem net ? phd c: I don't have the comp Mmm ? phd a: Those two ? phd c: So there is just this feature stream , the fifteen MFCC plus delta and double - delta . phd a: Yeah ? phd c: so it 's makes forty - five features that are used as input to the HTK . professor b: cuz then it has one part that 's discriminative , phd c: Yeah . Right now it seems that i I just tested on SpeechDat - Car while the experiment are running on your on TI - digits . Well , it improves on the well - matched and the mismatched conditions , but it get worse on the highly mismatched .  , professor b: y phd c: like , on the well - match and medium mismatch , the gain is around five percent relative , but it goes down a lot more , like fifteen percent on the HM case . professor b: You 're just using the full ninety features ? phd c:  The professor b: Y you have ninety features ? phd c: i I have ,  From the networks , it 's twenty - eight . It 's i i i It 's because it 's what we did for the first proposal . phd c: But we have to for sure , we have to go down , because the limit is now sixty features .  phd a: So , it seems funny that I don't know , maybe I don't u quite understand everything , but that adding features I guess I guess if you 're keeping the back - end fixed . But I guess if you 're keeping the number of Gaussians fixed in the recognizer , then professor b: Well , yeah . professor b: But , just in general , adding information Suppose the information you added , well , was a really terrible feature and all it brought in was noise . professor b: Right ? So so ,  Or or suppose it wasn't completely terrible , but it was completely equivalent to another one feature that you had , except it was noisier . professor b: Right ? In that case you wouldn't necessarily expect it to be better at all . I 'm just surprised that you 're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel professor b:  - huh . professor b: So , \" highly mismatched condition \" means that in fact your training is a bad estimate of your test . professor b: So having having , a g a l a greater number of features , if they aren't maybe the right features that you use , certainly can e can easily , make things worse . If you have if you have , lots and lots of data , and you have and your your your training is representative of your test , then getting more sources of information should just help . professor b: So I wonder , Well , what 's your what 's your thought about what to do next with it ? phd c: I don't know . I 'm surprised , because I expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch , as it was the case for the professor b:   phd c: Yeah , it 's the same training set , so it 's TIMIT with the TI - digits ' , noises , added . phd c:  professor b: Well , we might  , we might have to experiment with ,  better training sets . professor b: I The other thing is , before you found that was the best configuration , but you might have to retest those things now that we have different The rest of it is different , right ? So , For instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ? phd c:   professor b: You don't necessarily know what phd a: What if you did the Would it make sense to do the KLT on the full set of combined features ? Instead of just on the phd c: Yeah . The reason I did it this ways is that in February , it we we tested different things like that , so , having two KLT , having just a KLT for a network , or having a global KLT . phd c: And phd a: So you tried the global KLT before phd c: Well phd a: and it didn't really phd c: Yeah . phd c: The differences between these configurations were not huge , but it was marginally better with this configuration . professor b: And I guess if the These are all so all of these seventy - three features are going into , the ,  the  . professor b: And is are i i are are any deltas being computed of tha of them ? phd c: Of the straight features , yeah . phd c: So , yeah , maybe we can add some context from these features also as Dan did in in his last work . i Yeah , but the other thing I was thinking was , now I lost track of what I was thinking . phd a: What is the You said there was a limit of sixty features or something ? phd c:   phd a: What 's the relation between that limit and the , forty - eight  , forty eight hundred bits per second ? professor b: Oh , I know what I was gonna say . phd a: So I I I don't understand , phd c: The f the forty - eight hundred bits is for transmission of some features . phd a: because i  , if you 're only using h phd c: And generally , i it s allows you to transmit like , fifteen , cepstrum . professor b: The issue was that , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gonna be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth . What I was going to say is that , maybe maybe with the noise removal , these things are now more correlated . So you have two sets of things that are kind of uncorrelated , within themselves , but they 're pretty correlated with one another . professor b: And , they 're being fed into these , variants , only Gaussians and so forth , and and , phd c:   professor b: so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , have , one KLT over everything , to de - correlate it . phd d: What are the S N Rs in the training set , TIMIT ? phd c: It 's , ranging from zero to clean ? Yeah . So we found this this ,  this Macrophone data , and so forth , that we were using for these other experiments , to be pretty good . professor b: So that 's i after you explore these other alternatives , that might be another way to start looking , is is just improving the training set . professor b: we were getting , lots better recognition using that , than Of course , you do have the problem that , u i we are not able to increase the number of Gaussians , or anything to , to match anything . So we 're only improving the training of our feature set , but that 's still probably something . phd a: So you 're saying , add the Macrophone data to the training of the neural net ? The tandem net ? professor b: Yeah , that 's the only place that we can train . professor b: We can't train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount , phd a: Right .  ,  phd a: What what was it trained on again ? The one that you used ? phd c: It 's TIMIT with noise . phd c: So , yeah , it 's rather a small professor b: How big is the net , by the way ? phd c: it 's , five hundred hidden units . And professor b: And again , you did experiments back then where you made it bigger and it and that was that was sort of the threshold point . @ @ ? phd d: So is it is it though the performance , big relation in the high ma high mismatch has something to do with the , cleaning up that you that is done on the TIMIT after adding noise ? phd c:  phd d: So it 's i All the noises are from the TI - digits , phd c: Yeah . phd d: right ? So you i phd c:  They k  phd d: Well , it it 's like the high mismatch of the SpeechDat - Car after cleaning up , maybe having more noise than the the training set of TIMIT after clean s after you do the noise clean - up . phd d: So it had like all these different conditions of S N Rs , actually in their training set of neural net . phd d: But after cleaning up you have now a different set of S N Rs , right ? phd c: Yeah . phd d: And is it something to do with the mismatch that that 's created after the cleaning up , like the high mismatch phd c: You mean the the most noisy occurrences on SpeechDat - Car might be a lot more noisy than phd d:   professor b: but , you 're saying Yeah , the noisier ones are still going to be , even after our noise compensation , are still gonna be pretty noisy . phd d: Yeah , so now the after - noise compensation the neural net is seeing a different set of S N Rs than that was originally there in the training set . phd d: And that SNR may not be , like , com covering the whole set of S N Rs that you 're getting in the SpeechDat - Car . professor b: Right , but the SpeechDat - Car data that you 're seeing is also reduced in noise by the noise compensation . phd c: Well , if the initial range of SNR is different , we the problem was already there before . phd c: Because Mmm professor b: Yeah , it depends on whether you believe that the noise compensation is equally reducing the noise on the test set and the training set .  professor b: Right ?  , you 're saying there 's a mismatch in noise that wasn't there before , phd d:  . professor b: but if they were both the same before , then if they were both reduic reduced equally , then , there would not be a mismatch . professor b: So , this may be Heaven forbid , this noise compensation process may be imperfect , but . I I just that could be seen from the TI - digits , testing condition because , the noises are from the TI - digits , right ? Noise phd c: Yeah . So phd d: So cleaning up the TI - digits and if the performance goes down in the TI - digits mismatch high mismatch like this phd c: Clean training , yeah . professor b: the Macrophone data , I think , you know , it was recorded over many different telephones . I don't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car , but I think it 's it 's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments , and playing around with it doesn't , make it better , the most  , it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set .   , what we were  the condition It it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with Meeting Recorder digits , even though there , again , these m Macrophone digits were very , very different from , what we were going on here . But it was just I think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing . phd c: Yeah , actually to s eh , what I observed in the HM case is that the number of deletion dramatically increases . phd c: When I added the num the neural network it doubles the number of deletions . Yeah , so I don't you know how to interpret that , but , mmm professor b: Yeah . phd c: t phd a: And and did an other numbers stay the same ? Insertion substitutions stay the same ? phd c: They p stayed the same , phd a: Roughly ? phd c: they maybe they are a little bit  , lower . But professor b: Did they increase the number of deletions even for the cases that got better ? phd c:   professor b: And it Remind me again , the \" highly mismatched \" means that the phd c: Clean training and professor b: sorry ? phd c: It 's clean training Well , close microphone training and distant microphone , high speed , I think . professor b: Close mike training phd c: Well The most noisy cases are the distant microphone for testing . phd c: The feature are the same except that professor b: that 's right , that 's right .  phd a: Well that that says that , you know , the ,  the models in in , the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features . professor b: But , yeah , actually the TIMIT noises are sort of a range of noises and they 're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises , right ? It 's it 's pretty different . \" phd c: \" Subway \" , right ? and phd d: \" Street \" or \" Airport \" or something . phd c: So it 's mostly Well , \" Car \" is stationary , professor b:   phd c: \" Babble \" , it 's a stationary background plus some voices , professor b:   professor b: Well , I I think that if you run it Actually , you maybe you remember this . When you in in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , with the the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ? phd c:   professor b: Was it about the same ?  , w i phd c: It was b a little bit worse . professor b: So , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net wasn't helping at all . as soon as we added LDA on - line normalization , and all these things , then professor b: They were doing similar enough things . Well , I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing . phd c: Yeah , professor b: And and the thing I I have in mind is , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . You know ? And ,  But if on the ha other hand , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and and and , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a of a , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow . professor b: If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on on , improving the the net . professor b: So what 's the overall effe  , you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ? But it 's but of course that one 's weighted lower , phd c: Y yeah , oh . That 's not that bad , but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car . phd d: Well , it will overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse , because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five point two five eight . So the so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four , phd d: Is it like professor b: and and , in fact since the others are somewhat better phd d: Yeah , so it 's four . Is i So either it 'll get cancelled out , or you 'll get , like , almost the same . phd a: In the ,  a lot of the ,  the Hub - five systems , recently have been using LDA . So there 's the the LDA is is right there before the H M phd d: Yeah . phd a: So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . The LDA that you saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , and then do an LDA on it , phd a: Yeah . phd a: it 's you know , you 're just basically i phd d: Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency high cost frequency . So it 's like more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r phd a: Ah . So what i what about ,  i u what i w  , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put ran the other kind of LDA , on your features right before they go into the  ? phd d: it phd c:   phd a: But  , w but the other features that you have , th the non - tandem ones , phd c:  . Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , but phd a:  - huh . professor b: The a the argument i is kind of i in and it 's not like we really know , but the argument anyway is that , we always have the prob  , discriminative things are good . professor b: they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . It PAC - PCA low - order PCA throws away pieces that are  , maybe not not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . professor b: But , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is is something else . professor b: And so , Stephane 's idea was , let 's feed , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , phd a: Yeah . professor b: and then , you you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that that doesn't have that , phd a:  - huh . And that that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the  , what , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature  , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he he when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was was it didn't help at all in this particular case . But by having them both there The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . professor b: And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , phd a: Right . professor b: and by combining two information sources if , you know if if phd a: So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that professor b: That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . professor b: and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA .  , we ,  we were getting ready to do the tandem , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , \" Well , yeah , that i you know th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have  , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . phd a: You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . professor b: or tha that 's a phd a: That 's what that 's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing . phd a: it everybody believes it , professor b: Oh , no it 's a g phd a: but you know , we just professor b: No , no , but it might not not even be true . professor b: it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea .  , one of the things that always disturbed me , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , a lot of people Because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , looking at all into the linear , versions of them . professor b: And , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , and You know , so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it . phd a: Yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their systems now , and so , I that 's what made me wonder about this , professor b: Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , phd a: but . professor b: but but but , phd a: Yeah , what  is it 's it 's like in the Hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , you know , LDA on their features . phd c: It 's the transformation they 're estimating on Well , they are trained on the same data as the final  are . Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that that you guys have . phd a: So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . professor b: part of why I I think part of why you were getting into the KLT Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , you know , getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? So you were just trying I think you r  , this is it doesn't have the LDA aspect but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? phd c:   phd d: So , yeah , I 've been exploring a parallel VAD without neural network with , like , less latency using SNR and energy , after the cleaning up . So what I 'd been trying was ,  After the b after the noise compensation , n I was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean . So that if if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech . And if it is n if it is close to zero , which is So it 's like a scale @ @ probability value . So I was trying , with full band and multiple bands , m ps  separating them to different frequency bands and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them .  , the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can professor b:   phd d: just like Which means that it 's it 's doing a slightly better job than the previous VAD , professor b:   phd d: so ,  professor b: But i d I 'm sorry , phd d: so u professor b: does it still have the median filter stuff ? phd d: It still has the median filter . professor b: So it still has most of the delay , phd d: So professor b: it just doesn't phd d: Yeah , so d with the delay , that 's gone is the input , which is the sixty millisecond . professor b: Well , w i phd d: At the input of the neural net you have this , f nine frames of context plus the delta . phd d: so the delay is only the forty millisecond of the noise cleaning , plus the hundred millisecond smoothing at the output . So the the di the biggest The problem f for me was to find a consistent threshold that works well across the different databases , because I t I try to make it work on tr SpeechDat - Car professor b:   phd d: and it fails on TI - digits , or if I try to make it work on that it 's just the Italian or something , it doesn't work on the Finnish . So there are there was , like , some problem in balancing the deletions and insertions when I try different thresholds . phd d: So The I 'm still trying to make it better by using some other features from the after the p clean up maybe , some , correlation auto - correlation or some s additional features of to mainly the improvement of the VAD . professor b: Now this this this , \" before and after clean \" , it sounds like you think that 's a good feature . That that , it you th think that the ,  the i it appears to be a good feature , right ? phd d:   phd c: Yeah , eventually we could could just phd d: Yeah , so Yeah , so that 's the Yeah . phd d: Because they did that itself phd c: Then you don't have to worry about the thresholds and phd d: There 's a threshold and Yeah . So if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere , then then that would be a , good thing . professor b: anybody has anybody you guys or or Naren , somebody , tried the , second th second stream thing ?  . phd d: Oh , I just I just h put the second stream in place and ,  ran one experiment , but just like just to know that everything is fine . phd d: So it was like , forty - five cepstrum plus twenty - three mel log mel . phd d: And and , just , like , it gave me the baseline performance of the Aurora , which is like zero improvement . phd d: So I just tried it on Italian just to know that everything is But I I didn't export anything out of it because it was , like , a weird feature set . Well , what I think , you know , would be more what you 'd want to do is is is , put it into another neural net . phd d: The  , other thing I was wondering was , if the neural net , has any because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net , where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional some four plus some f few more conditions which it hasn't seen , actually , phd c:   phd d:  instead of just h having c  , those cleaned up t cepstrum , sh should we feed some additional information , like The the We have the VAD flag .  , should we f feed the VAD flag , also , at the input so that it it has some additional discriminating information at the input ? phd c:  -  !  professor b: Wh -  , the the VAD what ? phd d: We have the VAD information also available at the back - end . phd d: So if it is something the neural net is not able to discriminate the classes professor b: Yeah . phd d:  Because most of it is sil  , we have dropped some silence f We have dropped so silence frames ? professor b:   So , by having an additional , feature which says \" this is speech and this is nonspeech \" , it certainly helps in some unseen noise conditions for the neural net . phd a: What Do y do you have that feature available for the test data ? phd d: Well , we have we are transferring the VAD to the back - end feature to the back - end . phd d: Which is which is certainly giving a phd a: So you 're saying , feed that , also , into the neural net . The other thing you could do is just , p modify the , output probabilities of the of the , neural net , tandem neural net , based on the fact that you have a silence probability . professor b: So you have an independent estimator of what the silence probability is , and you could multiply the two things , and renormalize . professor b: But but ,  phd c: Yeah , so maybe , yeah , when phd a: But in principle wouldn't it be better to feed it in ? And let the net do that ? professor b: Well , u Not sure . \" Or you can say , \" It 's silence ! Go away ! \"  , i Doesn't ? I think I think the second one sounds a lot more direct . So , what if you then ,  since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? professor b: Well , phd c: That 's what phd a: Well , I guess that 's the same . professor b: Yeah , y you 'd have to actually run it continuously , phd a: But   , train the net only on professor b: but it 's @ @ Well , no , you want to train on on the nonspeech also , because that 's part of what you 're learning in it , to to to generate , that it 's it has to distinguish between . phd a: But  , if you 're gonna if you 're going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision , would then you don't care about whether the net makes that distinction , right ? professor b: Well , yeah . Now the only thing that that bothers me about all this is that I I I The the fact i i It 's sort of bothersome that you 're getting more deletions . But So I might maybe look at , is it due to the fact that  , the probability of the silence at the output of the network , is , professor b: Is too high . So maybe So phd c: If it 's the case , then multiplying it again by i by something ? phd d: It may not be it professor b: Yeah . phd d: Yeah , it it may be too it 's too high in a sense , like , everything is more like a , flat probability . phd d: So , like , it 's not really doing any distinction between speech and nonspeech phd c: yeah . phd a: Be interesting to look at the Yeah , for the I wonder if you could do this . But if you look at the , highly mism high mismat the output of the net on the high mismatch case and just look at , you know , the distribution versus the the other ones , do you do you see more peaks or something ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: or professor b: But I bu phd c: It it seems that the VAD network doesn't Well , it doesn't drop , too many frames because the dele the number of deletion is reasonable . But it 's just when we add the tandem , the final MLP , and then professor b: Yeah . Now the only problem is you don't want to ta I guess wait for the output of the VAD before you can put something into the other system , phd c: u professor b: cuz that 'll shoot up the latency a lot , right ? Am I missing something here ? phd c: But phd d:   But but I I guess phd a: But if you were gonna put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net , right ? phd d: well . professor b: It 's kind of done in  , some of the things are , not in parallel , but certainly , it would be in parallel with the with a tandem net . So maybe , if that doesn't work ,  But it would be interesting to see if that was the problem , anyway . And and and then I guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you 're feeding into the VAD , and feeding it into the other one as well . professor b:  But that 's Yeah , that 's an interesting thing to try to see , if what 's going on is that in the highly mismatched condition , it 's , causing deletions by having this silence probability up up too high , phd c:   phd c: So , m professor b: Cuz Well , the V A if the VAD said since the VAD is is is right a lot ,  phd c: Yeah . Yeah , and the other thing Well , there are other issues maybe for the tandem , like , well , do we want to , w  n Do we want to work on the targets ? Or , like , instead of using phonemes , using more context dependent units ? phd a: For the tandem net you mean ? phd c: Well , I 'm Yeah . phd c: I 'm thinking , also , a w about Dan 's work where he he trained a network , not on phoneme targets but on the  state targets . professor b: Problem is , if you are going to run this on different m test sets , including large vocabulary , phd c: Yeah . I was just thinking maybe about , like , generalized diphones , and come up with a a reasonable , not too large , set of context dependent units , and and Yeah . But I d I d it it i it 's all worth looking at , phd c:   professor b: but it sounds to me like , looking at the relationship between this and the speech noise stuff is is is probably a key thing . phd a: So if ,  if the , high mismatch case had been more like the , the other two cases in terms of giving you just a better performance , how would this number have changed ? phd c:   If if i phd a: y Like sixty ? professor b: Well , we don't know what 's it 's gonna be the TI - digits yet . If you extrapolate the SpeechDat - Car well - matched and medium - mismatch , it 's around , yeah , maybe five . phd c: Well , it 's around five percent , because it 's s Right ? If everything is five percent . phd c: I d I d I just have the SpeechDat - Car right now , so phd a: Yeah . phd c: It 's running it shou we should have the results today during the afternoon , phd a:  . Well  So I won't be here for phd a: When When do you leave ? professor b: I 'm leaving next Wednesday .  , phd a: But you 're professor b: so I phd a: are you you 're not gonna be around this afternoon ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: This afternoon  Oh , right , for the Meeting meeting ? Yeah , that 's just cuz of something on campus . But , yeah , so next week I won't , and the week after I won't , cuz I 'll be in Finland .  , phd a: What 's September sixth ? professor b: and  , that 's during Eurospeech .  Right ? So it 'll be a few weeks , really , before we have a meeting of the same cast of characters . And and then  , we 'll start up again with Dave and Dave and Barry and Stephane and us on the , twentieth . Thirteenth ? About a month ? phd a: So , you 're gonna be gone for the next three weeks or something ? professor b: I 'm gone for two and a half weeks starting starting next Wed - late next Wednesday . Is that right ? professor b: I won't it 's probably four because of is it three ? Let 's see , twenty - third , thirtieth , sixth . And the the third one won't probably won't be a meeting , cuz cuz , Su - Sunil , Stephane , and I will all not be here . So it 's just , the next two where there will be there , you know , may as well be meetings , phd a: OK . And then starting up on the thirteenth , we 'll have meetings again but we 'll have to do without Sunil here somehow . phd a: When is the evaluation ? November , or something ? professor b: Yeah , it was supposed to be November fifteenth <doc-sep>phd a: And what was that , Morgan ? What project ? professor b: the , TORRENT chip . professor b: we went through it Jim and I went through old emails at one point and and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're we 're two months away from being done . phd a: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we go around and do , status report kind of things ? OK . phd a: Any objection ? Do y OK , M professor b: All in favor phd a: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or ? professor b: I don't do anything . I No , I I 'm involved in discussions with with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ? grad f: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ? phd a: OK . Well , this past week I 've just been , getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal . I just finished a section on ,  on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , as a as a middle step . And , I hope to hope to get this ,  a full rough draft done by , Monday so I can give it to Morgan . phd a: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and ? grad f: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . phd a: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any a little bit about it , grad f: Y s phd a: or ? Mmm .  , a little bit about ? phd a: Wh - what you 're what you 're gonna You said you were talking about the , particular features that you were looking at , grad f: Oh , the the phd a: or grad f: Right . Well , I was , I think one of the perplexing problems is , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away .  , build a system that , classifies these ,  these feat  , these intermediate categories using , multi - band techniques . Look at then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . phd a: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ? grad f: for that for that part of the the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT . grad f: that 's that 's ,  that 's just the ph the phone recognition task . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , something like Schw - Switchboard , where I 'd I would be able to ,  to model , intermediate categories that span across phonemes , phd a:   grad f: not just within the phonemes , themselves , and then do the same process there , on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard .  , and for that for that part I would I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for for Switchboard . phd a: It 's about a month from now ? grad f: It 's a it 's a month and and a week . phd a: So , you want to go next , Dave ? And we 'll do grad e: Oh . And , we we got an improvement , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , six percent to four point five percent , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , the near - mike performance worsened , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , wh why would that be , considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , with some input from , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts .  , first of all HTK sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't .  , so this ,  This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone , depending on the timing of the echo . So , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . professor b: I had another thought just now , which is , remember we were talking before about we were talking in our meeting about , this stuff that some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , getting rid of low - energy sections ?  , if you if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , and , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing .  , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , at n And , what if you did ?  , there 's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . professor b: And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing grad e:   professor b: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , very low or or near zero value .  , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are ,  grad e:  - huh . professor b: or pre - echoes , whichever they are are are , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them . professor b: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech . phd g: what is the reverberation time like there ? grad e: In thi in this room ?  phd g: On , the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like ? grad e: Y Yeah . professor b: so it 's these are just microphone this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on . I think it 's I would guess , point seven , point eight seconds f  , R T grad f:  ! professor b: something like that ? But it 's you know , it 's this room . But the other thing is , he 's putting in w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways . He 's also putting in , a he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't . professor b: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away .  , and if it 's a low energy compo portion , you might actually hear some funny things . grad e: O o one thing , I noticed is that , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them . I don't see why why your signal is louder after processing , because yo grad e: Yeah . professor b: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .  , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio . phd c: Well , well professor b: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . professor b: But just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio grad e: It w i i it wouldn't affect things . phd c: Well , the system is use the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on on the signal level . professor b: So if the if the if you change in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect . phd a: Did you add this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ? grad e:   . Did I w what ? phd a: Well , Morgan was just saying that , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect . But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder . If it 's if it 's like , if it 's trying to find a a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter .  , there 's there 's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing , grad e: Nuh - huh . phd a: I wonder if there could be something like ,  for s for the PZM data , phd c: Eh phd a: you know , if occasionally , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the ,  you know , doing the mean normalization where , it it could cause you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . It it i maybe i If ,  Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger . professor b: So , it 's it 's just a a question of there 's It it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it grad e:   professor b: y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . So , you trained it on TI - digits ? But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on Macrophone . Right ? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . grad e: If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system . So you use VTL -  , vocal tract length normalization and , like MLLR transformations also , grad e:   phd c: and professor b: I 'm sorry , was his point eight percent , er , a a result on testing on Macrophone or or training ? phd c: all that stuff . grad e: That 's phd c: It was training on Macrophone and testing yeah , on on meeting digits . I I 've just been text testing the new Aurora front - end with well , Aurora system actually so front - end and HTK , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . professor b: So , what w ? phd c: And phd g: With the with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ? phd c: Yeah . phd g: I know in the meeting , like phd c: On the meeting we have two point seven . phd c: we have the new LDA filters , and I think , maybe I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation .  , eh Do y did you have a look at at the meet  , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or ? grad e: I I didn't .  , any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it . professor b: typi you know , unless Actually , there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to DC . And you can get , I think it was I think it was in the Wall Street Journal data that that I can't remember , one of the DARPA things . professor b: we didn't we didn't know about for a while , while we were messing with it . And , the interesting thing that I tried was , Adam and Morgan had this idea , since my original attempts to , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work .  , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , problems with , the arithmetic of phases . They they add in this modulo two pi way and , there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct . So , what I did instead is I took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , and I subtracted that phase off to normalize . professor b: You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , and he 's really got something . phd a: Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ? professor b: Ex - exactly . phd g: Oh , it 's professor b: Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite . I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because this is also one big difference between the two systems .  , the other differences were the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more SRI system are more complex . But , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and phd a: It didn't seem to help in the HTK system . professor b: Well , it sounds like they also have he he 's saying they have all these , different kinds of adaptation . phd a: Like they do ,  I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits , phd c: The vocal tr phd a: but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's ,  conversation - side normalization for the non - C - zero components , phd c: Yeah . phd c: So , it might be it might be better with it might be worse if the channel is constant , phd a: Yeah . phd g: And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or or is it the whole word ? phd c: SRI it 's it 's tr grad f: SRI . So there 's there 's these kind of , pooled models and and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies . professor b: They have tied states and I think I I I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . And maybe see with Andreas if Well , I I don't know how much it helps , what 's the model . phd a: So so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ? phd c: That 's right . grad e: You know , the the Aurora baseline is set up with these ,  this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter , and , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which don't have this filter . professor b: So is that ?  , are are these results comparable ? So you you were getting with the , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent on clean TI - digits , when , training the SRI system with clean TR digits TI - digits . And , so , is your two point seven comparable , where you 're , using , the submitted system ? phd c: Yeah . grad e: W w it was one one point two phd c: Ye grad e: with the SRI system , professor b: I 'm sorry . professor b: OK , so the comparable number then ,  for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the  , two point f phd c: It was four point something . Right ? The HTK system with , b grad e: D d professor b: Oh , right , right , right , right . phd c: MFCC features grad e: Do you mean the b ? The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent . And another thing I I maybe would like to do is to just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone test it on , the noisy TI - digits , professor b: Yeah . But I wonder if it 's just because maybe Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than than TI - digit is , which is TI - digits are very clean recorded digits professor b:   phd c: and phd a: You know , it would also be interesting to see ,  to do the regular Aurora test , phd c: f s phd a: but use the SRI system instead of HTK . phd c: So we don't professor b: You 'd have to train the SRI system with with all the different languages . phd a: So , like , comple professor b: It 'd be a lot of work . phd a: I guess the work would be into getting the the files in the right formats , or something . phd a: Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're ,  you 're also training on all the data . professor b: That 's true , but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things phd a:   professor b: because on on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK . professor b: So , it 's it 's a good idea , but it seems like it makes sense to do some pruning phd a:   professor b: first with a a test or two that makes sense for you , phd a: Yeah . But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information about what 's going on .  , the next thing is this this VAD problem that ,  So , I 'm just talking about the the curves that I I sent I sent you so , whi that shows that when the SNR decrease , the current VAD approach doesn't drop much frames for some particular noises , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , acoustically . I They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries . First of all , the boundaries might be ,  like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or before and after speech . professor b: Do we ?  , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ? phd c: And No . professor b: But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when when , the gang gets back from Crete . professor b: And then the thing is if if they really are going to have some means of giving us fairly tight , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue . phd g: Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . And then , like , if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , the way we want professor b:   phd g: to find a  , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us . phd g: But if that is going to be something like a manual , segmenter , then we can't use that information anymore , phd c:   phd g: because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation . There 's an  , I think it 's still for even for the evaluation , it might still be interesting to work on this because the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , starting of speech and end of speech  , at the utterance level . phd c: So phd g: with some pauses in the center , provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking . professor b: So if you could get at some of that ,  phd c: So professor b: although that 'd be hard . It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other things that we want to work on . So I did I just started to test putting together two VAD which was was not much work actually .  , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , energy - based VAD that , the other Aurora guys use . phd c: and , detect detecting the first group of four frames that have a energy that 's above this threshold , and , from this point , tagging the frames there as speech . And it really removes it , still o on the noises where our MLP VAD doesn't work a lot . phd c: professor b: Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral information , phd c: and professor b: you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance  , would give you some better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or or ,  stop consonants , or something like that . So , your point is will be to u use whatever professor b: Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and nonspeech . professor b: just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , some sort of slope . And and most , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a a high - pass kind of characteristic phd c:   professor b: you know , at the beginning of a of a of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy , phd c:   Whereas , a a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency .  , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , but it plus energy is sort of phd c: Yeah . professor b: if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of what they were using then . It it might be that what I did is so , removes like low ,  low - energy , speech frames . Because the way I do it is I just I just combine the two decisions so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based with the with the and operator . So if the energy - based dropped dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they they are they are lost . phd c: But s still , the way it 's done right now it it helps on on the noises where it seems to help on the noises where our VAD was not very good . But but , I guess what you 're saying is that the the MLP - based one has the spectral information . professor b: Well , you can imagine phd c: The way I use a an a \" AND \" operator is So , it I ,  professor b: Is ? phd c: The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are are , dropped , even if the , MLP decides to keep them . phd a: No professor b: but  , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a  , a probability estimated by each one and and put them together . phd a: Something that that I 've used in the past is ,  when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . phd a: But , I 'm I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . phd c: Well , actually if I don't maybe don't want to work too much of on it right now . I just wanted to to see if it 's what I observed was the re was caused by this this VAD problem .  , which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , twenty - five experiments , with different , values for the parameters that are used . So , it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more , noise than the noise spectra that is estimated on the noise portion of the s  , the utterances . And after subtraction , I also add a constant noise , and I also try different , noise , values and we 'll see what happen . But st still when we look at the ,  Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . On the other hand , when you subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but maybe you distort a lot of speech . So the next thing , maybe I what I will try to to do is just to try to smooth mmm , the ,  to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or phd g: Can smooth the SNR estimate , also . So , to get something that 's would be closer to what you tried to do with Wiener filtering . phd c: It phd g: And it 's phd c: Maybe you can phd g: go ahead . And there are there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was I was assuming that always the VAD  , the initial frames were silence . So the it wasn't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence . phd c: So , in some cases s there are also phd g: SpeechDat - Car Italian . And , so once it was cleared , I ran a few experiments with different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the the trend seems to be like , smoothing the current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the estimating the the More smoothing is helping . And , so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So , one is fixed in the line , like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , SNR , because that if some In some cases the clean speech is , like when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't vary a lot in the low - energy regions . The results are , like So far I 've been testing only with the baseline , which is which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , just the spectral  , the mel sp mel , frequency coefficients . And the other thing that I tried was but I just took of those , Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . And it 's it seems to be like it 's not hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a four hertz a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So there must be something that I can that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which I guess I would ask Carlos about that .  , how how he derived those filters and and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll professor b: This is cubic root of power spectra ? phd g: Yeah . professor b: So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . phd g: So it has , like the spectrogram has , like  , it actually , enhances the onset and offset of  , the the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions , professor b:   phd g: So , those are the regions where there are , like when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . There are a few very not a lot of because the filter doesn't have a really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll I 'll Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and but while making this Wiener filter better . professor b: last week you were also talking about building up the subspace stuff ? phd g: Yeah . I I I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . phd a: How about you , Carmen ? phd d: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy . professor b:  ? phd d: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then we decided that that 's it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . I don't hav I don't this is I didn't do the experiment yet to apply VTS in cepstral domain . professor b: The other thing is So so , in i i and Not and C - zero would be a different So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway .  , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have two kinds of normalization with with , different time constants . So , you could do some normalization s  , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . phd d: Well , we s decide to m to to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot It 's a lot of work . phd d: And I want to know if if we have some feeling that the result I I would like to know if I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel in filter bank domain . Well , you 're I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . phd c: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the level of the speech signal . phd d: Yeah ? phd c: And So I expect it If if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to it to , be a better model of speech . And then you have one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level , phd d:   phd d: Ye phd c: Because it 's like first doing general normalization phd d: Yea phd c: and then noise removal , which is phd d: Yeah . We I was thinking to to to estimate the noise with the first frames and then apply the VAD , professor b:   phd d: We we see Well , I am thinking about that and working about that , professor b: Yeah .  , one of the things we 've talked about maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their characteristics are , phd d:  -  "

        "Query": "What were the key points discussed by the group regarding the style, design optimization, design goal, evaluation criteria, features, and use cases of the remote control?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the integration of remote controls for different appliances into one, but Marketing raised concerns about the excessive number of buttons and suggested incorporating a menu display instead. The Project Manager and User Interface agreed, but insisted on keeping basic buttons as well. However, the idea of a flip top was rejected due to cost considerations. As a temporary solution, lightweight plastic was chosen as the material. The team aimed to create an original, trendy, user-friendly, durable, creative, and characteristic remote control that would be intuitive for users. They also determined the price, cost, and expected profit of the remote control. Creativity was emphasized, with the goal of introducing fashion into electronics without compromising functionality. Marketing emphasized the need for a fashionable, technologically innovative, easy-to-use, customer-friendly, uncomplicated, functional, and ergonomically-friendly remote control. The Project Manager agreed and added that it should be quick to learn how to use. User Interface highlighted the importance of channel switching and suggested keeping the remote control as basic as possible. Marketing proposed that the remote control should be multipurpose to compete with existing products. The Project Manager agreed to explore innovative use cases and suggested operating different devices such as TVs, video recorders, and DVD players with the remote control.",
        "Article": "I don't know if  if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart , marketing: My name's Frank . They'll record  our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice .  there are also some microphones there but th  you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will  disappear when you don't attend to it . So is there a project documents folder ? There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . Well I don't know if you've noticed , but  we're working for Real Reaction . We put fashion in electronics ,  we make it work ,  we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . marketing: project manager:  maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or Let's see . project manager: I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just  if you hear something  you can write down , just write it down . No ? user interface:  ? marketing: Can't say I paid much attention to it , project manager: I can see if it works this way . project manager: Real Remote is not really the company we're we are , but it's just a little fault . project manager:  okay , what are we going to do ?  our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design ,  components design and a bit of the look and feel design .  the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project  product ev evaluation . We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . N  these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little  piece of drawing . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page  in the think it is form of . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . marketing: project manager:  the only thing we have to  look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then  the pen won't hold up . user interface: project manager: These are not very much , but   , see you have to do it real slow . project manager: Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin , user interface: project manager: but I think his nose has to be a little bit marketing: user interface: project manager: But it's close . I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . project manager: Is your cat , or did you find him on the street ? industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: Well , it's supposed to be a cat . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask marketing: Yeah . marketing: project manager:  as you can see , we  for our remote control , a selling price is  twenty five Euros .  that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims .  we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Our production cost  can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million  , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . marketing: So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? user interface:  ? project manager:  maybe you have to say the magic word . But so  does everybody has  experiences with  remote controls , and  not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? marketing: user interface:  . marketing: Well , we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . marketing: And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . And you can  program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . project manager: And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . marketing: Oh project manager: So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor .  but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . project manager: And other functions for a remote control ? Maybe we can make it   user interface: user interface: you never no know  , marketing: So user interface: I w   project manager: Waterproof . But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . project manager: No ? user interface: project manager: Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work <doc-sep>Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and  it looks like we've  done a good job here and  we'll just go through the the final  the final details .  okay , oh the  th the the minutes of the last meeting  I think we'll take those as read ,  Okay industrial designer: project manager: the  th the the next  thing we we we'll have a look at the  th have a look at the prototypes and  look at the  evaluation criteria and finance and then   just tidy up with production and  and then we can close . industrial designer:  okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just  you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically .  on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . project manager: industrial designer:  this is the power key ,  it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , project manager: Yep , industrial designer: or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . industrial designer: so you can you know talk to it like that project manager: Yep , industrial designer: and it'll still understand . industrial designer: and has the cover on it user interface: S industrial designer: and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything project manager: Yep , yep , industrial designer: and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . user interface: And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , project manager: -huh . user interface: and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , project manager: showing me age , user interface: so they kinda just stretch over . user interface: I I didn't know that but yeah they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery project manager: -huh . user interface: and that way you know project manager: Okay , user interface: spongy like is something that people wanted project manager: yep , right . user interface: and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well project manager: Okay . industrial designer: But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers user interface: and industrial designer: you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . user interface: and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . project manager:  tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered  h how will people put these down I wonder ? user interface: Like that . Okay for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically industrial designer: Yeah it could stand , yeah . industrial designer: Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit project manager: Yeah ,  no industrial designer: so it would stand like that . project manager: because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item industrial designer: Yeah , standing . project manager:   it it's  it it's just  it's just a minor detailed point , but  as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and  industrial designer: Yeah , we could just widen it out  project manager: Yeah and  it just needs another  another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them  industrial designer:  . project manager: because actually have several upon the  marketing: Could have one for your stereo , one for your D_V_ player . industrial designer: Have to if we just lengthen it I guess project manager: Yeah industrial designer: so it comes down to the base of the hand user interface: Yeah , project manager: but that that's  but  user interface: just kind of industrial designer: and then flatten it out project manager: no industrial designer: and could sit there . user interface: Somewhere like that project manager: no no ,  that's these  user interface: so it just sort of industrial designer: We might have to lengthen it marketing: Yeah I kinda had a a kinda a natural kind of a idea industrial designer: so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , user interface: Yeah . marketing: where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , user interface: Bu project manager: Yeah . marketing: yeah , kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant project manager: But  yeah but no th but the yeah the the the industrial designer:  . project manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah , industrial designer: The final product would actually stand up , yeah . project manager: I think the  the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and the i industrial designer: Wee project manager: it certainly meets our criteria of being  of you know looking different . industrial designer: project manager:  right let us  What's on the next one ? Oh right yes , let's have a look at the  f finance .  , now we're given a a clear design brief ,  if I get the  spreadsheet up . Good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the  the the the boss can understand . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: Now I've  this is the company's   costing for for various   aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly  liberally given the constraints placed on us ,  I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour .  , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that  we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I  I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so ,  that I don't think is a a serious problem . The  the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay .  then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to   l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept  we we should exceed the the sales targets .  it's simply made of plastic so th that's  that's no problem and   just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's   there's some cost there .  and  we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple   slider so  and the and the the buttons are   well I do don't know that they're special colour . Anyway the the costings  come in at exactly on target at twelve point five  but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that  what what we've got is is so in innovative and  and different that  any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the  you know the  you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers industrial designer:  . project manager: so   you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative  that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within  the constraints that they give , industrial designer:  . project manager: so  we we we present this as the  the company's  the the company's way forward and   I I think we can argue that we we have  come in on on budget . Does anybody want to   Andrew do you want what do you want to say about  the  yeah the evaluation marketing: Evaluation . project manager: where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ? marketing: The the product or the project ? project manager: The the the well the I meant the product . Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . So what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard project manager: marketing:  gauge our team response to these questions . And then at the end just take an average project manager: Tr On for true and seven for flase . marketing: Easy to use ? project manager: I don't see we could've made it any easier . And  , what else ? The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , project manager: Less buttons so it must be . We we industrial designer: Yeah marketing:  yeah it was our it was a industrial designer: it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . marketing:  will device appeal to all age groups ? project manager: I think it will because   old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so industrial designer:  . Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . project manager: well I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so industrial designer: I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups marketing:  . industrial designer: and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but  I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . project manager: It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's  industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah I think just the simplicity of it project manager: yeah yeah industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . user interface: and project manager: so I I yeah I user interface: not having to learn to programme industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , industrial designer:  . marketing: project manager: why not ? industrial designer: user interface: marketing:  can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ?  , yeah and what h did we make the management's project manager: in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions  is that yes it it meets the requirement industrial designer: project manager: is t it's television only , industrial designer: Yep . project manager:  it's it's it's within budget , user interface: Under the cost . project manager: coming up with what marketing: So  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . project manager: Before I  industrial designer: user interface: Ps I don't think so , project manager: No . user interface: and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make project manager: Yeah . user interface: and come to group consensus and project manager: Well that's right ,  th this this slide here  the satisfaction with  room for creativity ,  industrial designer:  . project manager: I think we've allowed ourselves  as much creativity as the  the the the product  allows . project manager:  I won't comment on leadership ,  teamwork I think we've  I think everybody's  worked pretty well together . project manager:  we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens ,  I think the results speak for itself industrial designer:  . project manager: and new ideas found , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very  very effectively come up with a a new  user interface: Yeah . Is the project evaluated ? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria ,  industrial designer: Yep . project manager: Thank you very much indeed , I think that I think that's  industrial designer: Cool , thank you , user interface: Alright <doc-sep>project manager:  before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in ,  because we're  being watched by  Big Brother . And  as I can see you  you have placed your laptops  exactly on the place where it must be . And that has to do with the camera settings , so we don't have our  laptops in front of the cameras . So  what are we going  to  to do ? What are we going to   make f  kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design .  because at the detailed design , how , part two ,  we go  to dig in  really about how the the te the technical of If it's  it's possible technical-wise . marketing: project manager:  each stage is   is broken up in two  two stages , individual work and a meeting . This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you  you had .  This  is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't  gonna explain it all , marketing: project manager: because I think you know  how it works . Every  every one of us  must draw our favourite animal , industrial designer: project manager: and  tell  tell us why we  had  chosen that animal . project manager: Yes ? marketing:  this exercise ,  did the company board tell you to do it , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: or  did you just make it up yourself ? project manager: No no no . So getting used to each other , we can  have a little fun then , before we  dig in really to the hard stuff . marketing: project manager: My favourite animal huh ? industrial designer: marketing: It's like Pictionary ? industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , you can guess what it is . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: It's a pork ? project manager: No , it's not an orc . user interface: project manager: You don't see it  at the ears ? marketing:  yeah , I have it at home . industrial designer: marketing: Miniature size ? project manager: So we  found it kinda cool to  name it after a lion . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: project manager: So choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a user interface: You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during  the drawing . industrial designer: By the way , why was your cat  red ? project manager: Because  my cat is red  at home . project manager: user interface: Huh ? industrial designer: user interface: Oh , it is a turtle . project manager: You watched it a lot ? user interface: industrial designer: marketing:  ? project manager: You watched it a lot ? user interface: It's  inside its shell .  marketing: industrial designer: user interface: How did it work ? project manager: Format ? And then you have the the current colour , user interface: Performance ? project manager: you can change . marketing: project manager: Tim had  Tim , what kinda line width did you have ? user interface:  marketing:  the big lines were like nine . Why a dog ? You have a dog at home ? user interface: Well , we had a dog , a few years ago . project manager: Had a dog ? marketing: it's p project manager: Yeah ? user interface: And and it , yeah , when it died we didn't get a new one or something . user interface: But  marketing: It's pretty good  industrial designer: project manager: You have an artistic  inner middle . marketing: Wha user interface: Well , project manager: Okay , user interface: it's okay . user interface: industrial designer: I figure I should do something like that , project manager: industrial designer: but I'm gonna do something much more difficult . user interface: Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there  . But at the other hand ,  a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and project manager: No . user interface: Than on the , with project manager: user interface: Yeah , I m  like  like on here , drawing drawing  . user interface: marketing: Project Manager ?  project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: Where does the pen go ? Just  marketing: Have you been  counting the time ? project manager: Yeah , a little . project manager:  the selling price for the remote will be  twenty five Euro , and the production cost  may not be more than  twenty and a half Euro . So  from my point of view , I don't think it's  gonna be very  very high tech , high definition ,  ultra modern  kinda remote , for twelve  fift  twelve and a half Euro . We have to sell  a lot of  user interface: Yeah , how much is it ? marketing: Like how much ? user interface: Hundred million  remotes or something ? project manager:  I think  w when the selling price is twenty five ,   you got two million , two million remotes . Well what what's the most  important thing at a remote control ? user interface:  well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . So not a not a remote control who   which can  can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only marketing: Yeah . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ? project manager: If you have them on  I can  marketing: Yeah . Between the the the , yeah , the the  user interface: marketing: Screen ? project manager: Yeah , be The screens . user interface: Is it possible to open pen drawings in this  on this screen ? project manager: No no no . Only All the drawings go there , at the left  user interface:  but  which The ones we made on the project manager: Oh , that pen drawings .  no , I think  when it is  in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there .  I think , it doesn't have to matter  which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . marketing: And  by making it multi-purpose , it  has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from  from current products .  I rather find it very annoying  , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . It's nice as an added feature feature , that  , when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen  what programmes are coming up or project manager: Okay . project manager: remote ? Yeah , it must be really  innovative , technical-wise ? marketing: Yeah , it has to be  Yeah , our company is very  good in making new innovative  things . user interface: We marketing: So i i i i project manager: So we must focus on things who are really  really add something to  to marketing: To the current market . But we have to keep an eye that it's  at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very  cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . project manager:  but we must not  lose  sight of the the user   friendly  marketing: Yeah , of course . So  you  will have  individual actions where I presume  will be some feedback ,  via the m the mail .  one thing  , project manager: Yeah ? user interface: we must first agree on  what we're going to m going to make . Do we Are we going to use  it it for multiple systems ? Or  We should have some agreement on that before we project manager: Okay .  wha marketing:   I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . But maybe , because  you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we  must  have a little or kinda    How do you call it ?  user interface: Consensus on the , what we're gonna do . So you don't   come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . project manager: W He says user interface: if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . user interface: Or do we use it a text screen ? Or  will it be with  with bluetooth or project manager: Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say  is it   one way or multi-purpose , that's a user interface: Okay . marketing: Like we all have a list of  things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . project manager: each individually i individually  must think on what's  at  his point of view is the most important <doc-sep>project manager: Are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: So we've got both of these clipped on ? She gonna answer me or not ? project manager: Yeah , I've got marketing: Right , both of them , okay . project manager:  I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . Okay , this is our agenda ,  we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .  then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything  and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand .  , we want it to be original , something that's  people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , first is the functional design ,  this is where we all go off and do our individual work ,  what needs need to be fulfilled by the product ,  what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that .  , conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and  sum up the characteristics of that animal . I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . Where did this come from ? project manager: Is that your lapel then ? user interface: yep .  , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ? marketing: A kind of dog ? project manager: user interface: Yep . It's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . marketing: Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little , project manager: industrial designer: Alright , okay . industrial designer: Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random . project manager: Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is  marketing: user interface:  . project manager: industrial designer: Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be project manager: industrial designer: because that looks like a beak now , so . Is it gonna be marketing: user interface: industrial designer: Well it was it was an at first project manager: it's gonna be a bird . industrial designer: firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican marketing: O industrial designer: but it can be a crocodile now actually .  marketing: Beauti that's industrial designer:  scary ,  strong , yeah that's about it I think .  , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills , industrial designer:   marketing: mine's are dreadful . industrial designer: Wo marketing: I hope that clicks in , I'll just I'll hold it on , okay . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: Oops , oh dear , what happened there ? project manager: Technical help . marketing: Okay ,  Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too ,  . industrial designer: Okay , some sort of bird marketing: That's my dreadful that's the worst yet , that's it's meant to be an eagle project manager: A seagu user interface: Eagle , okay . marketing: you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . marketing: Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ? project manager: Eagle . industrial designer: marketing: I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing .  finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . Any ideas ? industrial designer: It's about user interface: One point four or something like that . industrial designer: so that project manager: D fifteen ? industrial designer: yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that . marketing: Should we be making notes of this ? We can just refer to this later can't we ? project manager: I think so , I think so , industrial designer: But project manager: I'll be able to  pull it up , marketing: Yeah , okay . industrial designer: Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . I think marketing: so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? project manager: Yeah ,  production cost's at twelve fifty , so industrial designer:  . project manager: which is  marketing: In our first year ? project manager: Yi yes ,  yeah , I presume so . user interface: So then marketing: You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a  accessible and usable by sort of all age groups project manager: marketing: just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone project manager: No , yeah . project manager: yes , yes , I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that ,  making that a key point , marketing: No . project manager: just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . What are your experiences with remote controls ?  I've got we got  we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up user interface: project manager: so we got one of the universal remote controls ,  that you programme each of your things into , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: that c project manager: but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it , industrial designer: Yeah  . project manager: but that was quite good , the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . user interface: Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: 'cause you marketing: My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and   videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , project manager:  . marketing: I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . project manager: Yeah , the main that's the main stuff anyway ,  marketing: project manager: and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do marketing:  . When they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . project manager: 'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , marketing:  . marketing: Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , user interface: marketing: I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus . user interface: And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . project manager: What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ? user interface: You mean to save it lesser number . project manager: my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . project manager: I don't think they tape things , industrial designer: Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so project manager: I don't think they use marketing: Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , project manager: yeah , the age gap . industrial designer: Yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause  , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . project manager: I don't know , I d industrial designer: But I don't know how project manager: I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . project manager: I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but  my friend got a new one marketing: Right . project manager: and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me . industrial designer: Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , marketing: project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? user interface: Okay . marketing: Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things marketing: project manager: and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . S project manager: I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about industrial designer: Y user interface: It might marketing: Yeah ? user interface: it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . marketing: And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? project manager:  . project manager: right , okay industrial designer: No   project manager: we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things .  I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation . industrial designer: about what you're saying about the  does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the  we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui marketing: Ah right . industrial designer: and it'd look quite good but marketing: But yeah ,  it doesn't have to be that , you know th that was my main point , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , project manager:  . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , marketing: Right <doc-sep> and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the appearance, materials, and desired features of the television remote.",
        "Summary": "The company recommends incorporating its corporate colors and design into the product, including the option for different colors like pink or banana yellow and fun shapes such as animals. They also discussed the idea of using buttons with various shapes, like triangles for volume and squares for channels. It was agreed upon that the text on the remote should be clear and the remote itself should be compact. \n\nDuring the discussion, the group realized that balancing the budget and maintaining quality would be challenging. To save costs without compromising user experience, the Project Manager decided to use high-quality recycled plastic as the material for the remote. However, they were willing to invest in a cutting-edge lithium battery for optimal performance.\n\nThe company's slogan and design target revolve around incorporating fashion into electronics. While the idea of providing user-customizable skins was rejected due to the amount of work involved, they decided to add the company logo on the boot-up screen and introduce a dormant mode. This was because most people prefer a non-flashing remote when the TV is on.\n\nThere were two main reasons behind these design choices. Firstly, the unit price of each remote control was relatively high, at twenty-five Euros. To justify this price point, the features of the remote had to be satisfying and of high quality. Secondly, there was competition in the market from other TV remote controls. Therefore, the new remote controls needed to be special and different in order to attract customers.",
        "Article": "So  basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly  some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this  remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations  on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically  what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else , marketing: Okay . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that  in this particular design . So basically  given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later  'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our   well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer  to go ahead and make a presentation on industrial designer: Okay .  sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip ,  and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and  accordingly the messages as well . So my findings ,  I just did a preliminary study here and  I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands .  too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . Just some ideas that I had , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup .  the user interface , I was since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . industrial designer: The chip , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect .  , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means . marketing: industrial designer:  PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and  probably a two hundred foot range .  personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits marketing: Fine . industrial designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , project manager: Is is there a way that we can use  modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics industrial designer: 'cause we were thinking project manager: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value  like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , industrial designer: Right . project manager: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ? industrial designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem .  for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .  if next we can have the  User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .  we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal  and possibly  operate several different types of devices although we now  find that  that that's no problem .  that would be any number of different things  such as switch on the television ,  switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite  quite  intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does .  now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well project manager: Oh yeah look at that . user interface: but  this remote control has many functions  so it can do a lot of things but it  it is quite complicated project manager: user interface: and most users will find it  find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control  many less buttons but  has many fewer functions ,  m much easier for the user to manipulate and use .  so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display  for the user to to work with . project manager: 'Kay marketing: Does that mean I'm up ? project manager: yep that's you .  basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices .  pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic .  and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . And  we also found out that  fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people .  there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , industrial designer: marketing: and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . So  marketing: Need to unplug this ? project manager: yep I'll just  switch that back here . project manager: I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . project manager: Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this  through you guys's presentations  we've got  y the Industrial Designer suggests  or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic .  Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions  but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , marketing: Oh right . project manager:  so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is  we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look  we are putting the fashion in electronics  . marketing: We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so . project manager:  we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster  think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about  revolutionising the way it's looking  , marketing: Right . project manager: which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly . How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea  assuming that it's doable ,  at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . project manager: Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ industrial designer: project manager: but we might be able to say  volume up . marketing: Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ? industrial designer: Oh yeah I think that's very doable . project manager: The difficulty wh would be in  I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . project manager: If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . user interface: finds your marketing: K project manager: Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing marketing: Yeah . project manager: but yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . user interface: The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . user interface: And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k marketing: Making it just an option ? industrial designer:  . user interface: exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . The  if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? project manager: marketing: 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have project manager:  . marketing: menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for . industrial designer: Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . user interface: industrial designer: It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip .  'kay  well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge  in a la slightly later stages of development  but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question .  'kay  so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned   remote control . project manager:  I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it  I don't think there's too many , marketing:  . project manager: we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many  . Right  we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? user interface:  I'm not sure that's sincerely correct , project manager: Okay . user interface: I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that  trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? That's something I w for say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up . industrial designer: And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . project manager: it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . marketing: Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home , project manager: user interface: Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house project manager: industrial designer: marketing: True . project manager: Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about  whether th when we do costs and so forth ,  . project manager: True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway  yeah we'll cross that bridge later  but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important .  I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ? user interface: Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a  touch screen  project manager: Yeah yeah okay . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or  b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea .  And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus  for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen .  do we have  wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . marketing: industrial designer: user interface: So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ? project manager: Do they ? Okay . industrial designer: Can we afford to include one of those ? marketing: Can we afford that ? user interface: marketing: And will somebody buy it if we don't ? industrial designer: project manager: Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . project manager: Okay so let's go with a  touch screen with  some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology marketing: For twelve Euros ? user interface: project manager: Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple marketing: It is . project manager: you can put the we could I I dunno  I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu  w we'll do the aesthetics . project manager:  it's th  with this voice recognition option as well  just as for the simple functions the  the on off , channels , volume ,  industrial designer: Right . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging . project manager:  right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this . industrial designer: Since we're doing  touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . industrial designer: What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and  marketing: And oh . project manager: W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . marketing: Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and project manager: Yeah I think perhaps industrial designer: 'S too much . project manager: I think that that one m might just be  and they just yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular marketing: For now . project manager: a P_D_A_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but I dunno , what do you guys think ? industrial designer: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .  I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get  we put fashion into electronics onto this device . Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading project manager:  . marketing: Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think . user interface: I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there . industrial designer: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .  and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . Kind of if i user interface: Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of  putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . marketing: We're good ? project manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference <doc-sep>project manager: Okay , is everybody ready ? industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you . marketing: Okay ? project manager:  I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do industrial designer:  ? user interface: Yes . project manager: marketing: Well , could you  put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if  we looked at the slides at the same time . marketing: so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide . Right well  since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it . marketing:  I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that  in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions . You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should  turn on your C_D_ whatever you want it to do industrial designer: 'Kay . marketing:  and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to  design and budget feasibility . So I'll be coming to you  frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . marketing: So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to  to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those . marketing: So that was  what I meant there , and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present . Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , industrial designer:  . marketing: we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee I just gotta have that . So it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by September , 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas . marketing:  and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of  of the features and of the the look and the colour user interface: Okay . marketing: and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . marketing: So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you , industrial designer:  marketing: and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know , user interface: What features . marketing: what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , user interface: S sellable . industrial designer: marketing: A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever . marketing: Okay can we go to the next slide please ? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the  the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything . project manager: marketing: I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set  maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp . project manager:  okay , can can I at this point interject  something ? marketing: I have to wind up ? Yeah , sure .  the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , marketing: Okay . project manager: and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_ , marketing: project manager: mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to  to to include other things , industrial designer: Complicated , yeah , of course . project manager:  and the marketing: Okay , so that's something project manager: and the third thing that they wanna make sure  that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . project manager: So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with  with the things we wanna look at . These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate  these things , so it's only gonna be T_V_ , marketing: Okay so project manager: but the one thing maybe that could be  eliminated is the teletext  idea .  alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room .  so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address ,  we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it  obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as  maybe a beep , and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . 'Kay can we go to the next slide please ? Okay , so , my personal preferences in this  project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle .  because once there's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back . industrial designer: marketing: If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead . You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros . So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say ,  twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that .  and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . project manager: And you are number three ? industrial designer: Number two , project manager: Number two . industrial designer: The metal is like  in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to  like  switch connec connect connect your remote controller to  power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . It should be a battery because   remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then   th marketing: industrial designer: this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a T_V_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like  th the remote controller it sends some bits some  waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . It should re re recognise the  waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then  the remote  remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , marketing: Signal . industrial designer: and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control user interface: Receive . project manager: Yo and it's marketing: Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook . So  user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . So  you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to  mute  mute the  T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the  in  integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions . industrial designer: So I I just would like to  add some extra features to the remote controller  I think these are the very simple features and  they don't take much   much of the   investment also , marketing: industrial designer: it's like el the text or buttons which  which are there on the  remote controller they those we can make   like fluorescent  they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . industrial designer: And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . And there should be a child lock , like   you should be able to lock your remote controller so that   whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible project manager: Yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now . And  different shapes that we can do like  we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable  whi which can fit into your hands project manager: industrial designer: and  so that  marketing: Now that's good from a marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah and colours also , different colours , and project manager: Yeah I user interface: - colours . marketing: And that you you say that won't add too much to the budget ? industrial designer: No no no , it won't  I don't think it will be like , marketing: To d the shape is  industrial designer: you can have you know for  if you want ther there to be more project manager: It just build a mould basically and  you know . project manager: As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Do you think there's any chance of  having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ? industrial designer: Yeah that is also possible I  yeah I I yeah . project manager: I think we will have to look at the budget on that industrial designer: Yeah that will be project manager: but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun , you know . marketing: Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of industrial designer: marketing: silly for children project manager: Like an animal or marketing: or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is . industrial designer: And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , so I think  we need to make some buttons which are which are like   f in  in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so . Well , I think I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss  with the User Interface person user interface: Yes . marketing: because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . marketing:  you and I , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: changing modes is nothing for us , but people who project manager: Yeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know , marketing: N and project manager: and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly industrial designer: project manager: you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else industrial designer: Yeah , yes . marketing: And that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel , and  you don't feel the mode change . marketing: You know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can  develop a tactile sense of it . industrial designer: yeah , and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and  marketing: That's right , yeah . project manager: industrial designer: And  display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's marketing: Yeah , that's that's a good that's a good one , project manager: - , industrial designer: Yeah , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so project manager: Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other  user interface: Yes . marketing: and Yeah , and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . industrial designer:  components  the main components we need for  it ha like buttons and  underneath that there should be switch . Like  we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or  whenever the T_V_ is on suppose , user interface:  . industrial designer: Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source , not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . industrial designer: chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , project manager: And   of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .  I have referred the site  the homepage of the  our website ,  from where I have   I got s few points . marketing: So it  we should visit this site and have a look at  what's up there ? Or industrial designer:  . industrial designer:  it's not like that , I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so . Could you go back to that slide where she had that  s slide up Betsy ? industrial designer: it's actually there now , there on the screen . Would you want it full full screen ? user interface: I can make it full ? Yes yes yes . As  User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . user interface: So I found out that  but  the main purpose of a remote is to  f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . Now for that ,  a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_ . user interface: There should be a signal  something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to  change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . user interface: Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a  a particular programme according to the user choice . So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time . user interface: So he can use that kind of   properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular  for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel . user interface: And  the  the  and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . user interface:  t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television . And   as   this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability . user interface: And  and  and it is one more point which I noted it down , like  the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to  ad adult person . user interface: And it should have an  it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , industrial designer:  . user interface: and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote . user interface: and as John Reece said the buttons can be ,  can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different  buttons will glow differently . So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . And   the design of the   remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he  he should not be harmed in any way . user interface: And findings ,  I found out  y  on different sites that  there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are  So  there you have different  types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . Not ,  no  like it can it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity  there should not be  much s move  lots of circuits and all that . And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it . industrial designer: It's like a t okay , it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television . project manager:  okay , now I have On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda , and  on the closing  basically there will be lunch break and all that . project manager: Yeah , and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_ . Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups . We have we have earlier it was mentioned about  for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , user interface: project manager:  then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything  unless it's really very clear . project manager: And  I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . project manager: So this these are just some thoughts I have on it , and  I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing marketing: project manager: or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different  buttons  for different groups . marketing: So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children  the mummy please mummy please  you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it  that has  a lot of marketing pull . user interface: project manager: That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but I think  I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups . project manager: You know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever you know user interface: Different colours . project manager: Do we look at one target group ? And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have  I'm asking the technical people here whether  to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ? user interface: marketing: Respect . No  generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with  f age from ten to  forty project manager: Right . user interface: and and then we can add on  specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes . industrial designer: We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know . project manager: Well that's that's user interface: But in a family in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes . user interface: They would like to buy just one and  just one which can be used all the three  industrial designer: Yeah of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know . marketing: What about the electronics ? That's not really gonna change much , is it ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: No marketing: That that w that won't change much , will it  ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , marketing: I d I wouldn't think so . project manager: and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups . project manager: The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . project manager: but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say  forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example . project manager: So that remains to s to be seen but  the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_ . marketing: and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? project manager: Yeah , well that's that's the question . marketing: And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ? industrial designer:  no . marketing:  you as an industrial person ? project manager: Well maybe there's there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ? marketing: project manager: They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , marketing: Yeah . project manager: that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example  you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have  another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package . project manager: You know , industrial designer: Yeah , like for mobile phones we have  different you know covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that . project manager: and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , marketing:  yeah . project manager: then they can go to the store and for a few  Francs or Euros whatever they can buy industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: But  yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the  different features for different people or designing three different  remotes for three different categories of people . project manager: Well I think I think the idea here is to  to to d design one remote industrial designer: Yeah , but  marketing: Well I think we can only aff , yeah . project manager: the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , user interface: Okay . project manager:  having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people  either for children  user interface: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but  industrial designer: Yeah , maybe , yeah , yeah . industrial designer:  yeah , project manager: Do we agree , do we ? industrial designer: I think maybe seventy percent is a unique   remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like yeah . marketing: Okay but we have to l project manager: Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not <doc-sep>industrial designer: So yeah , I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . industrial designer: So  project manager: Yeah , I was thinking that as well , I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're , user interface: Yeah the universal ones . project manager:  'cause  , what  twenty five Euros , that's about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ? And that's quite a lot for a remote control . As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , project manager: -huh .  , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so  I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , project manager: Okay . marketing: being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? project manager: Okay . marketing: What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like user interface: Okay . marketing: and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li  like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . marketing: They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: what do we think a project manager: So , we're looking for 'Kay . industrial designer: What do we think a good size would be for this ? project manager: We're marketing: industrial designer: 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky project manager: Sorry , carry on . user interface: industrial designer: and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , project manager: user interface: Kind of  , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , like , project manager: For for  user interface: 'cause project manager: remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . No , I wasn't , no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ project manager: Okay well right we'll have to  I'll user interface: but project manager: we're k having another meeting in half an hour so  user interface: Okay . project manager: we should all look into a bit  , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . project manager: if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into  basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . project manager: Which will probably just usurp what I said so user interface: So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? project manager: Shapes and colours and  basically how to make it attractive . marketing: project manager: So industrial designer: project manager: we have  industrial designer: Wait for emails ? marketing:  "

        "Query": "What is the current status of the digits data and what additional assignments were proposed?",
        "Summary": "The test set of digits data, which is almost finished and spans two hours, is nearing completion. Currently, digit extraction has been carried out on approximately half of this data. Moving forward, there are plans to explore the reading of digits in various prosodic groupings as part of future work.",
        "Article": "grad d: and  pick out the ones that have problems , and either correct them or have them re - read . So we probably have like four or five more forms to be read , to be once through the set . I extracted out about an hour 's worth which are the f digits with for which whose speaker have speaker forms , have filled out speaker forms . So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms and for meetings in which the \" key \" file and the transcript files are parsable . Some of the early key files , it looks like , were done by hand , and so they 're not automatically parsable and I have to go back and fix those .  , Liz professor f: So you think two you think two hours is the is the total that we have ? grad d: Yep , yeah . professor f: And you think we th  , I I didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right , but you think we 'll be able to retrieve the other hour , reasonably ? grad d: Yes , absolutely . grad d: So it 's just a question of a little hand - editing of some files and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms . I have this web - based speaker form , and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form , and they 're slowly s trickling in . professor f: So the relevance of the speaker form here , s grad d: It 's for labeling the extracted audio files . grad d: No , I spoke with Jane about that and we sort of decided that it 's probably not an issue that We edit out any of the errors anyway . So the other topic with digits is  , Liz would like to elicit different prosodics , and so we tried last week with them written out in English . So in conversations with Liz and  Jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings . When I look at this , that first line is \" sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . \"  , and so the question is does anyone care ?  , I 've already spoken with Liz and she feels that , correct me if I 'm wrong , that for her , connected numbers is fine , postdoc e: I think two hours is probably fine for a test set , but it may be a little short if we actually wanna do training and adaptation and all that other stuff . professor f: Yeah  , do  you want different prosodics , so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that ? Is that correct ? phd g: Well , we actually figured out a way to grad d: Yeah , the the phd g: the the groupings are randomly generated . professor f: No but , I was asking if that was something you really cared about because if it wasn't , it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people wouldn't , go and do numbers so much . You know if it if it 's phd a:  phd g: I think they may still do it , professor f: Maybe some , but I probably not so much . phd b: What about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group ? phd g: And professor f: Right ? So if you if if you have  grad d: Six dash one , you mean ? professor f: if you go six six six  dash  two nine three one . phd g: I well OK I it might help , I would like to g get away from having only one specific grouping . phd g: but  it seems to me that , at least for us , we can learn to read them as digits postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: and it seems like that might be better for you guys since then you 'll have just more digit data , grad d: Right . phd g: It 's a little bit better for me too because the digits are easier to recognize . Right , read them as single digits , so sixty - one w is read as six one , postdoc e:   phd g: and if people make a mistake we grad d: How about \" O \" versus \" zero \" ? professor f: the other thing is we could just bag it because it 's it 's it 's - I 'm not worrying about it  , because we do have digits training data that we have from  from OGI . I 'm sorry , digits numbers training that we have from OGI , we 've done lots and lots of studies with that . phd g: But it 's nice to get it in this room with the acous professor f: Yeah . phd g:  for it 's professor f: No , no , I guess what I 'm saying is that grad d: Just let them read it how they read it . professor f: to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have . Well that 's fine with me as long as It 's just that I didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits . phd g: So professor f:  we s we we 've We can do this for awhile phd g: OK . Do yo  , do you want do you want this Do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ? phd g: OK . professor f: How much of this do you need ? with  the phd g: It 's actually unclear right now . I just thought well we 're if we 're collec collecting digits , and Adam had said we were running out of the TI forms , I thought it 'd be nice to have them in groups , and probably , all else being equal , it 'd be better for me to just have single digits professor f: OK . phd g: since it 's , you know , a recognizer 's gonna do better on those anyway , and it 's more predictable . So we can know from the transcript what the person said and the transcriber , in general . professor f: OK , well if you pre phd g: But if they make mistakes , it 's no big deal if the people say a hundred instead of \" one OO \" . and also w maybe we can just let them choose \" zero \" versus \" O \" as they as they like because even the same person c sometimes says \" O \" and sometimes says \" zero \" in different context , professor f: Yeah . So I don't have a Specific need cuz if I did I 'd probably try to collect it , you know , without bothering this group , but If we can try it grad d: OK so so I can just add to the instructions to read it as digits not as connected numbers . phd g: Right , and you can give an example like , you know , \" six sixty - one would be read as six one \" . And is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ? professor f: OK . phd g: and grad d: Or is that alright ? phd g:  what do other people think cuz you guys are reading them . postdoc e: I it it to me it looks like you 've got the func the idea of grouping and you have the grou the idea of separation phd g: OK . postdoc e: and , you know , it 's just a matter of u i the instructions , that 's all . grad d: And I think there are about ten different gouping patterns professor f: Let 's try it . phd g: Righ - right , and you just they 're randomly generated and randomly assigned to digits . professor f: Sorry , I I was just gonna say , so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of of recordings now . And you 're saying two hours , is digits , so that 's roughly the ratio then , grad d: Yep . professor f: yeah like you say , I think a couple hours for a for a for a test test set 's OK . It 'd be nice to get , you know , more later because we 'll we might use use this up , in some sense , postdoc e:   professor f: but but  postdoc e: Yeah , I also would like to argue for that cuz it it seems to me that , there 's a real strength in having the same test replicated in a whole bunch of times and adding to that basic test bank . postdoc e:  ? Cuz then you have , you know , more and more , u chances to get away from random errors . And I think , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups , and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having  f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done , which were done by non - native speakers so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set , which is totally American speakers , and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database . I think that  trying to duplicate , spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing TI - digits probably isn't too worthwhile because the recording situation is so different . postdoc e: Except that if you have the stimuli comparable , then it says something about the the contribution of setting professor f: No it 's it 's not the same . postdoc e: and professor f: A little bit , but the other differences are so major . professor f: They 're such major sources of variance that it 's it 's it 's  postdoc e: What 's an example of a of m some of the other differences ? Any other a difference ? professor f: Well i i individual human glottis is going to be different for each one , postdoc e: OK .  , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list , and I 'm sure that they 're doing more specific stuff . grad d: Was it read ? professor f: Yeah , I think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be OGI . professor f: Yeah , no TI - digits was read in th in read in the studio I believe . grad d: But but regardless it 's gonna it 's hard to compare cross - corpus . professor f: And they 're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth , so it 's it 's it 's really pretty different . But I think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework , so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons , it wouldn't be s valid scientifically at least it 'd give you some kind of  frame of reference .  , you know it 's not phd b: Hey Liz , What what do the groupings represent ? postdoc e: OK . phd b: You said there 's like ten different groupings ? phd g: Right , just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line , and number of digits in a group , and the pattern of groupings . Are the patterns like are they based on anything or phd g: I I just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there , and they 're usually grouped into either two , three , or four , four digits at a time . In the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth . So , there 's between ,  Well if you look at it , there are between like three and five groups , and each one has between two and four groupings and I purposely didn't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern . phd g: So grad d: And which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly . grad d: So unlike the previous one , which I d simply replicated TI - digits , this is generated randomly . phd g: But I think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits , whether it 's these digits or TI - digits , to speakers , and compare that to their spontaneous speech , and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data because you might be wearing a different microphone grad d:   phd g: and ,  so it 's it 's nice to have the digits you know , replicated many times . phd g: so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation , and we 're not using the digit data now , but you know grad d: Oh , you 're not . v W we 're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on and I 'd As soon as someone started to read transcript number , that 's read speech and I thought \" well , we 're gonna do better on that , grad d: Oh I see . So those speakers who are very quiet , shy grad d: That would be interesting to see whether that helps . phd g: r Right phd b: Like Adam ? grad d: Do you think that would help adapting on Yeah . phd g: Well , it sh  it 's the same micropho see the nice thing is we have that in the in the same meeting , grad d: Right . phd g: and so you don't get grad d: same microphone , phd a: Yeah . professor f: Yeah  , for the for the  acoustic research , for the signal - processing , farfield stuff , I see it as as as the place that we start . But , th  , it 'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data , but but  the truth is I 'm hoping that we we through the the stuff that that you guys have been doing as you continue that , we get , the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff  ,  nearfield , and then  , we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield , and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield . phd g: The only thing that we don't have , I know this sounds weird , and maybe it 's completely stupid , but we don't have any overlapping digits . phd g: An - yea I know it 's weird , but  phd a: Overlapping digits ! grad d: The the problem I see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load . grad d: No it 's it 's not stupid , it 's just  , try to do it . phd g: I 'm just talkin for the stuff that like Dan Ellis is gonna try , grad d: here , let 's try it . phd g: OK So but grad d: So so you read the last line , I 'll read the first line . professor f: No , I 'll p phd g: So you plu you plug your ears . grad d: Oh I guess if you plug you 're ears you could do it , but then you don't get the the same effects . phd g: Well , what  is actually no not the overlaps that are well - governed linguistically , but the actual fact that there is speech coming from two people grad d: Yeah . phd g: and the beam - forming stuf all the acoustic stuff that like Dan Ellis and and company want to do . phd g: It would take one around amount of ti phd b: It 's the P - make of digit reading . I I mea I 'm I was sort of serious , but I really , I 'm I don't feel strongly enough that it 's a good idea , professor f: See , y grad d: You do the last line , I 'll do the first line . I 'm mean I think it 's doable , grad d: The poor transcribers phd g: I 'm just grad d: they 're gonna hate us . phd g: So , we we could have a round like where you do two at a time , and then the next person picks up when the first guy 's done , or something . professor f: Oh like a round , yeah , like in a a phd g: Like a , phd a: Yeah , just pairwise , professor f: yeah . phd g: I 'm actually sort of serious if it would help people do that kind o but the people who wanna work on it we should talk to them . professor f: I don't think we 're gonna collect vast amounts of data that way , phd g: So . professor f: but I think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody like Dan to play around with , phd g: OK . grad d: I think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session , professor f: yeah . grad d: something like that rather than doing it during a real meeting and you know , do two people at a time then three people at a time and things like that . postdoc e: c c Can I can I have an another another question w about this ? grad d: Oh well . postdoc e: So , there are these digits , which are detached digits , but there are other words that contain the same general phon phoneme sequences . Like \" wonderful \" has \" one \" in it and and Victor Borge had a had a piece on this where he inflated the digits . Well , I wonder if there 's , an if there would be a value in having digits that are in essence embedded in real words to compare in terms of like the articulation of \" one \" in \" wonderful \" versus \" one \" as a digit being read . grad d: Oh ! grad c: It only sounds w good when you scream it , though . postdoc e: Well , I just wanted to offer that as a possible task professor f: Yes . postdoc e: because , you know , if we were to each read his embedded numbers words in sent in sentences cuz it 's like an entire sketch he does and I wouldn't take the inflated version . So he talks about the woman being \" two - derful \" , and and a But , you know , if it were to be deflated , just the normal word , it would be like a little story that we could read . postdoc e: I don't know if it would be useful for comparison , but it 's embedded numbers . grad d: I think for something like that we 'd be better off doing like  TIMIT . Well I think the question is what the research is , so  , I presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here . professor f: So if somebody wanted to do that , if they wanted to look at the the the difference of the  phones in the digits in the context of a word versus  the digits a a non - digit word versus in digit word ,  that would be a good thing to do , but I think someone would have to express interest in that . professor f: I think , to  if you were interested in it then we could do it , for instance . grad d: We have ASR results from Liz , transcript status from Jane , and disk space and storage formats from Don . Does do we have any prefer preference on which way we wanna we wanna go ? phd g: Well I was actually gonna skip the ASR results part , in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about grad d:   phd g: since I think that 's more important to moving forward , but  Morgan has this paper copy and if people have questions , it 's pretty preliminary in terms of ASR results because we didn't do anything fancy , but I think e just having the results there , and pointing out some main conclusions like it 's not the speaking style that differs , it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors . And then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors , which you would expect but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth , leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some kind of  , echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close - talking mikes . phd a: So these grad d: why don't you , if you have a hard copy , why don't you email it to the list . professor f: Yeah , so it 's the same thing ? phd g:  he he professor f: It 's the same thing I mailed to every everybody that w where it was , phd g: it it 's that paper . phd g: and it 's Let 's see , th I guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad . grad d: Horrible ? phd g: And it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech . phd a: So , your your ASR results were run on the channels synchronized , phd g: Yes , cuz that 's all that w had been transcribed at the time , phd a: OK . phd g: the closer t that would be very interesting for us phd b: So if phd g: because we professor f: Yeah , that 's that 's why I only used the part from use phd a: Yeah . phd b: So if there was a segment of speech this long phd g: cuz phd a: Yeah . phd b: and oh and someone said \" oh , \" the whole thing was passed to the recognizer ? grad d: And someone said \" oh \" in the front in the middle . In fact I I pulled out a couple classic examples in case you wanna u use them in your talk of phd b: That 's why there 's so many insertion errors ? grad c:   phd g: Chuck on the lapel , so Chuck wore the lapel three out of four times . phd g: yeah , and I wore the lapel once , and for me the lapel was OK . phd g: Right , but when Chuck wore the lapel and Morgan was talking there 're a couple really long utterances where Chuck is saying a few things inside , and it 's picking up all of Morgan 's words pretty well and so the rec you know , there 're error rates because of insertion Insertions aren't bounded , so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate . So I this is sort of what we expected , but it 's nice to be able to to show it . phd g: And also I just wanted to mention briefly that ,  Andreas and I called up Dan Ellis who 's still stuck in Switzerland , and we were gonna ask him if if there 're you know , what 's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that . \" phd g: And he We 've given him the data we have so far , so these sychronous cases where there are overlap . phd g: And he 's gonna look into trying to run some things that are out there and see how well it can do phd b: So phd g: because right now we 're not able to actually report on recognition in a real paper , like a Eurospeech paper , because it would look sort of premature . phd b: So So the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody 's only speaking a small amount in it , and then try to figure out where they 're speaking based on the other peopl phd g: Right . Or who 's At any point in time who 's the foreground speaker , who 's the background speaker . phd g: So there 's like grad d: But how would you do that automatically ? phd g: Well ther there 's phd a: I 've actually done some experiments with cross - correlation phd b: Right . phd a: and it seems to work pretty well to to get rid of those those overlaps , grad d:  that that 's the sort of thing that you would do . Exactly , so it 's it 's a phd b: So why do you want to do echo cancellation ? phd g: it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation which I don't know enough about to talk about . phd g: But , right , and that would be similar to what you 're also trying to do , but using  , you know , more than energy phd a: Yeah . phd b: So it would be phd g: So the idea is to basically run this on the whole meeting . and get the locations , which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual speak phd b: OK . professor f: Yeah , Dave Dave  is , also gonna be doin usin playing around with echo cancellation for the nearfield farfield stuff , phd g: So . professor f: so we 'll be phd g: And I guess Espen ? This is  is he here too ? professor f: Yeah . phd g: May also be working So it would just be ver that 's really the next step because we can't do too much , you know , on term in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem phd b:   phd b: I think this also ties into one of the things that Jane is gonna talk about too . grad d: I also wanted to say I have done all this chopping up of digits , postdoc e:   Definitely grad d: And and I have scripts that will extract it out from \" key \" files phd g: and Don should grad d: and and do all the naming automatically , phd g: OK . grad c: You 've compiled the list of , speaker names ? phd g: So that that 's it for the grad d:   grad d: and it does all sorts of matches because the way people filled out names is different on every single file so it does a very fuzzy sort of match . phd g: So at this point we can sort of finalize the naming , and so forth , grad c:   phd g: and we 're gonna basically re rewrite out these waveforms that we did because as you notice in the paper your \" M O in one meeting and \" M O - two \" in another meeting and it 's we just need to standardize the grad c: Yeah . phd g: no it 's it 's professor f: No , I didn't notice that actually . So th I now have a script that you can just say basically look up Morgan , phd g: So professor f: Yeah . Is that something we need to talk about at the meeting , or should you just talk with Chuck at some other time ? grad c: I had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms and I don't know exactly who to ask .  , yeah , which is grad d: And I assume half of it is scratch and half of it is ? grad c: I 'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it . grad c: yeah , I don't know what 's typical here , but  , it 's local though , so grad d: That doesn't matter . How do you do that ? professor f: In fact , this is an eighteen gig drive , or is it a thirty six gig drive with eighteen grad d: N grad c: Eighteen . It was a spare that Dave had around grad d: Slash N slash machine name , slash X A in all likelihood . grad d: so the the only question is how much of it The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not . grad d: So what you wanna do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate . grad d: So , the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal because disks don't crash very frequently , grad c: Right .  all of this stuff can be regenerated , phd g: Yeah it 's grad c: it 's just a question grad d: Then put it all on scratch phd g: Well the grad d: because we 're ICSI is is bottlenecked by backup . grad d: So we wanna put phd g: Well I 'd leave all the All the transcript stuff shouldn't should be backed up , postdoc e:   phd g: but all the waveform Sound files should not be backed up , grad c: Yeah , I guess Right . So , I guess th the other question was then , should we shorten them , downsample them , or keep them in their original form ?  grad d: It just depends on your tools .  , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , I would leave them expanded , grad c: Right . grad d: so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything . phd g: We can downsample them , grad c: Do you think that 'd be OK ? phd g: so . phd g:  the r the front - end on the SRI recognizer just downsamples them on the fly , grad c: Yeah , I guess the only argument against downsampling is to preserve just the original files in case we want to experiment with different filtering techniques . phd g: so So that 's professor f: I I I 'm sorry phd g: Yeah , if professor f: Yeah , l  over all our data , we we want to not downsample . phd g: So we 're what we 're doing is we 're writing out  , this is just a question . We 're writing out these individual segments , that wherever there 's a time boundary from Thilo , or or Jane 's transcribers , you know , we we chop it there . phd g: And the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer , professor f:   grad d: Yeah , as I said , since that 's it 's regeneratable , what I would do is take downsample it , phd g: So Yeah . grad d: and compress it however you 're e the SRI recognizer wants to take it in . professor f: ye phd g: So we can't shorten them , grad c: Right . professor f: As yeah , as long as there is a a form that we can come from again , that is not downsampled , then , grad c: r Yeah . That that 's why we need more disk space professor f: uuu phd g: cuz we 're basically duplicating the originals ,  professor f: Yeah . But for for fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on phd g: Oh yeah . professor f: we would like to phd b: So the SRI front - end won't take a  an an a large audio file name and then a a list of segments to chop out from that large audio file ? professor f: Yeah . phd b: They actually have to be chopped out already ? phd g: it 's better if they 're chopped out , phd b:  - huh . phd g: and and it it will be yeah , y we could probably write something to do that , but it 's actually convenient to have them chopped out cuz you can run them , you know , in different orders . grad d: And that 's the whole point about the naming conventions phd g: you can get rid of grad d: is that you could run all the English speaking , phd g: Yeah , it it 's a lot faster . grad d: all the native speakers , and all the non - native speakers , phd g: Right . You can grab everything with the word \" the \" in it , grad d: and all the men , and all the women . phd g: and it 's That 's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time , find the time boundaries and So in principle , yeah , you could do that , phd b: I don't I don't think that 's really right . phd g: but it 's but it 's  grad d: \" That 's just not right , man . \" The the point phd g: These are long These are long grad d: So so s For example , what if you wanted to run run all the native speakers . grad d: Right , so if if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere , extracts out the language , finds the time - marks for that particular one , do it that way . The way they 're doing it , you have that already extracted and it 's embedded in the file name . And so , you know , you just say phd g: We - yeah that 's so that 's part of it grad d: y so you just say you know \" asterisk E asterisk dot wave \" , and you get what you want . And the other part is just that once they 're written out it it is a lot faster to to process them . Otherwise , you 're just accessing grad d: This is all just temporary access , so I don't I think it 's all just It 's fine . Two gig ? phd g: So we 're also looking at these in Waves like for the alignments and so forth . phd g: You need to s have these small files , and in fact , even for the Transcriber program  grad d: Yes you can . phd g: Yeah , if you try to load s really long waveform into X Waves , you 'll be waiting there for phd b: No , I I 'm not suggesting you load a long wave file , phd g: Oh phd b: I 'm just saying you give it a start and an end time . grad d: I th w The transcribers didn't have any problem with that did they Jane ? postdoc e: What 's th u w in what respect ? phd g: Loading the long phd a: No , with the Transcriber tool , it 's no problem . phd g: It takes a very long ti phd a: Yeah just to load a transcription postdoc e: In the in   grad d: Are you talking about Transcriber or X Waves ? phd g: Huh . phd g: Actually , you 're talking about Transcriber , right ? phd a: Yeah . grad d: And they were loading the full mixed files then , postdoc e: Yeah . Well we we have a problem with that , you know , time - wise on a It - it 's a lot slower to load in a long file , grad d:  . phd g: and also to check the file , so if you have a transcript , grad d: Well regardless , it 's professor f: Yeah . phd g:  it 's I I think overall you could get everything to work by accessing the same waveform and trying to find two you know , the begin and end times .  , but I think it 's more efficient , if we have the storage space , to have the small ones . grad d: and , it 's no problem , right ? phd g: Yeah , it 's grad d: Because it 's not backed up . grad d: So we just phd g: It 's it 's just grad d: If we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive and make it all scratch space . phd g: Yeah , so these wouldn't be backed up , the postdoc e: Yeah . grad d: So remind me afterward phd g: And grad d: and I 'll and we 'll look at your disk and see where to put stuff .  , I could just u do a DU on it right ? And just see which how much is on each So . Alright so , first of all , there was a an interest in the transcribe transcription , checking procedures and and I can tell you first , to go through the steps although you 've probably seen them .  , as you might imagine , when you 're dealing with , r really c a fair number of words , and  , @ @ natural speech which means s self - repairs and all these other factors , that there 're lots of things to be , s standardized and streamlined and checked on . And , so , I did a bunch of checks , and the first thing I did was obviously a spell - check . And at that point I discovered certain things like , \" accommodate \" with one \" M \" , that kind of thing . And then , in addition to that , I did an exhaustive listing of the forms in the data file , which included n detecting things like f faulty punctuation and things phd b: I 'm I 'm sorry to interrupt postdoc e: Yeah ? phd b: you could could I just back up a little bit postdoc e: Sure , please , phd b: and postdoc e: yeah , please , please . phd b: So you 're doing these So the whole process is that the transcribers get the conversation postdoc e: Yeah , yeah , yeah . phd b: And then when they 're finished with it , it comes to you , postdoc e: That 's right . And so , I do a an exhaustive listing of the forms Actually , I will go through this in in order , so if if we could maybe wait and stick keep that for a second cuz we 're not ready for that . grad d: So on the fifth page , seven down postdoc e: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Exactly ! Exactly ! Alright so , a spelling check first then an exhaustive listing of the ,  all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached and at that point I pick up things like , oh , you know , word followed by two commas . But there 's w And that that 's done with the assumption that pronunciation variants can be handled . So for things like \" and \" , the fact that someone doesn't say the \" D \" ,  that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription because a a good pronunciation , you know , model would be able to handle that . However , things like \" cuz \" where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable , and furthermore , it 's a form that 's specific to spoken language , those are r reasons f for those reasons I I kept that separate , and used the convention of using \" CUZ \" for that form , however , glossing it so that it 's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one , and a couple of others , not many . So \" wanna \" is another one , \" going \"  , \" gonna \" is another one , with just the assumption , again , that this th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider expect that a pronunciation model , to handle . And Chuck , you in you indicated that \" cuz \" is is one of those that 's handled in a different way also , didn't you ? Did I phd b: I don't remember . postdoc e: but someone told me that in fact \" cuz \" is treated differently in , i u in this context because of that r reason that , it 's a little bit farther than a pronunciation variant . OK , so after that , let 's see , phd b: So that was part of the spell - check , or was that that was after the spell - check ? postdoc e:  . Well so when I get the exhau So the spell - check picks up those words because they 're not in the dictionary . postdoc e: So it gets \" cuz \" and \" wanna \" and that grad d: And then you gloss them ? postdoc e: Yeah ,   Run it through I have a sed You know , so I do sed script saying whenever you see \" gonna \" you know , \" convert it to gonna \" , you know , \" gloss equals quote going - to quote \" , you know . OK , I also wrote a script which will , retrieve anything in curly brackets , or anything which I 've classified as an acronym , and a pronounced acronym . So if it 's \" ACL \" then it 's \" A \" underscore \" C \" underscore \" L \" . grad d: And so so your list here , are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings ? postdoc e: And the th Yes . phd g: can I ask a question about the glossing ,  before we go on ? postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: So , for a word like \" because \" is it that it 's always predictably \" because \" ?  , is \" CUZ \" always meaning \" because \" ? postdoc e: Yes , but not the reverse . So sometimes people will say \" because \" in the meeting , and if if they actually said \" because \" , then it 's written as \" because \" with no w \" cuz \" doesn't even figure into the equation . professor f: But but in our meetings people don't say \" hey cuz how you doing ? \" phd g: Beca - because Right . phd g: so , I guess So , from the point of view of postdoc e: That 's a good point . phd g: The the only problem is that with for the recognition we we map it to \" because \" , grad d: Well , phd g: and so if we know that \" CUZ \" postdoc e: That 's fine . phd g: but , we don't grad d: You have the gloss form so you always replace it . postdoc e: and he 's bee he has a glo he has a script that grad c: I replace the \" cuz \" with \" because \" if it 's glossed . grad c: And phd g: But then there are other glosses that we don't replace , right ? Because postdoc e: Yes . postdoc e: on the different on the different types of comments , which we 'll which we 'll see in just a second . postdoc e: So the pronounceable acronyms get underscores , the things in curly brackets are viewed as comments . w And maybe we 'll expand that grad d:  postdoc e: but the but the comments are , of four types mainly right now . grad d: Can ca postdoc e: Another type is ,  grad d: So a are we done with acronyms ? Cuz I had a question on what what this meant . postdoc e: OK so , gloss is things like replacing the full form u with the , more abbreviated one to the left .  , then you have if it 's  , there 're a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words , and wo some of them are laughs and breathes , so we have  that 's prepended with a v a tag of \" VOC \" . phd a: Whew !  postdoc e: And the non - vocal ones are like door - slams and tappings , and that 's prepended with a no non - vocalization . phd b: So then it just an ending curly brace there , or is there something else in there . postdoc e: Oh yeah , so i e this would grad d: A comment , basically . postdoc e: And then the no non - vocalization would be something like a door - slam . And then the third type right now , is m things that fall in the category of comments about what 's happening . So it could be something like , you know , \" referring to so - and - so \" , \" talking about such - and - such \" , you know , \" looking at so - and - so \" . phd b: on the middle t So , in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left . But in the middle two Th - it 's not applying to anything , right ? postdoc e: Yeah , and this gets substituted here . grad d: Well the \" QUAL \" can be The \" QUAL \" is applying to the left . postdoc e: Well , and actually , it is true that , with respect to \" laugh \" , there 's another one which is \" while laughing \" , grad d: \" While laughing \" . postdoc e: and that is , i i An argument could be made for this tur turning that into a qualitative statement because it 's talking about the thing that preceded it , but at present we haven't been , coding the exact scope of laughing , you know , and so to have \" while laughing \" , you know that it happened somewhere in there which could well mean that it occurred separately and following , or , you know , including some of the utterances to the left . Haven't been awfully precise about that , but I have here , now we 're about to get to the to this now , I have frequencies . But , the very front page deals with this , final c pa  , aspect of the standardization which has to do with the spoken forms like \"  -  \" and \"  -  \" and \" ha \" and \"  -  \" and all these different types . And , someone pointed out to me , this might have been Chuck , about ,  about how a recognizer , if it 's looking for \"  - hmmm \" with three M 's , and it 's transcribed with two M 's , that it might  , that it might increase the error rate which is which would really be a shame because  , I p I personally w would not be able to make a claim that those are dr dramatically different items . postdoc e: I I should say grad d: So it 's a small list . So , I 'm gonna I 'm gonna I 'm gonna check grad d: That that 's known as \" found data \" . I got It was stored in a place I didn't expect , grad c: It 's like the z Zapruder Film . So I 'll I 'll be able to get through that tonight , and then everyth i well , actually later today probably . postdoc e: And I made it so that these are , with a couple exceptions but , things that you wouldn't find in the spell - checker so that they 'll show up really easily . And ,  grad c: Jane , can I ask you a question ? What 's that very last one correspond to ? postdoc e: Sure . grad c: is that like someone 's like burning or some such thing ? postdoc e: So - c I haven't listened to it so I don't know . grad c: Like their hair 's on fire ? postdoc e: I haven't heard it actually . grad d: Ah ! phd a: It 's the Castle of Ah ! phd g: Actually we we gave this to our pronunciation person , grad c: it looks like that . postdoc e: Did she hear the th did she actually hear it ? Cuz I haven't heard it . phd g: No , we just gave her a list of words that , you know , weren't in our dictionary and so of course it picked up stuff like this , and she just didn't listen so she didn't know . Yeah I 'm curious to se hear what it is , but I didn't know wanna change it to something else until I knew . phd g: Maybe it 's \" argh \" ? postdoc e: Well , sss , you know phd g:  grad c: But that 's not really like postdoc e: Hhh . grad c: No one really says \" argh , \" you know , postdoc e:  phd g: Yeah . Right , no one say grad c: it 's not professor f: Well , you just did . phd b: Except for now ! grad c: Well , there 's another there 's another word error . grad d: Ah ! postdoc e: phd g: So , Jane , what 's the d grad d: Maybe he died while dictating . phd g: I have one question about the the \" EH \" versus like the \" AH \" and the \"  \" . postdoc e: That 's partly a nonnative - native thing , phd g: OK . phd g:  postdoc e: But it 's mostly non - native phd a: H phd b: That 's \" eh \" versus \" ah \" ? phd g: S OK . grad d: Eh ? phd g: \" Eh , \" yeah right , cuz there were were some speakers that did definite \" eh 's \" postdoc e:   phd g: but right now we phd b: They were the Canadians , right ? professor f: Canadians , yeah , yeah , yeah . phd g: So , it it 's actually probably good for us to know the difference between the real \" eh \" and the one that 's just like \"  \" or transcribed \" aaa \" postdoc e: Exactly . phd g: cuz in like in Switchboard , you would see e all of these forms , but they all were like \"  \" . grad d: You mean just the single letter \" a \" as in the particle ? phd a: The transcription or grad d: Article . phd g: No , no ,  like the the \"  \" , postdoc e: \"  \" . grad d: I 'm just these poor transcribers , they 're gonna hate this meeting . phd g: But you 're a native German speaker so it 's not a not a issue for phd a: Yeah . phd g: So it 's like Japanese and Spanish postdoc e: Yeah I I think you 've  - huh , yeah . phd g: and grad d: I didn't get that , postdoc e: That makes sense . postdoc e: Yeah , and so , you know , th th I have there are some , Americans who who are using this \" eh \" too , and I haven't listened to it systematically , maybe with some of them , they 'd end up being \"  's \" but , I my spot - checking has made me think that we do have \" eh \" in also , American e e data represented here . But any case , that 's the this is reduced down from really quite a long a much longer list , phd g: Yeah this is great . grad d: Yeah , it 's good , postdoc e: and this is grad d: yeah . postdoc e: functionally pretty , you know , also It was fascinating , I was listening to some of these , I guess two nights ago , and it 's just hilarious to liste to to do a search for the \"  -  's \" . postdoc e: Just I wanted to say I w think it would be fun to make a montage of it because there 's a \"   postdoc e: All these different vocal tracts , you know , but it 's it 's the same item .  , then the acronyms y and the ones in parentheses are ones which the transcriber wasn't sure of , grad d: Oh I see . postdoc e: and I haven't been able to listen to to to clarify , but you can see that the parenthesis convention makes it very easy to find them grad d: o How about question mark ? postdoc e: cuz it 's the only place where where they 're used . grad d: So they so it 's \" PLP ? \" postdoc e: Exactly . Sometimes the contrastive stress is showing up , and ,  professor f: I 'm sorry , I I got lost here . What - w what 's the difference between the parenthesized acronym and the non - parenthesized ? postdoc e: The parenthesized is something that the transcriber thought was ANN , but wasn't entirely sure . So I 'd need to go back or someone needs to go back , and say , you know , yes or no , professor f: Ah . postdoc e: But the parentheses are used only in that context in the transcripts , of of noti noticing that there 's something uncertain . grad d: Yeah , P - make is phd g: Yeah  cuz they they have no idea , grad d: That 's a good one . phd g: but it 's professor f: I I don't recognize a lot of these . grad d: I know ! I I was saying that I think a lot of them are the Networks meeting . phd g: and the PTA was in these , topics about children , postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: Is the P - PTA working ? postdoc e: Right and sometimes , you see a couple of these that are actually \" OK 's \" so it 's it 's may be that they got to the point where  it was low enough understandable understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said \" OK . \" You know , so it isn't really necessarily a an undecipherable acronym , grad c: There 's a lot of \" OK 's \" . This professor f: The number to the left is the number of incidences ? grad d: Count . professor f: So CTS is really big here , grad d: Yeah , I wonder what it is . phd a: So what is the difference between \" papers rustling \" and \" rustling papers \" ? professor f: IP , I know what IP is . postdoc e: But , I I 'm a little hesitant to to collapse across categories unless I actually listen to them . OK well professor f: Wh - the self - referential aspect of these these p phd g: I 'm wai grad c: Yeah . phd g: Well this is exactly how people will prove that these meetings do differ because we 're recording , right ? grad d: Yes . phd g: Y no normally you don't go around saying , \" Now you 've said it six times . phd g: Now you 've said \" postdoc e: But did you notice that there were seven hundred and eighty five instances of \" OK \" ? phd a: Seven hundred eighty - five instances . grad d: And that 's an underestimate postdoc e: Extra forty one if it 's questioned . grad c: Is this after like did you do some  replacements for all the different form of \" OK \" to this ? professor f: Yeah . phd b: Wait a minute , w s professor f: So now we 're up to seven hundred and eighty eight . postdoc e: Yeah that 's grad c: Although , what 's there 's one with a slash after it . phd b: Was that somewhere where they were gonna say \" new speaker \" or something ? postdoc e: No , I looked for that , but that doesn't actually exist . postdoc e: I i it 's the only grad c: There 's postdoc e: it 's the only pattern that has a slash after it , and I think it 's it 's an epiphenomenon . grad d: So I 'll just I was just looking at the bottom of page three there , is that \" to be \" or \" not to be \" . phd b: There 's no tilde in front of it , postdoc e: Oh that 's cute . \" postdoc e: There is th one Y well , no , that 's r that 's legitimate . So now , comments , you can see they 're listed again , same deal , with exhaustive listing of everything found in everything except for these final th thirty minutes . grad d: OK so , on some of these QUALs , postdoc e: Yeah . grad d: are they really QUALs , or are they glosses ? So like there 's a \" QUAL TCL \" . professor f: What 's a QUAL ? grad d: Oh I see , I see . grad c: Sh - shouldn't it be \" QUAL TICKLE \" or something ? grad d: It wasn't said \" TCL \" . grad c: Like it 's not postdoc e: On the in the actual script in the actual transcript , I s I So this this happens in the very first one . postdoc e: Because we they didn't say \" TCL \" , they said \" tickle \" . professor f: I f I forget , what 's QUAL ? postdoc e: Qual - qualifier . grad c: It 's not something you wanna replace with postdoc e: Comment or contextual comment . phd b: So they didn't mean \" tickle \" as in Elmo , grad c: but phd a: Tickle ? professor f: Yeah . phd g: But at some point  , we probably shoul grad d: We 'll probably add it to the language model . phd b: Add what , Liz ? grad d: We can go on lan lan add it to both dictionary and language model . phd g: it 's in the language model , w yeah , but it so it 's the pronunciation model that has to have a pronunciation of \" tickle \" . Right ? phd a: \" tickle \" is pronounced \" tickle \" ? phd b: What are you saying ? grad d: It 's pronounced the same it 's pronounced the same as the verb . phd g: I 'm sorry ! grad d: So I think it 's the language model that makes it different . What I meant is that there should be a pronunciation \" tickle \" for TCL as a word . phd g: And that word in the in , you know , it stays in the language model wherever it was . phd g: Yeah you never would put \" tickle \" in the language model in that form , postdoc e:  grad d: Right . There 's actually a bunch of cases like this with people 's names and phd b: So how w there 'd be a problem for doing the language modeling then with our transcripts the way they are . Yeah so th th there there 's a few cases like that where the  , the word needs to be spelled out in in a consistent way as it would appear in the language , but there 's not very many of these . grad d: And and you 'll ha you 'll have to do it sychronously . grad d: Right , so y so , whoever 's creating the new models , will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously . We have this there is this thing I was gonna talk to you about at some point about , you know , what do we do with the dictionary as we 're up updating the dictionary , these changes have to be consistent with what 's in the Like spelling people 's names and so forth . If we make a spelling correction to their name , like someone had Deborah Tannen 's name mispelled , and since we know who that is , you know , we could correct it , grad d: You can correct it . phd g: but but we need to make sure we have the mispel If it doesn't get corrected we have to have a pronunciation as a mispelled word in the dictionary . postdoc e: Well , of course now the the Tannen corre the spelling c change . So if there 's things that get corrected before we get them , it 's it 's not an issue , postdoc e:   phd g: but if there 's things that  , we change later , then we always have to keep our the dictionary up to date . And then , yeah , in the case of \" tickle \" I guess we would just have a , you know , word \" TCL \" which phd b:   phd g: which normally would be an acronym , you know , \" TCL \" grad d: Right . postdoc e: \" ICSI \" is is one of those that sometimes people pronounce and sometimes they say \" ICSI . postdoc e: So , those that are l are listed in the acronyms , I actually know phd g: Oh yeah . The others , e those really do need to be listened to cuz I haven't been able to go to all the IC ICSI things , phd g: Right , exactly . postdoc e: and and until they 've been listened to they stay as \" ICSI \" . professor f: Don and I were just noticing , love this one over on page three , \" vocal vocal gesture mimicking sound of screwing something into head to hold mike in place . postdoc e: It was ! In fact , it was ! Yeah ! grad d: A lot of these are me the the \" beep is said with a high pit high pitch and lengthening . grad d: That was the I was imitating  , beeping out postdoc e: Yeah , that 's it . phd g: Oh there is something spelled out \" BEEEEEEP \" grad c:  postdoc e: That 's it . Because he was saying , \" How many E 's do I have to allow for ? \" grad c: You need a lot of grad d: What I meant was \" beep \" . postdoc e: And those of course get get picked up in the frequency check grad d: glosses . postdoc e: and you know  it gets kicked out in the spelling , and it also gets kicked out in the , freq frequency listing . postdoc e: I have the there 're various things like \" breathe \" versus \" breath \" versus \" inhale \" and , hhh , you know , I don't know . I I think they don't have any implications for anything else so it 's like I 'm tempted to leave them for now an and It 's easy enough to find them when they 're in curly brackets . professor f: \" Sings finale - type song \" grad c: Yeah , that was in the first meeting . grad d: postdoc e: Yeah , but I don't actually remember what it was . \" postdoc e:  Chuck Chuck led to a refinement here which is to add \" NUMS \" if these are parts of the read numbers . Now you already know i that I had , in places where they hadn't transcribed numbers , I put \" numbers \" in place of any kind of numbers , but there are places where they , it th this convention came later an and at the very first digits task in some transcripts they actually transcribed numbers . And , d Chuck pointed out that this is read speech , and it 's nice to have the option of ignoring it for certain other prob  p  , things . And that 's why there 's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five or three hundred and five times right now which is just well n n \" NUMS \" by itself grad d: \" NUMS \" , yeah .  , i with the sed command you can really just change it however you want because it 's systematically encoded , you know ? grad d: Yep . postdoc e: Have to think about what 's the best for for the overall purposes , but in any case , \" numbers \" and \" NUMS \" are a part of this digits task thing . And actually , th  , the reason I b did it this way was because I initially started out with the other version , you have the numbers and you have the full form and the parentheses , however sometimes people stumble over these numbers they 're saying . And there 's no way of capturing that if you 're putting the numbers off to the side . You can't have the seven and grad d: So what 's to the left of these ? postdoc e: The left is i so example the very first one , grad d:   postdoc e: And then , in here , \" NUMS \" , so it 's not going to be mistaken as a gloss . grad d: OK now , the other example is , in the glosses right there , postdoc e: Thank you . grad d: What what 's to the left of that ? postdoc e: Well now In that case it 's people saying things like \" one one one dash so - and - so \" or they 're saying  \" two  zero \" whatever . postdoc e: And in that case , it 's part of the numbers task , and it 's not gonna be included in the read digits anyway , phd b: So there will be a \" NUMS \" tag on those lines ? postdoc e: so I m in the  There is . postdoc e: So , so gloss in the same line that would have \" gloss quote one one one dash one thirty \" , you 'd have a gloss at the end of the line saying , \" curly bracket NUMS curly bracket \" . postdoc e: So if you if you did a , a \" grep minus V nums \" phd g: Oh , so you could do \" grep minus V nums \" . phd g: So there wouldn't be something like i if somebody said something like , \" Boy , I 'm really tired , OK . Cuz I was doing the \" grep minus V \" quick and dirty and looked like that was working OK , postdoc e:   Now why do we what 's the reason for having like the point five have the \" NUMS \" on it ? Is that just like when they 're talking about their data or something ? postdoc e: This is more because phd g: Or postdoc e: Yeah . Oh these are all these , the \" NUMS point \" , this all where they 're saying \" point \" something or other . phd g: These are all like inside the spontaneous postdoc e: And the other thing too is for readability of the transcript .  if you 're trying to follow this while you 're reading it it 's really hard to read , you know eh , \" so in the data column five has \" , you know , \" one point five compared to seventy nine point six \" , it 's like when you see the words it 's really hard to follow the argument . And this is just really a a way of someone who would handle th the data in a more discourse - y way to be able to follow what 's being said . postdoc e: So this is where Chuck 's , overall h architecture comes in , phd g: I see .  , there will be scripts that are written to convert it into these t these main two uses and th some scripts will take it down th e into a f a for ta take it to a format that 's usable for the recognizer an  , other scripts will take it to a form that 's usable for the for linguistics an and discourse analysis . These will just be things that are generated , grad d: Right postdoc e: and e by using scripts . postdoc e: When things change then the the script will cham change but the but there won't be stored copies of in different versions of things . phd g: So , I guess I 'd have one request here which is just , maybe to make it more robust , th that the tag , whatever you would choose for this type of \" NUMS \" where it 's inside the spontaneous speech , is different than the tag that you use for the read speech . phd g: that way w if we make a mistake parsing , or something , we don't see the \" point five \" , or or it 's not there , then we phd b:   phd g: a Just an And actually for things like \" seven eighths \" , or people do fractions too I guess , you maybe you want one overall tag for sort of that would be similar to that , postdoc e: Except phd g: or As long as they 're sep as they 're different strings that we that 'll make our p sort of processing more robust . postdoc e: Well phd g: Cuz we really will get rid of everything that has the \" NUMS \" string in it . phd b: I suppose what you could do is just make sure that you get rid of everything that has \" curly brace NUMS curly brace \" . postdoc e: You know , as I said I was considering changing it to \" digits \" . And , it just i you know , it 's just a matter of deciding on whatever it is , and being sure the scripts know . phd g: It would probably be safer , if you 're willing , to have a separate tag just because  , then we know for sure .  , phd b: Yeah , and it makes it I guess the thing about phd g: but it it 's probably not hard for a person to tell the difference phd b: Yeah . phd g: because one 's in the context of a you know , a transcribed word string , phd b: Right . postdoc e: The other thing is you can get really so minute with these things phd g: and So postdoc e: and increase the size of the files and the re and decrease the readability to such an extent by simply something like \" percent \" . Now I I could have adopted a similar convention for \" percent \" , but somehow percent is not so hard , you know ? grad d:  . postdoc e: i It 's just when you have these points and you 're trying to figure out where the decimal places are And we could always add it later . And you 'll find both of those in one of these meetings , where he 's saying \" well the first point I wanna make is so - and - so \" and he goes through four points , and also has all these decimals . phd b: what does the SRI recognizer output for things like that ? \" seven point five \" . phd b: Right , the word \" seven \" ? grad d: Well , the numbers ? phd b: The number \" seven \" ? phd g: The word . professor f: So I 'd so \" I 'd like I 'd like to talk about point five \" . phd g: it 's the same point , actually , the the p you know , the word \" to \" and the word y th \" going to \" and \" to go to \" those are two different \" to 's \" and so there 's no distinction there . phd g: It 's just just the word \" point \" has Yeah , every word has only one , yeah e one version even if even if it 's A actually even like the word \" read \" and \" read \" Those are two different words . phd g: So , yeah , I I like the idea of having this in there , I just I was a little bit worried that , the tag for removing the read speech because i What if we have like \" read letters \" or , I don't know , grad d: We might wanna just a separate tag that says it 's read . OK ? Are we done ? postdoc e: Well I wanted to say also regarding the channelized data , grad d: Oh , I guess we 're not done . postdoc e: that , Thilo requested , that we ge get some segments done by hand to e e s reduce the size of the time bins wh like was Chuc - Chuck was mentioning earlier that , that , if you if you said , \" Oh \" and it was in part of a really long , s complex , overlapping segment , that the same start and end times would be held for that one grad d: Well postdoc e: as for the longer utterances , grad d: We did that for one meeting , right , postdoc e: and grad d: so you have that data don't you ? phd a: Yeah , that 's the training data . postdoc e: And he requested that there be , similar , samples done for five minute stretches c involving a variety of speakers and overlapping secti sections . postdoc e: He gave me he did the very nice , he he did some shopping through the data and found segments that would be useful . In addition the I 've I have the transcribers expanding the amount that they 're doing actually . postdoc e: So right now , I know that as of today we got an extra fifteen minutes of that type , and I 'm having them expand the realm on either side of these places where they 've already started . postdoc e: But if if you know , and I and he 's gonna give me some more sections that that he thinks would be useful for this purpose . postdoc e: Because it 's true , if we could do the the more fine grained tuning of this , using an algorithm , that would be so much more efficient . phd a: So I I thought we we sh we sh perhaps we should try to to start with those channelized versions just to just to try it . Give it Give one tr transcriber the the channelized version of of my speech - nonspeech detection and look if if that 's helpful for them , or just let them try if if that 's better or If they if they can postdoc e: You mean to start from scratch f in a brand new transcript ? phd a: Yeah . As it stands we 're still in the phase of sort of , cleaning up the existing data getting things , in i m more tight tightly time  , aligned . I also wanna tell  , I also wanted to r raise the issue that OK so , there 's this idea we 're gonna have this master copy of the transcript , it 's gonna be modified by scripts t into these two different functions . postdoc e: So right now we 've taken this i initial one , it was a single channel basically the way it was input . And now , thanks to the advances made in the interface , we can from now on use the channelized part , and , any changes that are made get made in the channelized version kind of thing . But I wanted to get all the finished all the checks phd b: Yeah , so that has implications for your script . So , have those e e the vis the ten hours that have been transcribed already , have those been channelized ? And I know I 've seen @ @ I 've seen they 've been channelized , postdoc e: Yes , they have . grad d: All ten hours ? grad c: but postdoc e: Except for the missing thirty minutes . grad c: have they  have they been has the time have the time markings been adjusted , p on a per channel grad d: Great . postdoc e: for for a total of like twenty m f for a total of Let 's see , four times total of about an thirty minutes . grad c: I guess , I don't know if we should talk about this now , or not , but I grad d: Well it 's just we 're missing tea . grad c: No , but  my question is like should I wait until all of those are processed , and channelized , like the time markings are adjusted before I do all the processing , and we start like branching off into the into the our layer of  transcripts . postdoc e: Well , you know the problem the problem is that some some of the adjustments that they 're making are to bring are to combine bins that were time bins which were previously separate . postdoc e: And so , i i i it 's true that it 's likely to be adjusted in the way that the words are more complete . postdoc e: so I it 's gonna be a more reliable thing and I 'm not sure grad c:  I 'm sure about that , postdoc e: Yeah . grad c: but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done , or when you expect them to finish it , or postdoc e: Well partly it depends on how  , how e effective it will be to apply an algorithm because i this takes time , grad c: Yeah . phd b: So right now the what you 're doing is you 're taking the  , the o original version and you 're sort of channelizing yourself , right ? grad c: Yeah .  i if the time markings aren't different across channels , like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information . grad c: So , I was just  , originally I had done before like the channelized versions were coming out . grad c: phd b: So I I th I think probably the way it 'll go is that , you know , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma you know primarily come from what you 've done , we 'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals . phd b: And so it should be pretty much identical to what you have t except for the one that they 've already tightened the boundaries on . phd b: So postdoc e: Yeah ,  phd b: and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more , you know , that original version will get updated postdoc e: yeah . phd b: But the I guess the ef the effect for you guys , because you 're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones , that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing you 'd have to constantly re rerun that , grad c: I know . phd g: I I think the harder part is making sure that the transc the transcription phd b: OK . phd g: So if you b merge two things , then you know that it 's the sum of the transcripts , but if you split inside something , you don't where the word which words moved . phd g: And that 's wh that 's where it becomes a little bit  , having to rerun the processing . grad c: You know , if I just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer for an hour and a half , or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference file , that 's not a problem . And I know exactly like what the steps will work what 's going on , in the editing process , phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: So that 's I  I could there were other checks that I did , but it 's I think that we 've unless you think there 's anything else , I think that I 've covered it "

        "Summary": "The remote control design includes a double-curved plastic case in special colors, with buttons made of rubber or wood in various forms and colors. The remote does not have a clock. The cost of the remote is within budget, excluding the voice recognizer, with only 4.30 euros remaining. The price of the remote is set at 25 euros, with a production cost of 12.5 euros. The company aims to sell at least 2 million units to achieve a profit goal of 50 million euros. The target market for the remote is international, covering different users, cultures, and trends. The remote will primarily be marketed in Europe and North America, and at least 4 million units need to be sold to meet the profit goals.",
        "Article": "I don't know if  if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart , marketing: My name's Frank . They'll record  our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice .  there are also some microphones there but th  you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will  disappear when you don't attend to it . So is there a project documents folder ? There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . Well I don't know if you've noticed , but  we're working for Real Reaction . We put fashion in electronics ,  we make it work ,  we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . marketing: project manager:  maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or Let's see . project manager: I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just  if you hear something  you can write down , just write it down . No ? user interface:  ? marketing: Can't say I paid much attention to it , project manager: I can see if it works this way . project manager: Real Remote is not really the company we're we are , but it's just a little fault . project manager:  okay , what are we going to do ?  our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design ,  components design and a bit of the look and feel design .  the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project  product ev evaluation . We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . N  these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little  piece of drawing . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page  in the think it is form of . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . marketing: project manager:  the only thing we have to  look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then  the pen won't hold up . user interface: project manager: These are not very much , but   , see you have to do it real slow . project manager: Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin , user interface: project manager: but I think his nose has to be a little bit marketing: user interface: project manager: But it's close . I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . project manager: Is your cat , or did you find him on the street ? industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: Well , it's supposed to be a cat . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask marketing: Yeah . marketing: project manager:  as you can see , we  for our remote control , a selling price is  twenty five Euros .  that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims .  we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Our production cost  can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million  , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . marketing: So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? user interface:  ? project manager:  maybe you have to say the magic word . But so  does everybody has  experiences with  remote controls , and  not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? marketing: user interface:  . marketing: Well , we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . marketing: And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . And you can  program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . project manager: And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . marketing: Oh project manager: So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor .  but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . project manager: And other functions for a remote control ? Maybe we can make it   user interface: user interface: you never no know  , marketing: So user interface: I w   project manager: Waterproof . But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . project manager: No ? user interface: project manager: Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work <doc-sep>marketing: Hello project manager:  like before we  I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting marketing:  it was discussed in the last meeting  which was opened by the presentation from the interface  designer that  looks would be very important on this new remote user interface: Designer . It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera .  speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal  features she would like see d d to be integrated in this  in this new remote . user interface: project manager:  marketing: And she was challenged on that point project manager: that's right . industrial designer: project manager: But  her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful .  technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the  to the generat to the generator amplification and  the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature  to to to consider . project manager: She would like  this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip  scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . The marketing expert  who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . To do that  maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . And the decision that we took last time was that  the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery  should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . industrial designer:  and it's it's blue in colour  bright and  it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons marketing: industrial designer:   and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . marketing: You used to have all the buttons user interface: industrial designer:  yeah and   the material which we are going to use for the case is  plastic and  w which which is s strong   and also  for the  the material is plastic and  for the buttons it is  s soft rubber  and als marketing: Oh that's good , industrial designer: yeah . industrial designer: Yeah because   you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . industrial designer: And then   for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green marketing: Now these features includes the s  signal emitting  signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . user interface: we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness marketing: Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . marketing: The next channel in the numeric pattern , or user interface: No , swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . user interface: And at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . user interface: give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective . industrial designer: marketing: Okay , well  what what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , user interface: Yes , yes . marketing: that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands industrial designer: marketing: and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ? project manager: Yes the buttons are all raised , right ? marketing: The buttons are all raised project manager: Are raised , marketing: and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , project manager: Right . user interface: industrial designer: marketing:  and  I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . project manager: Yes , and it sort of sticks up so that you really marketing: Yeah , that's great . project manager: you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah ,  the  these buttons  around here are the mute user interface: No , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . project manager: So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . marketing: And this brings the menu up on the screen ? user interface: Pardon me ? This is the menu yes , yes . marketing: This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are user interface: A the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , marketing: Okay . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Okay and now I'm supposed to project manager: Well , I have one question marketing: yeah . project manager:  will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? user interface: Yes , it will have  these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . project manager: Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it user interface: Yes , which can be easily recognised . marketing: Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Text that we can have on the case itself , project manager: That's right . user interface: And and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . marketing: Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow industrial designer: marketing: and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that user interface: project manager: Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? marketing: So project manager: That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual marketing: I think voice recognition is our big selling point industrial designer:  . project manager: And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . marketing: So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image  play with the visual and then the voice recognition . project manager: Okay , now  having said that marketing: I'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't I ? project manager: No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we  just have done . marketing: Ah , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something . marketing: Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? Or project manager: Oh , okay yeah , okay , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  electronics , simple chip on print ? Is that's what we're using ? user interface: Yes . project manager:  but , yes but industrial designer: I think  that is  f for rubbers that is  yeah case material . project manager: That's just for the case material , user interface: Is this for the case ? Yes . project manager: so special colours though , we having that , marketing: Oh okay , the - , ' kay . marketing: 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , right ? project manager: No . project manager: button supplement special colour ? user interface: Speci Yes project manager: Special form ? user interface: Yes d we do have special form . user interface: One two three four five six seven eight nine project manager:  ? industrial designer: Maybe it is it just n project manager: Eight , eight point two . marketing: Okay , well  obviously my method for  s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . marketing: We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . marketing: And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . marketing: And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons industrial designer: marketing: and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . industrial designer: marketing: So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel  and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . marketing: They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . The size is small  and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . I think that it's I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven . And then functionality  I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . marketing: So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . project manager: And  I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . marketing: Well ,  we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? project manager: Eight , eight twenty , yes . industrial designer: Eight twenty so marketing: And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend . industrial designer: We have  four euros , yeah project manager:  maximum we have another four point three euros  four thirty . Well  that's project manager: But  we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . marketing: Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . project manager: I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just  recog I just remembered that there was no that that was not  included  that there was no room for any special features , okay ? industrial designer: Included , yeah . You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ? marketing: well I isn't this my last slide ? project manager: I dunno .  and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . project manager: Why ? Wh why you need that up ? marketing:  ? Well because I can't remember what I put on there . Okay user interface: marketing: you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . user interface: industrial designer: marketing:  and then how about how we doing on colour ? project manager: Colour  I marketing: Colour , I gave it a one . marketing: Okay , I gave it a three , two , user interface: I'll give three . marketing: And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but project manager: Well it's also you can't really try it out  the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view marketing: Yeah .  the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . marketing: But  otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product . Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? project manager:  . Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? user interface: We can always improve , yes .  I think they are quite big , so I think I  we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . Well then again if we're gonna  do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . marketing: So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . marketing:  and a couple of other th maybe comp  consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . project manager: Y  al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget industrial designer: user interface: And maybe project manager: and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just  add a whole lot of more things . project manager:   we need  you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . project manager: So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ?  ,  are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ?  I think personally I think  I'm pretty happy . marketing: I'm pretty happy with it too , yeah  , project manager:  an industrial designer: Even I'm happy . project manager: and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?  marketing: I think you've done a good job , Miss leader . project manager: And I think team work I think was very very good , I think we really industrial designer: project manager: And  I think we are we happy with the means we used ? We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things . marketing: Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , user interface: Whiteboard more , yes , yes .  , it's maybe not in the best position in the room  you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit . project manager: I think we we did ,  in more than one respect and  so I think we did very well here . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: project manager: So I I thank you all very much . project manager: I always get it on here , but getting it off is industrial designer: Do we do we have some time left ?  you have user interface: They say it's forty minutes . project manager: Ah yes we have time later marketing: But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished . marketing: It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace <doc-sep>project manager:  before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in ,  because we're  being watched by  Big Brother . And  as I can see you  you have placed your laptops  exactly on the place where it must be . And that has to do with the camera settings , so we don't have our  laptops in front of the cameras . So  what are we going  to  to do ? What are we going to   make f  kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design .  because at the detailed design , how , part two ,  we go  to dig in  really about how the the te the technical of If it's  it's possible technical-wise . marketing: project manager:  each stage is   is broken up in two  two stages , individual work and a meeting . This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you  you had .  This  is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't  gonna explain it all , marketing: project manager: because I think you know  how it works . Every  every one of us  must draw our favourite animal , industrial designer: project manager: and  tell  tell us why we  had  chosen that animal . project manager: Yes ? marketing:  this exercise ,  did the company board tell you to do it , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: or  did you just make it up yourself ? project manager: No no no . So getting used to each other , we can  have a little fun then , before we  dig in really to the hard stuff . marketing: project manager: My favourite animal huh ? industrial designer: marketing: It's like Pictionary ? industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , you can guess what it is . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: It's a pork ? project manager: No , it's not an orc . user interface: project manager: You don't see it  at the ears ? marketing:  yeah , I have it at home . industrial designer: marketing: Miniature size ? project manager: So we  found it kinda cool to  name it after a lion . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: project manager: So choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a user interface: You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during  the drawing . industrial designer: By the way , why was your cat  red ? project manager: Because  my cat is red  at home . project manager: user interface: Huh ? industrial designer: user interface: Oh , it is a turtle . project manager: You watched it a lot ? user interface: industrial designer: marketing:  ? project manager: You watched it a lot ? user interface: It's  inside its shell .  marketing: industrial designer: user interface: How did it work ? project manager: Format ? And then you have the the current colour , user interface: Performance ? project manager: you can change . marketing: project manager: Tim had  Tim , what kinda line width did you have ? user interface:  marketing:  the big lines were like nine . Why a dog ? You have a dog at home ? user interface: Well , we had a dog , a few years ago . project manager: Had a dog ? marketing: it's p project manager: Yeah ? user interface: And and it , yeah , when it died we didn't get a new one or something . user interface: But  marketing: It's pretty good  industrial designer: project manager: You have an artistic  inner middle . marketing: Wha user interface: Well , project manager: Okay , user interface: it's okay . user interface: industrial designer: I figure I should do something like that , project manager: industrial designer: but I'm gonna do something much more difficult . user interface: Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there  . But at the other hand ,  a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and project manager: No . user interface: Than on the , with project manager: user interface: Yeah , I m  like  like on here , drawing drawing  . user interface: marketing: Project Manager ?  project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: Where does the pen go ? Just  marketing: Have you been  counting the time ? project manager: Yeah , a little . project manager:  the selling price for the remote will be  twenty five Euro , and the production cost  may not be more than  twenty and a half Euro . So  from my point of view , I don't think it's  gonna be very  very high tech , high definition ,  ultra modern  kinda remote , for twelve  fift  twelve and a half Euro . We have to sell  a lot of  user interface: Yeah , how much is it ? marketing: Like how much ? user interface: Hundred million  remotes or something ? project manager:  I think  w when the selling price is twenty five ,   you got two million , two million remotes . Well what what's the most  important thing at a remote control ? user interface:  well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . So not a not a remote control who   which can  can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only marketing: Yeah . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ? project manager: If you have them on  I can  marketing: Yeah . Between the the the , yeah , the the  user interface: marketing: Screen ? project manager: Yeah , be The screens . user interface: Is it possible to open pen drawings in this  on this screen ? project manager: No no no . Only All the drawings go there , at the left  user interface:  but  which The ones we made on the project manager: Oh , that pen drawings .  no , I think  when it is  in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there .  I think , it doesn't have to matter  which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . marketing: And  by making it multi-purpose , it  has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from  from current products .  I rather find it very annoying  , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . It's nice as an added feature feature , that  , when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen  what programmes are coming up or project manager: Okay . project manager: remote ? Yeah , it must be really  innovative , technical-wise ? marketing: Yeah , it has to be  Yeah , our company is very  good in making new innovative  things . user interface: We marketing: So i i i i project manager: So we must focus on things who are really  really add something to  to marketing: To the current market . But we have to keep an eye that it's  at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very  cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . project manager:  but we must not  lose  sight of the the user   friendly  marketing: Yeah , of course . So  you  will have  individual actions where I presume  will be some feedback ,  via the m the mail .  one thing  , project manager: Yeah ? user interface: we must first agree on  what we're going to m going to make . Do we Are we going to use  it it for multiple systems ? Or  We should have some agreement on that before we project manager: Okay .  wha marketing:   I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . But maybe , because  you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we  must  have a little or kinda    How do you call it ?  user interface: Consensus on the , what we're gonna do . So you don't   come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . project manager: W He says user interface: if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . user interface: Or do we use it a text screen ? Or  will it be with  with bluetooth or project manager: Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say  is it   one way or multi-purpose , that's a user interface: Okay . marketing: Like we all have a list of  things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . project manager: each individually i individually  must think on what's  at  his point of view is the most important <doc-sep>user interface: No I don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length . I thin industrial designer: Yeah but the the mic should not user interface: It's not a directional mic , anyway . project manager: So w we will try to structure this  meeting with an a with an agenda  as presented here . So ,  We have been provided with  some  w technical tools to  to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans  as I can say  so w we will also try to  to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . You all know I hope how it's about  the  new r remote control we are going going to design . project manager:  then we will  discuss  , well , how it should be and  wh what  what our new product should look lite like . Be  we want to be distinguished ,  ? People  want to  when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . But then , it also should work  user friendly and  otherwise people   well it will not be  be rated very well in consumer  articles and like that . industrial designer: project manager: So , the general outline of  new project will be we first  go through a functional design phase .  You all get   certain task  in this  in this phase and  then we will meet again and  discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the  ph two phases  after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . In all in front of you  you see  the  notebooks and w  n note blocks and we have here a a a a white-board . project manager: And  well it should work  I've read it from my  from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so  industrial designer: Under documents in the shared folder . Do Do we have to say something about that ? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder  . industrial designer: Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder  with documents that we can share . Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet . project manager: Well , yes ,  we  we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I I'm not really sure how this works , but industrial designer: Okay , shall I start ? marketing:  . marketing: I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . user interface: industrial designer: But it's marketing: industrial designer: Actually , I think I cannot go with  project manager: You you D doesn't it work ? Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start . project manager: So  L Why don't you draw  your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . industrial designer: user interface: You know ? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that . project manager: So , marketing: It's not a cat , project manager: that's the cat . project manager: So but that's also kind of cat , user interface: Oh project manager: isn't it ? user interface: the dog doesn't have a tail ? marketing: It's got a tail then .  d did you  work out cord ? industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And you guessed cats without a tail . industrial designer: right ? user interface: It'll still not extend , right ? It's not up to that . So marketing: Ah project manager: I suppose it user interface: Ah I think you can put that . user interface: I'll tell to get it off my project manager: Ma Matthew ? user interface:  ? project manager: industrial designer: And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ? marketing: So you've all drawn land animals , marketing: project manager: so why not draw an animal from the water . user interface: The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ? industrial designer: With different pen widths . marketing: project manager: Oh , yes , why not ? industrial designer: project manager: Good idea . user interface: you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ? industrial designer: Oh . So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually But  user interface: You should go for the next one it seems to me .  when we are and when w you are  going to design w  we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product  will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project  I also look at you  Mael , keep in mind    People  user interface: Twenty four .  industrial designer: project manager: more interesting for our company of course , p  profit aim , about fifty million Euro .  we will try to  to get at a international market  so  it will be I think mainly Europe and  Northern America , user interface: Ah yeah , the sale man , four million .  also important for you all is  the the product  production cost must be maximal  twelve  twelve Euro and fifty cents .    we still have to  to make a profit , huh ? user interface: They have to sell at least four million to make a profit industrial designer: Of course . project manager: Excuse me ? user interface: Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . project manager: So  well I think w when we are working on the international market ,  in principle it has enough customers industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  so when we have a good product we  we could  meet this this aim , I think . And  now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and  well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . project manager: Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality  of a remote control . user interface: You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way , marketing:  . Th th that's very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels . user interface: and industrial designer: And  just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we are the marketing guy ? Or marketing: I'm marketing . project manager: So user interface: I thi think you know me , industrial designer:  so yeah  Just  on your web page but  yeah not  not face to face . project manager: Are there some other very important things to to do well , user interface: So industrial designer: So I project manager: to specify in this first phase of of the project . user interface: And  , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then you  project manager: Yes . project manager: well  I I think  w y you two should should , I think , think this over  w espec what , what functionality . industrial designer: Actually , yeah user interface: Let's Let's take industrial designer: w Of course , and first before  designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . industrial designer:  then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with   T_V_ over I_P_ . But Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit , so   the the very fancy stuff  w we can leave that out , I think . project manager: So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . user interface: Oh in that case you can you always hook up with  someone who is providing that and you know , you you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . project manager: Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons  that will be on it . project manager: well just just for the next meeting ,  user interface: L project manager: well , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general ,  so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . project manager:  you will be working on on technical function design , so user interface: Yeah , sure . project manager: eh ? Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at basic basic television  interface "

They also criticized the rigidity and difficulty of the rent relief program. The Prime Minister reiterated that the government's priority has always been to support workers in need and prevent job losses across all organizations and companies. The Minister of Canadian Heritage emphasized the government's commitment to transparency during the crisis, but the opposition party questioned the allocation of $35 billion in infrastructure funds, suspecting that it may have been used for personal salaries. The government assured that they have been actively exploring ways to enhance contact tracing capabilities in collaboration with provinces, territories, and volunteer organizations, while also addressing concerns raised by the Privacy Commissioner regarding privacy and ethical considerations. Additionally, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced a funding of $500 million to support Canada's arts, sports, and cultural sectors, with further details to be released in the coming days.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. garnett genuis (sherwood parkfort saskatchewan, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. the chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. darrell samson (sackvilleprestonchezzetcook, lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, we've seen a disproportionate number of deaths in long-term care homes. I'm thankful for the Canadian Armed Forces who were deployed to the Altamont care home in my riding and four other facilities across the GTA. They include residents being given expired or improper doses of medication; not being cleaned or changed for a prolonged period of time; being forcibly fed, causing choking; being bed-bound for weeks; receiving inadequate nutrition, and much more. Chair, I call upon Premier Ford to place these five homes under a mandatory management order and to appoint a third party manager to address and rectify these violations. I also call upon the Premier to undertake an independent public inquiry into the tragedy we face in long-term care facilities across Ontario. Chair, we need to work with the provinces and territories to set national standards of care for the most vulnerable in our society. I hesitate to interrupt colleagues, but I'm concerned about the petition practice, which, as I understand it, is to summarize a petition but not make a speech. the chair: I will remind honourable members that when a petition is presented, we're expected to give a prcis and make it as concise as possible. martin champoux (drummond, bq): Mr.Chair, I would like to recognize the resilience of Quebeckers concerned for their jobs or their businesses during the COVID-19 crisis. That is why the Bloc Qubcois is demanding that the government present an economic update, and that it do so before June17. In closing, I would like to remind the government that one group is not really contributing to the public purse at the moment. I am talking about the tech giants, the GAFAM group, that have never before been used to the extent that they are now, and that are still not paying a cent in tax in Canada. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Peel region police, paramedic and firefighting services for keeping Bramptonians safe. Organizations such as the Khalsa Aid Society, the Interfaith Council of Peel, the Brampton YMCA, the Prayer Stone Peoples Church, Unity in the Community, Ste. Louise Outreach Centre, Knights Table, the Yogi Divine Society, Vraj Community Service, Regeneration Brampton and many more have made our community stronger during this difficult time. Like many Canadians, I was shocked by this report from the long-term care centres, including one in my riding. Chair, Canada's oil and gas sector is in crisis, made worse by five years of bad policies, red tape and barriers to pipelines. Active rigs dropped by 92% and tens of thousands of oil and gas workers lost their jobs, adding to the 200,000 since 2015. Energy is Canada's biggest investor, and exporting could lead the recovery if there are actions, not just words. On March 25, the finance minister promised help in hours or days, not weeks, but he's letting Canadians down. Sixty-three days later, small oil and gas companies still can't apply for BDC loans, and last week's large employer loan terms are predatory, with interest rates escalating to 14% by year five. The Liberals' death-by-delay tactics are doing exactly what foreign activists in other countries want: to shut down Canada's oil. lyne bessette (bromemissisquoi, lib.): Mr.Chair, in times of crisis, we stick together. In the last weeks, I have been calling volunteer action centres in my constituency so that they can tell me their news. I would like to take the time that I have to highlight the work that community organizations are doing tirelessly in my constituency. The crisis has made us realize the extent to which food banks and meals-on-wheels can not only relieve hunger, but also relieve thousands of shut-in seniors of their loneliness. Let me also highlight the devotion of the volunteers giving generously of their time, particularly the initiative of Mabel Hastings in the volunteer aid centre in Mansonville. Like me, she sends out a daily newsletter to keep the public informed about the many resources available for their support. COVID-19 is bringing out the best in our community and I am certain that, together, we will get through it. Chair, during the COVID-19 pandemic I have been inspired by the courageous work of so many essential workers. I want to thank everyone on the front lines for keeping us safe, keeping us fed and keeping our communities functioning. I want to make special note of one particular essential health care worker, a woman who is a quarantine manager with the Public Health Agency of Canada. Suchi, I love you, I am very proud of you and I thank you for all of the sacrifices you are making. I want to highlight another woman from my riding of ParkdaleHigh Park, Rachelle LeBlanc. When the pandemic broke, she saw the need for protective barriers for small shops in Parkdale, so she set about collecting donations. Rachelle's team has now delivered 25 free COVID protective shields to small shopkeepers in Parkdale, and the team is on track to building 100 more. It's the compassion of Canadians like Rachelle that gives meaning to the phrase we are all in this together. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): Mr.Chair, the school year has been shattered and our graduating classes must be proud of what they have achieved amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The current government has the obligation to promote the values that will lead you to become involved in your communities. I implore this government, which is unaware of the damage it is causing, to immediately announce all the positions that have already been approved under the Canada summer jobs program. Let us have confidence in our organizations, our companies, and let us support our youth, a rich resource that we must equip and motivate. I congratulate all the young graduates in the beautiful constituency of PortneufJacques-Cartier. greg fergus (hullaylmer, lib.): Mr.Chair, this pandemic lets us see what Canadians are made of. This coming Saturday, May30, more than 2,000Christians of all denominations are coming together virtually for prayer and for action. This Saturday, in more than 2,000 churches and homes, thousands of faith-filled Canadians are gathering to pray and act on those prayers as part of Stand United Canada. Then they are going to deliver much-needed support to at-risk Canadians who live in disadvantaged areas. rachael harder (lethbridge, cpc): The best way to safeguard the truth is to allow people to speak freely, but from the very beginning of this pandemic, the Liberals have silenced dissent. Early on, they propagated the notion that human-to-human transmission wasn't possible. It is undeniable that the Liberal government has put Canadians in danger by silencing alternative points of view and has spread misinformation. They are determining what is true and what is not, what is right and what is wrong, what is in and what is out. I call upon the government to restore the personal liberties that are granted under our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They provide employment and economic stability and are always the first to support community functions and activities, but small businesses have been particularly hard hit due to COVID-19. They have shut their doors temporarily, and now many worry they'll never be able to open their doors again. With the season cancellations at the Stratford Festival, Drayton Entertainment and Stratford Summer Music, businesses in the tourism, hospitality, accommodation and retail sectors in PerthWellington are struggling. Every day, I talk to small business owners who can't access the Canada emergency business account, and others who find the convoluted commercial rent assistance program to be out of reach. Chair, the government needs to go back, fix these programs and ensure that support goes to the small businesses that need it. We can go backwards to so-called business as usual, with horrific conditions in long-term care homes, widespread inequality and no real action on climate change, or we can build for better. In Victoria, people in the community, organizations and municipal leaders have been calling for a new way forward. Organizations like Greater Victoria Acting Together; Common Vision, Common Action; and Kairos Victoria are exploring ideas for a sustainable and just recovery. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, in this time of pandemic, it is with heartfelt emotion that I want to highlight the excellent work of all the guardian angels at the CISSS de la Montrgie-Ouest. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank the entire staff, as well as the retirees who have come back to provide their assistance. I admire the managers, at all levels and in all services, working tirelessly so that their teams can answer the call in this difficult situation. My fellow managers and the management teams of the Support Program for the Autonomy of Seniors, both in home support and in residential care, you have my heartfelt congratulations for the herculean work you have done. My thoughts go particularly to Lyne Ricard and Vronique Proulx, managers working diligently with their teams of professionals to support the seniors living in intermediate resources, as we call them. I also warmly recognize the director of nursing services, Chantal Careau, who is facing the current challenge with passion and humanity. Once again, my congratulations go to the entire organization of the CISSS de la Montrgie-Ouest for their remarkable work in this difficult and very demanding time. john barlow (foothills, cpc): During the worst of times, we see the best in people. I cannot say enough about my constituents in Foothillsfront-line health care workers, grocery store clerks, restaurateurs, farmersfor all they are doing to keep our community safe and healthy. I want to shine a light on some of our hidden heroes, such as Owen Plumb, a grade 9 student in Okotoks who is using his 3D printer to build PPE for front-line health care workers. He partnered with the Rotary Club and Evergreen Solutions in Okotoks to help with the manufacturing and assembly. There is also Sam Schofield, the volunteer president of the Pincher Creek Chamber of Commerce, overnight built a resiliency website for COVID-19 by building training tools for businesses throughout his area. He also helped develop the Foothills Business Recovery Taskforce, which is a resource for businesses throughout southern Alberta in my riding. Finally, to the employees of Cargill Foods in High River, I know this has been a very difficult time and that many of you have lost loved ones. I want to say thank you for tirelessly doing all you can to protect our food supply and keep food on our table. scott simms (coast of bayscentralnotre dame, lib.): Thank you, Chair. I would like to take this time to salute those who go above and beyond the call of duty to provide care and comfort to others. In my 16 years in the House of Commons I have never experienced anything like this, when we find our lives are at a standstill and there is so much sorrow felt by families who suffer from the effects of COVID-19. Shanna and Fred Patey of Bishop's Falls, along with a few of their friends, spend hours next to the Trans-Canada Highway with just a barbeque and a cooler. There is also Mitch Strickland of Grand Falls-Windsor, who owns Appy's Diner. To all our front-line workers in grocery stores and delivery trucks, and to doctors, nurses, LPNs, paramedics, first responders and, of course, our brave women and men in the military, we will be forever grateful and blessed because of you. members: Hear, hear! the chair: That's all the time we have today for Statements by Members. Before going on, I just want to remind all the members that it is a one-minute statement, so if you don't mind, please time it before coming in because we do have limited time. I'm not here to judge anybody's way of speaking, but try to consider the translators and interpreters to make sure that everyone understands what is said, because they are working diligently to try to get both languages out. In sum, there are two things: please slow down and please make sure the statement is confined to one minute. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes in order to allow the employees who are providing support for the sitting to substitute for each other safely. In the early days of the pandemic and the lockdown that followed, Canadians were told by this government that programs would be rolled out very quickly and that gaps and shortcomings would be changed as time went on. While many Canadians are being let down by this government's response and its unnecessarily rigid programs, Conservatives identified solutions weeks ago, yet here we are, two and a half months later, and many of these programs still have not been improved. On April 26 the Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that don't happen to have a business bank account could qualify for those types of programs. Chair, we knew from the beginning of this pandemic that we did need to move extremely quickly, and that's what we did. Eight million Canadians have had that as a replacement for paycheques lost because of COVID-19. We also moved forward on the wage subsidy and a range of other programs to support workers and small businesses. What we've done in terms of helping small businesses with the Canada emergency business account has had a massive impact on small businesses across the country, but we understand that certain companies and businesses have particularities that mean it's a little more difficult for them to qualify. We are working with them through their regional development agencies, and we encourage them to approach their local RDAs, which will be able to help them get the money they deserve. They're trying to get patted on the back for actions they took back in March, and yet they are letting so many Canadians down by not making these very simple changes. Will companies that have acquired another company still be allowed to use the wage subsidy to keep workers on the job, yes or no? right hon. We have moved forward on supporting as many of them as we possibly can, and we continue to work on filling gaps. I know the member opposite has talked to me a number of times about a tractor company in his riding. I can assure you that finance officials are engaged with that company to see if there's a way to make sure we're getting them the support they need. He can make this very clear, and save a lot of work, just by including the word acquisition. They're continuing to work with a range of businesses across the country that, for various reasons, are not able to apply for the help we have now. The government has set the parameters to qualify for the rent relief program for companies that have experienced a 70% revenue loss. There are untold thousands of businesses that have experienced a 50%, 55%, 60% or 65% loss that are ineligible but have no capacity to pay the rent. We called on the government weeks ago to have a more flexible sliding scale to allow more companies to access this program to keep more people on the job and more businesses open. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, our public servants and policy-makers have been moving creatively and quickly to try to get help to as many people as we possibly can, with our focus being on the people who need it the most. Obviously, this pandemic is affecting everyone and every business across the country in different ways, but our focus has been on ensuring that those who most need it are getting the help they can. We will, of course, continue to work with the parties opposite and all Canadians to ensure that we're getting help to everyone who needs it, but our focus has always been on the most vulnerable, first and foremost. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. If the Liberal Party of Canada had not taken advantage of the emergency programs, would it have laid off all its staff? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we recognized that a number of organizations and companies were facing difficulties because of COVID-19. People work for those organizations, as accountants, receptionists, assistants or labourers, and those people need to be supported. yves-franois blanchet: Is the Liberal Party one of those organizations in difficulty? right hon. justin trudeau: Any company or organization that can demonstrate a significant drop in its income, whether that be in donations, receipts, profits the chair: The floor goes to Mr.Blanchet. yves-franois blanchet: Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization? right hon. yves-franois blanchet: In the Magdalen Islands, fishing companies in difficulty and in need of assistance will not have the money that the Liberals are going to take. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we have invested in assistance for fishers all across the country. Compared to that company, is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization? right hon. yves-franois blanchet: If the program criteria establish that the Liberal Party is an organization in difficulty, does that mean that the criteria to determine whether an organization is in difficulty are poorly designed? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, all through this pandemic, our priority has been to be here for workers in difficulty so that they do not lose their jobs. yves-franois blanchet: Given the answers from the Prime Minister, let me ask this question: is the Prime Minister in difficulty? right hon. yves-franois blanchet: Restaurant owners on rue Ontario in Montreal feel that they will not make it through the crisis and that they will never open their doors again. By comparison, is the Liberal Party of Canada an organization in difficulty that will not open its doors again after the crisis? We can but hope. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we established criteria for that program in order to help those working for various organizations. yves-franois blanchet: Is there a consensus in the Liberal Party caucus that the Liberal Party is in difficulty as an organization? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are working every day to help Canadians and workers in difficulty. yves-franois blanchet: Does answering a question put the Prime Minister in difficulty? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, it is a pleasure to be here in the House and to answer questions from Canadians and from members of the opposition. yves-franois blanchet: You are going to answer a question from a Quebecker, I hope. Would those companies not deserve to be saved by the money that the supposedly struggling Liberal Party has taken? right hon. justin trudeau: I am always very happy to answer questions from all Canadians currently sitting in the House. yves-franois blanchet: If the Prime Minister is so happy to answer questions, I hope he will be delirious with joy to answer this one. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we established a program to help those working in organizations and who could lose their jobs because of COVID-19. The conditions of seniors as outlined by the military were appalling, but seniors need more than just compassionate words. Will the Prime Minister stop hiding behind excuses and actually show leadership to fix long-term care? right hon. It lays out the divisions of powers and responsibilities, and we respect the provinces' jurisdiction over long-term care facilities. However, from the very beginning, we have indicated our willingness to support the provinces on this very important issue. We need to make sure our seniors right across the country are properly cared for, which is why we sent in the military and why we are there to help the provinces. Philpott, said, We need to stop using jurisdiction as an excuse to not have federal leadership. Now, we know from the military report that staff were afraid to use vital equipment because of the cost. Chair, over the past couple of days I've had very good conversations with the premiers of both Quebec and Ontario on this important issue. I look forward to discussing issues around long-term care with all the premiers of the provinces and territories tomorrow evening as well. Ontarians and indeed people right across the country are deeply preoccupied by what they've seen going on. jagmeet singh: The military report found that cockroaches and flies were present and that food was rotten. Will the Prime Minister call for national standards so that long-term care is governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act? right hon. Chair, our priority right now is ensuring that we are supporting the provinces in their need to make sure that all seniors are protected right across the country in all those institutions. Going forward, we absolutely will need to have more conversations about how we can ensure that every senior across the country is properly supported. Will the Prime Minister call for national standards and for long-term care to be governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act? right hon. This is something we all take very seriously, and all orders of government will work together to make sure that right now, and going forward, we improve our systems. We need a commitment at the federal level that the Prime Minister will push for things that people need, which is to remove profit from long-term care and to establish national standards. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, I will always be here to stand up for Canadians in all different situations. We are going to work with the provinces, fully respecting jurisdictions, to make sure that, all across the country, Canadians in long-term care are supported as required and receive the services and the care they deserve. The COVID-19 crisis should not be used as an excuse to avoid presenting solutions to the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls committee, in particular by delaying action on the calls for justice. This is the same government that would not recognize it as a genocide, the same government that delayed the United Nations declaration legislation and the same government that is still taking indigenous kids to court. Will this government commit to core funding for indigenous services to help women and girls and ensure that the calls for justice are implemented without delay? right hon. Chair, we continue to work very closely with partners on the calls for justice even as we act in many areas, including better funding for shelters and for victims of domestic violence. We will continue to work with those partners, but people will understand that many of those partners are very focused right now on helping front-line workers, not on establishing the report. We will continue to work with them on the report, but the COVID-19 situation has made that more difficult. the chair: I want to thank the honourable members who are shouting time, but I do have a timer here, and I am taking care of it. He was just talking about the tragic conditions in long-term care facilities in Ontario, and there was a report out from Quebec today. I want to commend the Canadian Armed Forces for witnessing these appalling conditions, putting it in the context of a report, and providing care to our loved ones in these long-term care facilities. The government is saying they didn't receive the report from the department until May 22, but this report came out on May 14. I then forwarded it to the Minister of Public Safety on the 22nd, and that report was then given to the provincial authorities very quickly afterwards. james bezan: I trust that you got the report on the 21st, but the report was written on the 14th, so what happened with that report for seven days? Why wasn't it acted upon? Could you just explain that? Our loved ones were at risk during that entire time. Chair, as we stated, this report was done and given up through the chain of command, and the appropriate leadership did their due diligence. Again, I want to commend our Canadian Armed Forces members for not only the tremendous work they are doing but also for doing their duty. james bezan: That report from Ontario documented appalling conditions, horrific care that was being given to the clients, and also the way that the staff conducted themselves. Minister, do you believe that the infection could have been transmitted from staff to our soldiers serving in long-term care facilities because proper protocols were not being followed? hon. Chair, when it comes to any type of activities that we send our Canadian Armed Forces on, we do our due diligence to make sure that we have the right protocols in place and the appropriate training. This is why we have taken the time to make sure our folks not only did the appropriate training but had the appropriate equipment. We have the right protocols in place, and we will make sure that our members who are infected by COVID will get the appropriate treatment as well. james bezan: Does the Minister of National Defence believe that our soldiers serving in Operation Laser, who have put themselves in harm's way in battling the COVID virus as a war, deserve to have hazard pay benefits? hon. Chair, when it comes to looking after Canadian Armed Forces personnel, yes, we are actually in the process as we speak of making sure that our members have the appropriate hazard pay. I would finally like to come back to the issue of the timeline from May 14 to May 21, when that report was in the department for one week. Will the minister take responsibility for that report sitting on someone's desk for seven days and not being turned over to the proper authorities? hon. Chair, I want to make it very clear: When it comes to the observations that were made, those were immediately reported to the appropriate management of the care facilities and to the appropriate links within the province. At the same time, this report was being compiled and pushed up to the chain of command, and they did their due diligence. As I stated, it was given to us, and on the same day it was forwarded to the Minister of Public Safety, who immediately then sent it to the provincial authorities. Chair, as stated, this will not only be given to the proper authorities but the appropriate steps will be taken now. rosemarie falk (battlefordslloydminster, cpc): Thank you, Chair. Yesterday it was revealed that the Minister of Digital Government has been promoting a fundraising campaign to sue Global News for their story criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. Why is the minister using her authority to support the Communist Party of China and threatening our media and freedom of expression? hon. WeChat is a social media platform used to engage and share information with the chair: Now we'll go back to Ms. rosemarie falk: Is the minister aware of the efforts that the United Front carries out on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party to influence how Canadians view the People's Republic of China? hon. The participation in the WeChat group, much like Facebook, is guided by posted the chair: We'll now go back to Ms. rosemarie falk: Is the minister an active participant in the efforts by the Communists to muzzle a Canadian journalist and deprive Canadians of the facts about China? hon. I will say that the individual in question posted something outside of the guidelines of my WeChat group and is no longer the chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Falk, I just want to point out that we do have interpreters listening and trying to interpret. joyce murray: I think the member knows very well that the people who post on WeChat are free to post what they choose within certain guidelines. rosemarie falk: Chair, Sam Cooper is an investigative Canadian journalist who has uncovered many different criminal rackets that can be linked back to Beijing. joyce murray: As we all know, community outreach is a very important part of the work of a member of Parliament. WeChat is one of many social media sites regularly used by members the chair: We go back to Ms. rosemarie falk: Chair, when will the minister apologize to Sam Cooper and Global News? hon. Chair, I have been very clear that I do not share the views of the person who posted on my WeChat site, who operated outside of my the chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Chair, I want to assure the member that we are always vigilant in any foreign interference in our national security or issues of political interference in our society. It's monitored carefully by the national security establishment, according to the law as it exists in this country, and we will remain vigilant. Will the Liberals hold Joyce Murray's WeChat accountable if it has violated this part of the charter? hon. I think, as the minister has made very clear, she was not involved in this process and has no control over the individual who posted that matter. Will the government hold Joyce Murray's WeChat accountable if it has violated their part of the charter? hon. Chair, I want to assure the member that our government remains committed to the rule of law and we will always work tirelessly to uphold the laws of this country. rosemarie falk: Still, was that a yes or a no? I'm not hearing a yes or a no. Chair, to answer the question for the House and to assure the member opposite that our government will always remain committed to the rule of law. grard deltell (louis-saint-laurent, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. bill morneau (minister of finance): Mr.Chair, we continue to be transparent with our measures. Of course, we want to make sure that our investments, our economy the chair: The floor is yours, Mr.Deltell. grard deltell: Let me ask my question to the honourable Minister of Finance once more, since he is talking about transparency. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, the Minister of Finance may not know what the deficit is, but one great Canadian does know. Could the Minister of Finance be very clear, very fluid and, above all, very transparent with Canadians? What is Canada's deficit? hon. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, I want to be very clear with Canadians: our economic situation is very difficult. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, with all due respect to the Minister of Finance, let me point out that, though he is not very clear, Canada's Parliamentary Budget Officer was clear yesterday. Why does the government not have the courage to state it clearly, as the Parliamentary Budget Officer did yesterday? hon. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, I know that the Minister of Finance is very good with figures. Perhaps he could comment on the statement that the Parliamentary Budget Officer made yesterday, that the emergency assistance must have an end date, and if it does not, we are heading to levels of taxation that have not been seen in this country for generations. What is the government going to do to make sure that Canadians will not be overtaxed after this crisis? hon. When we have more information, we will the chair: Mr.Deltell, you have the floor. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, will the minister commit not to raise taxes after the crisis? hon. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, I have said several times that we do not have a plan to raise taxes. grard deltell: Finally a clear answer! However, I'm not convinced that he will apply it. In fact, the Parliamentary Budget Officer himself has said that there isn't much ammunition left without shifting into a large structural deficit, which can lead directly to tax increases. If the Minister of Finance can't even say today what the deficit is today, how can he be credible when he says that he won't raise taxes? hon. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, I think what's most important is that during this pandemic, Canadians and companies across the country need the Government of Canada's help. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, all observers are expecting an economic update to know where we're going. Chair, the United States, Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam have created an economic prosperity group to diversify some of their key supply chains away from China. Indeed, we have been working diligently with all of these countries to make sure that we are keeping global supply chains open during this critical time. I think everyone agrees that keeping supply chains open for medical goods, critical agriculture and essential goods is absolutely essential and the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, this government is refusing to come to terms with what COVID-19 will mean for the future of international trade. Why is Canada not at the table with our largest trading partner protecting the viability of our international supply chains and capitalizing on the opportunities of others doing the same? the chair: Before we go to the minister, one of the members has his mike still on, and I would ask that he turn it off. Chair, Canada has unprecedented access to a number of markets around the world because of the extraordinary agreements that we have made to provide access to customers in those international markets. I have had two meetings with G20 trade ministers on the importance of keeping supply chains the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, is this payback for the Prime Minister snubbing these countries at the original TPP signing? hon. Chair, we have a CPTPP arrangement with these countries, and we are looking forward to making sure that we get Canadian businesses growing into those markets. will begin applying tariffs at the beginning of next year on Canadian exports such as seafood, beef and cars. I want to assure Canadian businesses that CETA continues to apply to our trade with the U.K. Chair, after CUSMA, this government guaranteed to the trade committee that they would publish the objectives of any new trade agreement. Chair, we look forward to working to ensure that those objectives are published as we get into future trade discussions. Chair, the resignation of the WTO director-general at this unprecedented time is concerning for the international trade community. Is the government committed to supporting a DG candidate who is dedicated to the massive reforms needed to get the WTO functioning again? hon. The Ottawa group, led by Canada, is working with like-minded countries on the reform of the WTO. I look forward to making sure that we are leading the way on those discussions with like-minded the chair: Mr. Has the government sought out and received assurances from the United States that no such action will apply to Canadian cattle? hon. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr. Chair, we have an excellent assurance of our trade with the United States, which is our new NAFTA trade agreement that we have negotiated, thanks to the unprecedented co-operation across this country. Chair, going forward post-COVID, there are a lot things that will be changing in supply chains. What is this government doing proactively to look at opportunities in these supply chains that Canadian businesses can take advantage of? hon. Chair, we continue to work with countries around the globe to ensure that Canada's supply chains and those global supply chains, particularly for essential goods, for agricultural products, for medical supplies, continue to remain open. Chair, on the agriculture side, canola farmers would like to know the status of canola going into China. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): Mr.Chair, I want to assure my colleague that we are continuing to work with our industry representatives, our allies and our trading partners in China. cathy mcleod (kamloopsthompsoncariboo, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Senior Canadian bureaucrats received very credible reports in early January that China was procuring and hoarding PPE. Chair, from the very beginning of the outbreak in early January we were aware of the challenges our health sector would face, and we immediately began to work with the provinces and territories to understand what the need would be and how we could best prepare. cathy mcleod: In April, the minister stated there were not enough supplies in the national emergency stockpile. Can she explain why she approved a donation of 16 tonnes of PPE for China on January 31, claiming it would not compromise our supply? She can't have it both ways. Chair, we are operating in a highly competitive global environment, and the reality is that we need to make sure we have multiple complementary supply chains operating at the same time, which we have been doing in the past weeks and months, to ensure our front-line health care workers have the supplies they need to keep Canadians safe. cathy mcleod: Unfortunately, this question was directed to the health minister, referencing things she actually stated in terms of the availability of our supplies. Before the she signed off on the donationand it was the health minister who signed off on the donationdid she consult with the health ministers in the provinces and territories? hon. Chair, as the member opposite knows, provinces and territories have their own stockpiles, which of course they use to prepare for incidences of outbreak and other illnesses across their jurisdictions. We've worked very closely with the provinces and territories since the beginning of the outbreak to make sure we can provide any particular additional support. cathy mcleod: Health care workers are now having to look at modified full-face snorkels as an alternative to N95 masks. Did it not occur to the minister that our hospitals and care homes could have used that PPE she shipped out, providing a longer opportunity for them to also get procurement done? hon. Chair, as the member opposite knows, the equipment that was donated when China was in its outbreak was an important donation of nearly expired or expired goods that it was in desperate need of in its effort to try to contain the virus. As the member opposite knows, we've been able to work successfully with provinces and territories to ensure they have what they need. Chair, I would suggest that during February and March our hospitals would have consumed that almost-expired product very efficiently, but I want to move on to another topic. When defending the sale of 22 seniors' homes to the Chinese government, the Prime Minister stated that we have a strong regulatory regime that imposes rigorous standards. Was the Prime Minister completely oblivious to the risks, or was he just too anxious to please the Chinese government when he sold those 22 homes? hon. Chair, the homes the member opposite is referring to are in the province of B.C., and I have to commend the province for the early work it did to protect seniors in those long-term care homes. As she knows, the review we did was entirely separate from the standards to which the province holds the care homes. cathy mcleod: The Prime Minister does not have authority over seniors' homes, which he has clearly stated, but he does have authority over the act in which he approved the sale. Chair, the long-term care homes in each province fall within the jurisdiction of their own particular act, and those provinces and territories are responsible for fulfilling the inspections required under that act. cathy mcleod: Under the Investment Canada Act, the government is obligated to review the sale for compliance. Since the government approved the sale, it is complicit in the care of our seniors in this country hon. That is why we follow the appropriate steps, outlined under the Investment Canada Act, to make sure that any measures we take keep seniors and their well-being first and foremost. alain therrien (la prairie, bq): Mr.Chair, during the pandemic, the government has given money to companies that don't pay a cent in tax because they use tax havens. During the pandemic, the government gave money to Air Canada, but Air Canada never reimbursed customers who did not get the services they paid for. Is the moral of the story that the government thinks that dipping into the pockets of taxpayers to spend money carelessly is no big deal? hon. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): Mr.Chair, the fight against tax evasion is a priority for our government. alain therrien: Mr.Chair, when I see that it's the Minister of National Revenue answering me, I don't feel like buying a lottery ticket. The Liberal Party used two airplanes in its last election campaign, which seems to indicate that it isn't short of money. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, we think it's very important to protect employees across the country and in every economic sector that's experiencing a significant drop in income. That's the approach we've taken to protect people and to ensure that there will be jobs in the future. alain therrien: It's especially important to protect the employees who work for the Liberals to ensure their re-election, yet the Liberal Party has raised more than $7million since the last election. We think that this principle is very important and that this approach must be maintained in order to have a better job market in the future. alain therrien: Mr.Chair, we still don't know exactly how much money the Liberals took from the cookie jar. How many SMEs could have been saved with the $1million that the Liberals took out of the jar and took away from SMEs? hon. We are protecting hundreds of thousands of SMEs through the emergency wage subsidy, the Canada emergency response benefit and all our programs. alain therrien: Mr.Chair, I will propose a choice of answers, or I won't get any. The first possible answer is that when the Liberals brought in the emergency wage subsidy, they set parameters allowing them to use it. The second is that when the Liberals saw the Conservative Partywhich is as rich as they are, but also sanctimonious and self-righteoustake advantage of the subsidy, they thought they could do it too. The third possible answer is that the Liberals hadn't planned to use the subsidy, but they pounced on the cookie jar when they saw it, because that's what they do. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, we continue to think it is very important to protect employees in every sector of the economy and across Canada. That's our approach, and I believe it's the right one to protect and preserve jobs across the country during a pandemic. the chair: We are now going to suspend the proceedings for a few seconds to allow the employees who provide support for the meeting to replace each other safely. Chair, when the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces stepped in to provide support to five long-term care homes in Ontario at the request of the premier, they released a report that outlined their findings in detail. Almost 1,000 seniors so far have lost their lives in long-term care homes in Ontario alone, over 25 of them in my riding of MississaugaErin Mills. Can the Minister of Health please update the House on how our federal government is working with the provinces and territories to prevent further tragic occurrences from happening at long-term care homes and to ensure that our most vulnerable seniors are properly looked after and cared for? hon. I believe all Canadians were deeply horrified to read the details from the Canadian Armed Forces on the conditions in long-term care homes in Ontario. I had a very good conversation with my provincial and territorial counterparts last night about the work we can do at a national level to support their important work. We'll continue to work with the provinces and territories to ensure that they get the care and dignity they deserve. I will sadly report that my community of Pickering has experienced the largest number of deaths at a single COVID-19 outbreak location anywhere in this country. Yesterday, we received the horrific report from the Canadian Armed Forces detailing what they witnessed at Orchard Villa in Pickering, Altamont Care Community in Scarborough, Eatonville Care Centre in Etobicoke, Hawthorne Place in North York, and Holland Christian Homes' Grace Manor in Brampton. The loved ones of those who have passed away, as well as the homes' workers, have asked for a full public inquiry from the Ontario government. I know that the responsibility for these facilities falls within provincial jurisdiction, but on behalf of our communities, can the Minister of Health update us on the work she is doing to ensure that the Ontario government takes action immediately and initiates a full, independent, non-partisan public inquiry and reverses its decision to create a government-led commission that won't even start until September? hon. Chair, I would say that all Canadians were shocked and horrified to hear about the conditions that existed in these particular care homes. We're so grateful to the members of the armed forces who not only improved conditions but also reported them quickly and appropriately to ensure amelioration of those conditions for those particular individuals. We also know that there are seniors all across the country who are struggling with care and with the appropriate level of care. I stand committed to working with my provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure that we do better as a society. We know that there's a role we can play at the federal level with advice, with guidance, with support and, yes, with investments. We look forward to having those conversations about how best we can improve the care for all seniors amongst us. Canadians were horrified to hear the report yesterday from our armed forces about the appalling conditions experienced by seniors in our long-term care homes. Page after page detailed the filth, neglect, abuse and danger our seniors in care are exposed to on a daily basis. Shockingly they face injury and death through missed medications, expired medications, unsterile devices and violations of basic contagion rules to stop the spread of COVID-19. Given that evidence of possible criminal conduct was contained in the military's report, will the minister refer this matter to the RCMP for investigation immediately? hon. We understand in long-term care facilities both seniors and persons living with a disability face unique challenges, and the findings of this report are in fact deeply concerning and completely unacceptable. Considering the severity of this report, we promptly shared it with the Province of Ontario, and the Province of Ontario has initiated an investigation based on the report's findings. Their investigation includes alerting the province's chief coroner who has the authority to alert the police of jurisdiction. We will continue to work with the province to protect those living in long-term care facilities, and we continue to support them through the deployment of our outstanding Canadian Armed Forces and in our partnership with the Red Cross. Chair, that's a shocking answer considering there's clear evidence of criminal conduct and negligence in this. That this federal government is not taking immediate steps to refer this to the nation's RCMP is unacceptable. COVID-19 has exposed critical vulnerabilities across Canada's entire network of long-term care facilities. Not a single province or territory currently meets the benchmark of 4.1 hours of hands-on care per day. As a result Canada has the worst record of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care among 14 comparable countries, with over 80% of Canadian fatalities occurring in these facilities. Chair, the member opposite is exactly correct when he says that those who are hardest hit in terms of losing their lives and the negative effects of COVID are those who are living in long-term care homes. He's also correct when he indicates that COVID-19 has shown us what many of us have known for a long time, that we need to do better in long-term care and supports for seniors. As the member knows, we started those steps some four years ago or so when we began to make incredible investments in aging at home. We know that is one part of the solution, but we have to do better for those seniors who need a higher level of care. I'm working with my colleagues at the provinces and territories to make sure that we come up with a solution that will truly result in better standards for all. Chair, what we need is binding national standards, just like we set through the Canada Health Act in the health care sector generally. Gross fecal contamination, filthy medical equipment, insect infestations, ignoring patient cries for hourswe would never tolerate these conditions in Canada's hospitals. Will the minister move to bring long-term care facilities under the Canada Health Act, or similar legislation, with formal funds tied to acceptable standards of care for our seniors, just like we do for hospitals? hon. Chair, the member shares the disgust and concern of so many Canadians across the country, not only those who have read the report but many of those who have struggled to provide care to elders in those long-term care homes, regardless of the province in which they live. We know that collectively, at all levels of government, we must do better for those people who cared for us and nurtured us all of those years. The member has my commitment that I will work with provinces and territories to find a solution forward to ensure that every person has the right to age with dignity and safety. Davies, you have 15 seconds for another question, a short one, and leave time for a response. These failures are the product of systemic neglect often motivated by prioritizing profit over the provision of adequate care. Does the minister agree that we should not be putting profits above the health care needs of Canada's seniors? hon. Chair, I believe that, when we commit to taking care of people, we must do so with the utmost care that is required. We must all work together to protect those people in our lives who are most vulnerable, whether they be seniors, children or others. jamie schmale (haliburtonkawartha lakesbrock, cpc): Thank you, Chair. According to Vaughn Palmer in an editorial in the Vancouver Sun regarding the secret Wet'suwet'en deal, Palmer writes:     The hereditary chiefs calculated the two governments would sign despite the objections from the elected chiefs.   Can the minister describe another situation in which the federal government negotiated a secret deal of this magnitude with unelected people? hon. carolyn bennett (minister of crown-indigenous relations): I thank the member for his ongoing concern and I want to remind him that actually it is in keeping with the Supreme Court decision of 1997 that we were to now begin those conversations with the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who took the case to the Supreme Court. As we've said many times, this is not an agreement; this is an MOU that establishes the path forward for the substantive discussions towards a final agreement, which would describe the future governance and the implementation of Wet'suwet'en rights and title. Chair, if it is a shared commitment, why on the eve of the signing ceremony did the four elected chiefs denounce the hereditary chiefs for keeping them in the dark? hon. carolyn bennett: Again, it's really important that the member understand that there was a process for the hereditary chiefs to go back to their communities and discuss with them. Any agreement after the good work that will happen now would have to go back and seek the approval of all of the communities. Chair, the Burns Lake Band members are openly wondering if they're still a band or if the few unelected hereditary chiefs will control everything now. Minister, can you assure them that going forward you will honour their concerns and take the time to listen? the acting chair (mr. carolyn bennett: Actually, the honourable member knows that the next steps include the further and ongoing engagement by the Wet'suwet'en in their house groups and that will include the six elected chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en nation, their community members and many others. Cynthia Joseph, a chief councillor with the Hagwilget First Nation says the MOU between Ottawa, the province and the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs was only shared with her community members on May 9, two days after it was published in the media. carolyn bennett: Walking the path of reconciliation means that we work with our partners and there is a way that they do the work within their communities. It is going to be an agreement to begin the work, but any final agreement is going to have to be approved by all members of the nation in terms of developing a consensus for the agreement the acting chair (mr. Does the minister have any concerns regarding claims by several former female hereditary chiefs that they were stripped of their hereditary status because they didn't agree with the men? hon. carolyn bennett: Again, it is going to be really important that the work take place within the Wet'suwet'en nation to determine their future governance, to determine their way of working with Canada and to make sure the acting chair (mr. For some reason it seems to be a problem to stand up for these hereditary female chiefs who had their titles taken away. Does the minister plan on recognizing band council resolutions denying the authority of hereditary chiefs to sign any future agreements without consent of the elected chiefs and the 3,000 members within the Wet'suwet'en they represent? hon. carolyn bennett: I think the member must understand that, as we begin the work, the nation will do its work and then we will come to the table to determine what the governance would be. Will it be a hybrid model like at Heiltsuk, like Ktunaxa, like some of the communities developing their constitutions, developing their laws and deciding how they will determine their own governance and that partnership with Canada? the acting chair (mr. pierre paul-hus (charlesbourghaute-saint-charles, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. The current restrictions on non-essential travel at the border do not prevent people from claiming refugee protection if they have family in Canada. We have heard from many constituents and members of Parliament from right across the country who are expressing concern about non-status spouses being denied entry into the country because their travel is deemed to be non-essential. I've recently been in touch with all of the provinces and territories because I think it's very important that we have their support for any changes the acting chair (mr. pierre paul-hus: If I understand correctly, Mr.Minister, you are talking to provincial representatives, but a case like that of ChantalTremblay, for instance, is unacceptable. For two months now, she has been trying to bring her spouse to Canada, but it isn't working. Is there a way to issue a directive to border services officers that married spousesit's often marriages with Americanscan cross the border to join their spouses in Canada? hon. bill blair: Just to be very clearagain, I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to clarify thisit is never our intention to separate families, but at the same time, we have imposed appropriate and necessary restrictions on non-essential travel. Our border services officers inquire of everyone coming to that border about the nature of their travel, and for non-citizens who come to that border seeking entry into Canada, if their entry is deemed non-essential, then they exercise their discretion not to allow the acting chair (mr. However, 100,000foreigners have entered Canada, even though the border is supposedly closed. How does the minister explain the fact that 100,000people arrived in Canada by plane? hon. We have imposed very significant restrictions on non-essential travel, but of course there are circumstances where individuals come to this country and their entry into Canada is deemed essential. For example, someone who is providing medical services and coming into Canada to provide those services would be deemed essential, because there is a great need among Canadians for those services. As you can see by the numbers, we have had a very significant reduction in the travel of all non-Canadians to Canada over the past two months. pierre paul-hus: So the minister confirms that the 100,000people who arrived by air were providing a service considered essential to Canada. I'm not talking about the people who crossed the land border, but the people who came to Canada by air. bill blair: What I can tell you is that at all points of entry, including our air borders, we apply the standard that the travel must be deemed essential, and that determination is utilized to see if a person is eligible to enter into the country. pierre paul-hus: We're now learning that the Correctional Service of Canada's investigation into the murder of MarylneLevesque is suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Can the minister direct the Correctional Service of Canada to resume the investigation into the death of MarylneLevesque? hon. bill blair: Again, I thank the member for the question, because we know the concern of the people of Quebec, and the family of Ms. That's why we asked the Parole Board and the Correctional Service of Canada to convene a board of investigation. Clearly, during COVID transmission, the ability to conduct that investigation and to interview all of the witnesses became extremely difficult and has been temporarily suspended, but at the very earliest opportunity we remain resolute to resume that investigation and get to the bottom of it to provide the answers that the family deserves. pierre paul-hus: Mr.Chair, victims of crime are one of the segments of the population most affected by the crisis. For the first time in its history, and to add insult to injury, the government has cancelled all activities related to Victims and Survivors of Crime Week, which was to take place next week. bill blair: Again, at the earliest days of COVID, until arrangements could be put in place, there were restrictions on victims participating. We have put the systems in place to allow victims to present their evidence virtually, either by video or by phone, to ensure that their voices are heard in these important things. We very much respect and support the role of victims in these determinations, and we're making every effort to ensure that they can participate. Chair, yesterday I asked the Minister of Small Business how many business credit availability guarantees were issued by EDC, and I didn't get a number. Money from this program is flowing, and businesses across the country are receiving the important support that they need. Chair, these are large loans, and they require important due diligence and adjudication by the financial institutions. mary ng: I want to assure the member that we're going to do everything possible to support businesses and workers during this very important time. james cumming: How many businesses have received funding under the BCAP co-lending program since March? hon. mary ng: The lending programs, particularly the program to help small businesses, have really helped lots of businesses. Over 630,000 loans have been issued, and this is really helping those the acting chair (mr. james cumming: Unfortunately, lots is not an answer for the businesses that I'm trying to talk to. Can you tell me, for the CEBA changes that were recently announced, when will we be able to see people who have income through a dividend able to apply? hon. Those small businesses that will meet the expanded CEBA criteria are working very diligently with the financial institutions to make sure that they can get access to those loans as quickly as possible. mary ng: The financial institutions are working very hard to make sure that they can make this available to businesses. mary ng: We will work very hard and very diligently to make sure that these businesses and those sole proprietors are supported. mary ng: There is nothing more important than making sure these businesses weather the difficult time of COVID-19, and our measures are the acting chair (mr. mary ng: Today, over 630,000 businesses have received the support to do things like pay for salaries, the 25% top-up for the wage subsidy, pay for rent and pay for insurance and utilities. james cumming: How many dollars are left in the program so businesses can have some certainty that the program will be available for some time? hon. mary ng: I think you will see that the businesses across the country that I have talked to really appreciate that the government has stepped up to help them during this difficult time. These include women with businesses, indigenous-owned businesses and those small businesses all across our communities, all across the country, that are getting the necessary help. mary ng: There are 630,000 businesses that are getting help, and thousands more businesses will be getting help with the expanded criteria. We're going to keep doing the work that we need to help our businesses across this country through this difficult time. james cumming: I heard from a constituent in my riding that they waited for over four hours on the portal for CECRA. james cumming: Finally, the Prime Minister yesterday said that a list of all organizations that have been receiving CEWS will be made public. mary ng: We have committed to making sure that those companies taking the wage subsidy program will be listed publicly. The Canadian Coast Guard is doing a search at this moment following the loss of a vessel off the coast of Newfoundland. From my community, which is a seafaring, fishing community, I just want to put my thoughts out there to the folks of Newfoundland. bernadette jordan (minister of fisheries, oceans and the canadian coast guard): Thank you, Mr. I want to thank my colleague for his comments with regard to the tragic accident off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, where we saw the loss of life in a fishing accident. We have made available over half a billion dollars to processors and harvesters to make sure they can weather this storm. We have made sure that the harvesters are able to access the harvester benefit as well as the grant, recognizing the unique nature of their business and how they are not able to access some of our other programs. Chair, to continue along this vein for a moment, we are still looking at unstable markets for a longer period of time. The plants are filling up, and harvesters are worried that they might stop buying product before the season is complete. What can the fishermen expect, or what kinds of programs can they expect, if the season goes bust? hon. We also know that because of the decline in markets, we've had to make accommodations for the processing sector in order to help them be better able to support the harvesters. We have put in $62.5 million, which is allowing the processors to increase capacity in their refrigeration and freezers so that they will continue to be able to purchase product. As I said earlier, we will continue to monitor the situation and make sure we do everything possible to support our harvesters. Chair, I don't know whether this next question will go to the Minister of DFO or the Minister of Transport. For those who are far-sighted or nearsighted, you just have to put on your glasses to correct it. I don't know about space shuttles, but who knows? You can now wear colour-corrected lenses, but Transport Canada still does not recognize these for use. We have medical standards with respect to a number of different kinds of transportation-related jobs for pilots, mariners and those kinds of occupations, which have to be respected. chris d'entremont: Mr.Chair, the eligibility criteria for financial support include the need to demonstrate a significant loss of income during the months of March and April, yet several SMEs in the tourism industry can't qualify because their operations start with the tourist season, in late May or early June. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, before accessing the emergency wage subsidy, applicants must meet important criteria. However, as we explained last week, we will be adjusting the wage subsidy until the end of August, and we will be reviewing the criteria. bruce stanton): We're going to go to the west coast and the member for SaanichGulf Islands. My colleague, Jenica Atwin from Fredericton, held a press conference this morning in which she used the term echo pandemic. My question to the minister is this: Will we see direct funding to community mental health services as urgently requested by the Canadian Mental Health Association? hon. Chair, I read the honourable member's colleague's letter just today, and I want to reassure all members that we have invested in mental health supports for Canadians, obviously before the pandemic hit but certainly since we've been living with the pandemic. I'd like to remind all members to direct their constituents to the wellnesstogether.ca website and portal. There Canadians can find online resources, as well as connections to real and alive counsellors and other professionals who can help them with their various concerns. That's not just unprecedented over thousands of years; that's unprecedented over the last one million years. The recognized parties in the House have established standing committees to work, but not the committee on the environment. When will the recognized parties remember the June 2019 emergency resolution that we are in a climate emergency, and start making sure that we hit 2020 commitments under the Paris Agreement to improve our targets? hon. We realize that along with the COVID pandemic, which is the major problem that exists in the world today, there is another problem as well that affects the entire planet, and that is the problem associated with climate change. elizabeth may: My next question will be for Minister Blair, but as an aside, I will say that last answer completely fails to meet the legal requirements of the Paris Agreement to file a new target this year. To save some time, Minister Blair, let's pretend to go back to the questions from my colleague MP Paul-Hus and to your last answer. Could the minister please put out a directive, advice to every CBSA agent on the ground, that when a non-status entry point sees a non-status direct relativehusband, wife, child of a Canadian citizenthat relative be deemed to be entering Canada for an essential purpose? hon. At the same time, we've been working with the provinces and territories, listening to the concerns of Canadians about ensuring that travel across our international border, particularly with the United States, is limited to essential travel. As I've indicated, I've had a number of important conversations and necessary conversations with our provincial and territorial partners. I believe there is a consensus on the right way forward on this, and we're working very diligently to put it in place. I believe our border services officers have been doing an extraordinary job for us in the exercise of their discretion. At the same time, they have been doing the important work of ensuring the health and safety of Canadians at our border. jenny kwan (vancouver east, ndp): Four out of the five homes listed in the armed forces report were for-profit. Will the minister admit that the for-profit model is failing our loved ones and commit to getting profits out of long-term care? hon. patty hajdu: As the member opposite notes, nobody can read that report or hear those stories without feeling absolute horror and disgust and without demanding better for the elders in our lives. As I have mentioned many times in the House, our government remains committed to working with provinces and territories to ensure that every elder person in our community can age with dignity and in safety. Will the minister make sure that the focus of long-term care homes is taking care of seniors and not taking care of owners' bank accounts? hon. patty hajdu: As the member will obviously know, long-term care remains in the jurisdiction of provinces and territories, and there is legislation that rules them as such. As the member also knows, we have stood by Ontario and all of the other provinces and territories throughout this outbreak. jenny kwan: Is the minister refusing to answer the question because she agrees that profit should come before care? hon. patty hajdu: I think it's unfortunate that the member is trying to place words in my mouth. What I do agree with, though, is that long-term care needs to be reformed, and I think all provinces and territories know, and all Canadians know, that we have to do a better job. Is she willing to defend for-profit care for our seniors? Is she in favour of for-profit private health care too? hon. patty hajdu: What I am willing to defend is the right for all Canadians to age with safety and dignity. jenny kwan: To the minister, what is the difference? Why sell out the care of our seniors? Will she commit that she will take profit out of long-term care? hon. Chair, I think the member opposite knows that the only way to actually reform long-term care is to work with provinces and territories, in fact, all levels of government, to ensure that the people who spent their lives caring for and nurturing us can end their lives with caring and nurturing the acting chair (mr. Since the government owns these homes, has the military been sent in there to see what's happening to seniors under their care? hon. Chair, we know that it is important to work with all of the provinces and territories under whose jurisdiction it falls to protect the seniors within those care homes. That's what we've been doing since the beginning of the outbreak of the coronavirus, and that's what we'll continue to do to protect the lives of seniors and strengthen their protection. Chair, work with the provinces and territories to have a longer-term plan so that all seniors can age with dignity and safety. What is the government doing to ensure the standards of care in these Revera homes that they own? hon. Chair, as I have repeatedly said, the jurisdiction for care of long-term care homes falls within the provincial and territorial realm. Chair, we have been there for provinces and territories since the outbreak of the coronavirus, and as the member opposite has clearly or likely heard the Prime Minister say, we will stand with provinces and territories as all elders have the right to age with dignity the acting chair (mr. Do you think that the families of the seniors in these homes want to hear those excuses about jurisdictional issues? Does the minister not think that the families want to hear that the federal government is doing all it can to care for their parents? the acting chair (mr. Quite frankly, I don't think that families care which level of government is responsible for caring for their elders. That's in fact what our government believes, and that's why we have willingly stepped up to say to provinces and territories that we will be there with you to make sure that all seniors in our lives have the right to age with dignity and care. bruce stanton): We will now give the floor to Mrs.Gill, from the riding of Manicouagan. marilne gill (manicouagan, bq): Mr.Chair, my question is for the Prime Minister who, earlier, clearly told us that the government's assistance is intended for those who are most in need and most vulnerable. I don't know if the PrimeMinister read the newspapers yesterday, but in Quebec, losses to the tune of $4billion are expected until March2021 in the tourism accommodation sector alone. How can I justify to my constituents the fact that a political party, which does not need it, has already seen money from the emergency wage subsidy, when people in my riding don't yet have access to it because of the seasonal nature of their work? These people haven't seen the money that is available through these programs. bill morneau: We think it is very important to protect the country's employees in all sectors of the economy. Through this approach, there will be more jobs after the pandemic, and the economic situation will be better. They are saying that they are protecting the jobs of the Liberal Party of Canada, which does not need the money. Another program was created for them, which isn't quite the same and doesn't really meet their needs. A government whose political wingnot the parliamentary wingdoesn't really need money takes money from the fund, but leaves fishers to make do with less generous programs that don't meet their needs. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, we know that many sectors of the economy across the country are facing challenges. We will continue our approach because we believe it's the best way to protect employees and our economy. The government is saying that the best way to proceed is to give money to the political wing of the Liberal Party of Canada, when there are people who are getting nothing. What am I supposed to tell seasonal workers, who have absolutely no assurances for their future? I can't go back to my riding and say I'm proud of the work the government is doing or our efforts in the House. I have a very hard time accepting that the government is helping employees of the Liberal Party in preparation for the next election campaign, when communities in my region are dying because their economies revolve around a single industry. I can't tell them I'm not ashamed of what's going on as we speak. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy. marilne gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries? hon. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic. bruce stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage. anita anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward. tamara jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians? hon. anita anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place the acting chair (mr. tamara jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled? hon. anita anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. tamara jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system. tamara jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. anita anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. bruce stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference<doc-sep>anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 14thmeeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up on either side of the Speaker's chair, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor audio or to interpretation using their earpiece at their desk. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name, and please direct your remarks through the chair. For those joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by video conference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their mic and state that they have a point of order. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Chair, I have the honour to table, in both official languages, a report entitled \"Democracy Matters, Debates Count: A report on the 2019 Leaders' Debates Commission and the future of debates in Canada. Chair, on behalf of all of us, I want to thank the Right Honourable David Johnston for his continued service. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that you please come to the front and drop off your certificate at the table once the petition has been presented. It would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent by the donor. It also creates a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill is designed to confront and address the horrific practice by which, in certain casesfor instance, inside Chinaminority communities or dissidents may be targeted and have their organs removed as they're killed and used for transplantation. Petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204, and they want to see it passed as soon as possible. Chair, I am presenting a petition today signed by Canadians who are concerned that Bill C-7 removes safeguards from the current euthanasia regime, including the mandatory 10-day waiting period. Chair, these people who are signing this petition would like to see an improvement in assisted living, not assisted dying. It asks that the Government of Canada recognize the Republic of Somaliland as an autonomous state that may result in foreign investments, direct access of development aid, foreign aid for disaster relief and infrastructure development investment loans. fayal el-khoury (lavalles les, lib.): Mr.Chair, I thank the government for the way it has managed this global crisis and its impact on Canadians. Canada is one of the few countries that has acted in the best interests of its citizens and maintained their dignity in these uncertain times. While addressing Canadians, our right honourable Prime Minister showed us leadership, the importance of transparency, and integrity. His top priority was saving lives, along with finding realistic solutions regarding the economic impact on our daily life. Because of his outstanding leadership, we're admired across the world, which is another distinguished privilege of being Canadian. dave epp (chatham-kentleamington, cpc): COVID-19 has emptied food banks across Canada, even in an agricultural community like Chatham-Kent, so Wes Thompson and James Rasmussen, along with Alysson Storey, Randi Bokor, Maureen Geddes, Chris and Terry Johnston, Jason King, Fannie Vavoulis and Brent Wilken, grew an idea into the community's largest-ever food drive. Project manager Morna McDonald estimates that over 3,000 volunteers ended up helping in the May 16 Miracle. Residents put non-perishable foodstuffs on their doorsteps, with drop-off centres organized for rural areas. They accidentally exceeded by over 20% the record in the Guinness World Records book for collected food in a single day. chris d'entremont (west nova, cpc): As much as I like seeing my friends on the big screens, there are no big screens yet, so we don't know who's on and who's not on. Here in Surrey Centre, and across Canada, the Filipino community makes important contributions to our cities and has helped shape Canada into the vibrant multicultural society that we all know and love today. Now more than ever, during these challenging times we must come together as Canadians to celebrate the rich heritage and history of our Filipino neighbours. Throughout June, please join me in celebrating our fellow citizens of Filipino descent by recognizing all the incredible ways in which they have contributed to making Canada a better place for all of us. yves perron (berthiermaskinong, bq): Good afternoon, Mr.Chair. Today is World Milk Day, and I would like to recognize the exceptional work and dedication shown by everyone in the industry. Let's take part in the local consumption movement and rediscover the exceptional products of our dairy producers and processors. Enjoy the yogurts, cheeses and other products because it's true that milk is good. I would also like to thank BrunoLetendre, outgoing chair of the Producteurs de lait du Qubec, and I congratulate the new chair, DanielGobeil. The first step must be the direct allocation of import quotas to processors, and the second must be the full payment of the promised compensation. angelo iacono (alfred-pellan, lib.): Mr.Chair, June is Italian Heritage Month. The situation is special this year, since Italy has been hard hit by COVID-19, with more than 30,000deaths. Like me, many Italian Canadians still have family and friends in Italy, and the news has sometimes been very difficult to take, yet that has not detracted from the great co-operation that exists between Canada and Italy. During the pandemic, Canadians of Italian descent have been united to support anziani, our famiglie and our amici in Italy by participating in the fundraising campaign COVID-19 AiutiAMO lItalia to support the Italian Red Cross response activities. I send a special salute to to my cugino Giuseppe, who is still on the road to recovery from COVID-19. Chair, I would like to acknowledge all of the organizations in Saskatchewan and across Canada that are working hard to help small businesses adapt to the challenges of the current pandemic. As soon as the pandemic hit, RDBID launched a daily electronic newsletter to keep their members informed of support programs, local initiatives and local success stories. They have used their social media channels on a daily basis to promote takeout and delivery services, online and curbside services offered by restaurants and retailers. Through persistent communication and a lot of long hours, RDBID has helped businesses in downtown Regina to weather the storm. stphane lauzon (argenteuilla petite-nation, lib.): Mr.Chair, high-speed Internet will be to the 21stcentury what electricity was to the 20th: an essential service. I would like to reassure the citizens of my riding about the efforts that we are making as a government, but also about the work I've been doing as a member of Parliament since2015 to connect the 41municipalities of ArgenteuilLa Petite-Nation. Aside from this essential service, our students, seniors, entrepreneurs and telework are very important to the regions. We have heard you, and I will continue to fight for you, so that you can have access to affordable high-speed Internet. Chair, a few days ago, we all watched with horror and outrage the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of the police in Minneapolis. For many of us, these images may seem shocking, but it's an all too familiar tale to millions of black people not only in the United States but also here in Canada, in my city of Gatineau and around the world, who must at times live with the scourge of anti-black racism.  Mr.Chair, I can't know what it's like to be black in our society. What I do know, however, is that you and I, and everyone in this House, have the power and the responsibility to make our country more just. Black Canadians and all those who have to endure racism and discrimination are watching us, and they expect more from us. eric duncan (stormontdundassouth glengarry, cpc): Without a doubt, these past few months have been challenging, to say the least, from both a health and economic perspective, but, Mr. Chair, I have to say how proud I am of my community of StormontDundasSouth Glengarry. We continue to successfully flatten the curve in our region and, just as importantly, we are making sure that we are here for each other, whether it is the Cornwall Optimists' GoFeedMe campaign, the Iroquois-Matilda Lions Club delivering groceries to those who are quarantined in their households or the local United Way, the Social Development Council or the Carefor seniors support centre co-leading an effort to deliver 1,500 baskets to seniors in need. I rise today in the House of Commons to say thank you to my constituents and to all Canadians; to our essential front-line workers, our service clubs and our businesses that have stepped up to help out; and to everybody playing their part to get us through this challenge. I couldn't be more proud of my community and my residents, and it is an honour to serve as their member of Parliament. Chair, although Asian Heritage Month has just passed, we recognize the tremendous effort of all Asian Canadians on the front lines of this pandemic, as health care providers or as essential workers. I want to thank the many Asian organizations for donating to ScarboroughAgincourt's hospital, long-term care homes and food banks. As a Canadian born and raised in Scarborough, I'm offended by the reports of violence and vandalism targeting Asian-Canadian communities across this country. In budget 2019 we invested $45 million to launch a new anti-racism strategy, which included the establishment of the anti-racism secretariat, because these efforts are unfortunately clearly still needed. As events continue to unfold in the United States, it is important to recognize that we have work to do here as well. Whether it is anti-black or anti-Asian, racism and discrimination of any kind have no place in Canadafull stop. richard bragdon (tobiquemactaquac, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Over the last few months, Canadians throughout New Brunswick and across the country have stepped up to support their community. Health care workers, truckers, farmers, business owners, pharmacists, grocery store staff, faith-based and non-profit organizations and so many others have all answered the call to do their part. Chair, I would like to specifically highlight the work of those who support and take care of our seniors, who are among some of our most at-risk citizens. It has been said that the character of a nation and its people is revealed most in how they treat their most vulnerable. Whether they be long-term care staff, personal care workers, health care professionals, family members or volunteers, thank you for all you are doing in support of our seniors. Although we've come to the end of Asian Heritage Month, I'd like to acknowledge some unsung Chinese Canadian heroes who shed their blood as patriots for our nation. I commemorate the 6,500 Chinese Canadians of the 9,000 railway workers who helped build and unite Canada. I pay respect to the many Chinese Canadians who died while building the CP Railway on the most dangerous terrains in the B.C. Adult children should not have to call their elderly parents to tell them to stay home because they might be attacked by racists. There's no justification for racial slurs, physical violence or vandalism against any individual or community. I will continue to work together with other elected officials, the police and the RCMP to mitigate these issues toward justice and restoration. charlie angus (timminsjames bay, ndp): Ten years ago today, Cree youth leader Shannen Koostachin was killed in a horrific car accident. She was only 15 years old, yet in her short life she became the voice of a generation of first nation youth who were no longer willing to put up with systemic discrimination. Shannen never lived to see the school that was built in her community, but her work carries on through the Shannen's Dream movement. xavier barsalou-duval (pierre-boucherles patriotesverchres, bq): Mr.Chair, for months now, thousands of consumers who need money to pay their bills have been fighting against airlines and the government to have their rights respected: three class action suits, a unanimous motion by the National Assembly and over 30,000signatures on a petition calling for reimbursement for cancelled flights. Air Canada, which confiscated $2.6billion from its customers, received more than $800million from Ottawa without any conditions. Yet, the company has a year's worth of cash in reserve, $6billion in its coffers, and is in the process of raising more than $1.4billion in the financial markets. alain rayes (richmondarthabaska, cpc): Mr.Chair, I want to pay tribute to a great man who represented the public here, in the House, for close to 15years: MichelGauthier. Michel, in life, we meet a lot of people, but some of them leave their mark on us forever. From the first time I spoke with you two years ago, I immediately understood that I was talking with a man with heart, a passionate man, a man who had Quebec imprinted on his heart. Because of your decision to join the Conservative Party of Canada, I got to know you personally, and I am most grateful. I will remember all the passion and energy you had in the lead-up to a speech to our supporters. Michel, Canadians, Quebeckers and I will remember you forever, the great man you were, the outstanding speaker, a formidable parliamentarian, with integrity, passion, commitment and love for Quebec. emmanuel dubourg (bourassa, lib.): Mr.Chair, the murder of GeorgeFloyd in Minneapolis resonated strongly within black communities in Canada and also in the heart of Montreal North. At a time of pandemic uncertainty when members of our community find themselves on the front lines as essential workers, an event like this rekindles feelings of fear, powerlessness and injustice. It has happened once again in the UnitedStates, but we are not immune to such behaviour here, in Canada. Dear constituents of Bourassa, I know our stories, I feel with you the pain as a parent and as a black person.  There seems to be some interference when you watch the video conference in the chamber and it's being transmitted, so let us make things run more smoothly. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes in order to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. When the government first starting rolling out programs to help Canadians get through this pandemic, we raised points about some flaws and gaps in the program. Well, Canadians are suffering through both the health and the economic consequences of the lockdown related to the coronavirus. Here we are the first day of June and the government still has yet to address the flaws in its programs; it is still letting so many Canadians down. On April 20 we raised with the Minister of Finance the issue of companies that had purchased another company not being able to demonstrate revenue loss, and therefore not being eligible for the wage subsidy, even though both companies separately would have been able to do just that. I would like to ask the government when it will be fixing this unnecessarily rigid aspect of the wage subsidy program. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr. Chair, I believe that a company with a fantastic Canadian history in the member's riding, Brandt Tractor, which pioneered the manufacturing of augers in Canada, is particularly affected by this. I know that in the case of Brandt Tractor, for example, officials from the Ministry of Finance are directly in touch with the company to work on its issues. It's the same answer we got two weeks before that, and it's the same answer we have been getting from day one. This is a very specific question: Will the government fix this program and allow for companies that have acquired another company to still access the wage subsidy program? hon. Chair, let me just point out that the wage subsidy program is working extremely well for many, many Canadian companies and for many, many Canadians who are able to keep their jobs thanks to the program. Now, for sure there are always going to be companies which, because of specifics in their history, need specific attention, and that the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, reports indicate that up to half of the money allocated for the wage subsidy is going unspent, precisely because this government has left in unnecessarily rigid barriers for companies to be able to access it. It's a yes-or-no question, and the minister still can't answer it. Along the same lines, we asked on April 8 to allow businesses applying for the wage subsidy to demonstrate their 30% revenue loss using other metrics, such as loss of earnings, subscriptions and orders, in order to qualify. Chair, we are very proud of the wage subsidy program and proud of the role it is playing to keep Canadian businesses going and, crucially, to keep Canadian workers connected to their jobs, but I have a question for the member opposite. Half of the questions we hear from the Conservatives in question period are concerns that we're spending too much money, that the deficit is too high. We believe that when times were good, this government should have paid down debt instead of wasting money like $50 million to Mastercard and $12 million to Loblaws. The fact of the matter is that the government left Canadians in a vulnerable position as we were entering this pandemic precisely because of its fiscal irresponsibility, and now they have designed programs that have unnecessary barriers in them that prevent more and more Canadians from getting the help they need. Again, on April 26, Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that don't happen to have a business bank account can qualify. Chair, I'm really grateful for that question because it allows me to set the record straight for Canadians. Canadians need to know that our country has the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. Canada has the fiscal firepower to support Canadians during this unprecedented crisis, and that is what we are going to continue to do. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, the wage subsidy was put in place to support businesses and SMEs, to avoid closures and bankruptcy. Have I missed something? Is the Liberal Party on the verge of bankruptcy? Is it about to shut down? Does the Prime Minister consider that the Liberal Party is getting ready to close its doors? hon. More than 2million Canadians have benefited from this the chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille, you have the floor. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, the Liberal Party made $3million between January and March of this year. I'm wondering why the Liberal Party doesn't use its own money to pay its own employees instead of using the Canada emergency wage subsidy. I would like to point out again that the purpose of the Canada emergency wage subsidy is to support workers across Canada and Quebec, to help them keep their jobs and allow them to stay connected to their workplace. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, does the Deputy Prime Minister think it is moral, fair and honest that employees who have lost their jobs are subsidizing an emergency wage subsidy for the Liberal Party of Canada out of their taxes? hon. There is still a lot to do, but we want to work with all the the chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, many struggling businesses in Quebec don't have access to the Canada emergency wage subsidy because they don't meet the eligibility criteria. Does the Deputy Prime Minister really think it's moral for her party to benefit from the emergency wage subsidy when it has the financial means to pay its own employees? hon. However, it's important to point out that our government has already done a lot to support Canadians. More than eightmillion people are benefiting from the CERB, and more than twomillion the chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille, you have the floor. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, what I understand is not really complicated to understand. I understand that the Liberal Party has money, that it has money to pay its employees, but that it doesn't want to cut the booty it has amassed for the next election. It's as if it were telling us that it's indirectly financing itself for the next election. Will the Deputy Prime Minister show some leadership and convince her own party to give up the emergency wage subsidy and even commit to paying back the money it has already received? hon. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I want to point out that our programs do not discriminate. They are there to help all workers across the country, and I want to point out to what extent our programs do that. Eight million people are currently benefiting from the CERB, and two million are supported by the emergency wage subsidy. Our programs are also helping 380,000students and 639,000businesses the chair: We'll now continue with Mr. Canadians and people across the world are reeling after seeing the images of George Floyd being brutally killed in a callous and casual manner. Anti-black racism also impacts Canada, and people here are feeling the frustration of black lives being neglected and ignored. Will the government commit to tracking race-based data in terms of COVID-19's impact on communities, particularly black Canadians, and track race-based data so that we can have a better response based on the evidence? hon. Chair, I would like to start by thanking the member opposite for his very important question and the very important work he has done throughout his career in drawing attention to racism in Canada and in fighting against it. I agree strongly with the member opposite that we, as Canadians, must be the opposite of complacent. We have to acknowledge that anti-black racism is real in our country, that unconscious bias is real in our country and that systemic discrimination is real. I have more to say about disaggregated data and the coronavirus, and I hope I'll have a chance to do that in my next answer. Will the government commit to working with provinces to ensure there are no such practices allowed to exist in Canada, particularly related to discriminatory police practices like carding? Will the federal government work and use its powers to end those discriminatory practices where federal regulation applies, and work with the provinces to ensure this happens across the country? hon. First of all, on coronavirus, our government believes that disaggregated data, including when it comes to race, is extremely important. We will always work to uphold the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and to ensure the human rights of everyone in Canada are protected. At the federal level, RCMP members are guided by bias-free policing based on equality and non-discrimination. How many times did the Prime Minister's Office and the Liberal government meet with lobbyists from for-profit long-term care homes from March 25 to April 22, during the worst impacts of COVID-19 in long-term care homes? hon. Chair, at this moment I can only speak for myself, and I have not met with any such lobbyists during that period or at other times. While seniors were dying in long-term care homes, the Prime Minister's Office and the Liberal government met with private, for-profit long-term care home lobbyists 12 times. Why did the Prime Minister's Office and the Liberal government choose to meet with these for-profit long-term care home lobbyists instead of meeting with those to solve the problem? Instead of making excuses about the federal government not playing a role, why didn't the Prime Minister and the Liberal government show leadership in calling for an end to profit in long-term care homes? hon. chrystia freeland: Let me very clear about one thing, speaking on behalf of our government and on behalf of the Prime Minister. Our government sees as a matter of utmost concern and utmost urgency what has been happening in long-term care homes in our country, and the reports we have received from the brave men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces about facilities in Ontario and Quebec need to be treated as historic documents that the chair: Now it's Mr.Rayes's turn. alain rayes: Mr.Chair, why is it that employers from industry, businesses and community organizations that have been approved in the Canada summer jobs program still haven't received the money they're entitled to? hon. ahmed hussen (minister of families, children and social development): We are ensuring that the Canada summer jobs program is strengthened and enforced. We have lengthened the time period that the program the chair: Mr.Rayes has the floor. Given the importance of the program for our youth who are looking to work, how is it that the organizations haven't yet received the money they need to hire students? As we know, there have been some problems with the CESB. ahmed hussen: Our government is working hard to help employers adapt to the realities of COVID-19. We recognize the important role that the Canada summer jobs program plays in supporting employers and young workers in communities across the country every year. That is why we have introduced flexibilities in the Canada summer jobs program to hire youth while providing more supports to employers. Last year, there was no crisis and, as of April, all employers who had been admitted to the program had received the money. Right now, community organizations are not receiving the money to which they are entitled to hire students, to put them to work and to give them an employment opportunity. Chair, we have managed to introduce flexibilities to take into consideration the difficult environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the flexibilities we've introduced into the Canada summer jobs program will help with more hiring of youth and more supports to employers, including non-profits and businesses that deliver essential services to Canadians. These changes will help small businesses hire and keep the workers that they need in the Canada summer jobs program. alain rayes: The young people and employers listening to us must be very surprised by what the minister is saying. Right now, there is a $240,000shortfall for about 60student jobs, and the minister has the nerve to tell us that the government has provided more flexibility. Why is the money not available if the government wants to act quickly, to help the economy recover and to help young people? hon. We are listening to the needs of the employers to make sure that this program works not only for them but also for youth, and that it gives them the experiences they need. It is adapted better for the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that youth have the experience they need to gain life and work skills from the program. It's a great program, and we're making it work not just for businesses but also for non-profits. Last week, the owner of a hardware store in a village in my riding had to close his business because he was unable to hire students and had no one to work. This morning, an employer called me to tell me that his request to hire a student had been accepted, but that the delay meant that he could not proceed with the hiring. When is the government going to release the money required for young people to be able to work? hon. Chair, I join the honourable member in recognizing that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic there are some difficulties in terms of structuring the program and making sure that employers are able to access it. That is why we've introduced flexibilities to ensure that employers are able to access the program and that youth are also able to take advantage of the program to gain important work skills, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and especially in providing essential services that serve their fellow Canadians. By its own numbers, PSPC has had to cut the number of N95 masks the government has on order after cancelling contracts with companies that were not able to meet Canadian standards. Will the minister commit to making domestic production of PPE, including N95 masks, a priority? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, our priority is to make sure that we get safe and effective equipment and supplies into the hands of front-line health care workers. We have a contract with Medicom in Montreal for the production of N95 masks and we will continue to work hard to ensure the chair: We'll go back to Ms. Chair, Novo Textiles, a company in my riding, has retooled its factory to produce surgical masks in response to the shortage of PPE in Canada. Additionally, it will soon be producing quality made-in-Canada N95 masks using Canadian designs and Canadian-made machinery. My constituent has invested his own capital and is in active production supplying front-line workers right now, not just talking about it. Is the government serious about growing domestic production capacity, or is it all talk and no action? hon. anita anand: In reality, we have received 101.3 million surgical masks that are being distributed out to provinces and territories. Chair, to make sure Canadian front-line health care workers have exactly what they need to fight this pandemic. Chair, I'm not quite sure what the member is referring to by how many of these, but as I said, we have signed 24 contracts with domestic the chair: We'll have to go back to Ms. Chair, we have surgical masks being produced right here at home, as well as abroad, being brought into Canada the chair: Back to Ms. Chair, as I said, we have a contract with General Motors for the production of surgical masks the chair: Ms. It's been over a month, the I Want To Help platform has no details yet about eligibility, levels of funding, or how to apply. When can students expect to start applying for the CSSG so they can receive their grants? Thank you. Chair, I'm pleased to share that students can anticipate more programs coming out as soon as possible. By visiting Canada.ca/coronavirus, you'll see a suite of programs to ensure that students and young people are able to succeed. The coronavirus will not win, and our government will continue investing in our leaders of today and tomorrow. Last week the President of the Treasury Board wrote a letter to his cabinet colleagues in which he said that, as the federal minister responsible for public access to government information, he has advised his cabinet colleagues of the need for transparency and accountability, even in times of crisis. Does she agree with the President of the Treasury Board's directive? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, the government remains committed to maintaining the openness and transparency of our government during this challenging time. The Government of Canada, along with provincial and territorial governments, have implemented exceptional workplace measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, and to protect the health and safety of federal employees. These measures have had an impact on institutions' abilities to respond to access to information and personal information requests, since most employees are now working from their homes. john brassard: Frankly, I'm surprised that the answer is coming from that minister when the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities is in the House, but I will ask this question. steven guilbeault: Treasury Board Secretariat has provided guidance to institutions to continue to make the best efforts to respond to Access to Information Act and Privacy Act requests and to provide published content the chair: We'll go back to Mr. john brassard: Can the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities tell us who Pierre Lavalle is? the chair: The honourable minister. He was the CEO of the Canada Infrastructure Bank since the beginning, but let's be clear: Crown corporations work at arm's length from the government and must have the chair: We'll return to Mr. john brassard: Can I ask the minister how well she knows her file: 50%, 75% or 100%? hon. What I know is that Canadians want infrastructure built, they want it built across the country, in the member opposite's riding and in ridings across the country. john brassard: How much of the $35 billion of infrastructure money that was allocated to that bank has been spent so far? hon. Duclos' advice to his cabinet colleagues about openness and transparency, I'd like to ask the minister how much Mr. Our government follows the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act when it comes to employee compensation, but remuneration ranges are publicly available. I'd note that this information for the bank's CEOs has been in the public domain the chair: Mr. As I say, the information about salary ranges is publicly available, but personal HR the chair: Mr. Lavalle could have received a bonus after year one of zero to 75% of his base salary, which was $510,000 to $600,000 per year; or in year two, which he was in, zero to 120% of his base salary. catherine mckenna: The rate of any remuneration paid to the chief executive officer is based on the recommendations of the board. Will the government commit to reopening the House of Commons with its full powers, with social distancing, on Monday, September 21? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, as my colleague knows, we're meeting here four days a week, with questions on any topic for an hour and 35 minutes instead of 45 minutes a day. It has no powers to introduce supply day motions, no powers to test government confidence, no powers to do the usual things that Parliament does. At times of crisis, the bedrock principles of rule of law and democracy are tested, and our democratic principles are buckling under the pressure from this government. 6, and in the last election, they rigged the leaders' debates in their favour, and now they have suspended Parliament. Instead of this neutered committee that meets for only a few days with a few members, will the government commit to the full re-opening of this House with all its powers with social distancing on Monday, September 21? hon. pablo rodriguez: Mr.Chair, the government's objective is always to try to resume Parliament as it was before. Today, we have to live with this pandemic, but we will do everything we can to return to a normal situation as quickly as possible. Over the past few weeks, we have sent suggestions to opposition members about the operation of Parliament and they have never responded. Chair, the full parliament with its full powers sat through two world wars, previous pandemics and the October crisis in 1970. It is failing to be strong and clear on Hong Kong and, while the situation today is not that of decades past, it is clear that Canada in the past stood for the rights of people in Hong Kong. There are some 300,000 Canadians living there, and they are looking for the government's support. government has? When will it speak up against the Communist Party of China's United Front workers operating here in this country? When will it do like Australia did in calling for an international investigation of COVID-19, and organize an international coalition of like-minded democracies to defend Hong Kongers and the violation of the Sino-British treaty? the chair: The honourable minister. We all know that the one country, two systemsthe high degree of liberty and freedom enjoyed by the people in Hong Konghas made Hong Kong what it is today, a beacon when it comes to trade and financing. Again, on May 28, with the United States, with the United Kingdom and with Australia, Canada was front and centre in saying that we have deep concerns that the imposition of a national security law by Beijing would undermine the very foundation, the very principles that have made Hong Kong so successful. We said that we and our international partners would look at the implications and the ramifications that this might have on our arrangement. We will be discussing it and will continue to raise our voices to stand up for the people of Hong Kong, and we will do it with our allies. What's the point of having an advance payment program if there's no payment? Can the Minister of Agriculture tell us when these delays will end? the chair: The honourable minister. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): Mr.Chair, I can assure you that we are working with all the independent operators. I can assure you that, under the circumstances, they are doing their best to make the advance payments mr. However, did the minister approve a policy change on April 1 that made the eligibility for these loans more difficult during the middle of a pandemic, yes or no? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, a number of changes and improvements have been made to the program. To make things easier for our administrators, we have postponed some of the changes that could have been problematic. Who advised her that it would be a good idea to make it more difficult for the farmers to access the advance payment program in the middle of a pandemic? Or did she just go ahead and do this on her own? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, we are constantly working with the administrators of the program. We are fully prepared to respond to their requests so that the advance payments program can best serve our producers across the country. larry maguire: Livestock producers are telling me that the premiums for the western livestock insurance program are too high. I told the Minister of Agriculture over two weeks ago that this was a problem, and yet she went out and said that farmers needed to make better use of existing support. When will the Minister of Agriculture listen to what the farmers are saying so they can actually use the existing programs? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, I would like to remind everyone that we have put in place certain measures to improve access to AgriStability. It is now $100million for pork and beef producers alone, not counting the $77.5million for food processors. larry maguire: Livestock producers in my riding and several across Canada are still waiting for the Minister of Agriculture's promise for an AgriRecovery program. When will the Minister of Agriculture stop rubbing salt in the farmers' wounds and provide the rest of the story she has been saying is on its way for over a month now in her AgriRecovery promise? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, we have committed $50million to beef producers and $50million to pork producers through the AgriRecovery program. Here is how the program works: the federal government contributes up to60% and then the provinces implement it how they see fit. larry maguire: The funding announced by the Minister of Agriculture for the livestock industry was insufficient, and what was promised has not been delivered. This has caused hogs to be euthanized and over 100,000 feeder cattle to become overweight. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, once again, we have significantly increased the amounts available through AgriRecovery. dominic leblanc: Mr.Chair, we know that not everyone experiences economic recovery in the same way. In some sectors, such as tourism, fishery, hotels and restaurants, we do not know when activity will resume or whether it will resume slowly. Given that the CERB lasts 16weeks, they are all afraid that they will be left with nothing. Chair, we moved very quickly at the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to support workersthose who have lost their jobs, who were laid off, or those whose jobs simply disappearedthrough the Canada emergency response benefit. Chair, the workers that the honourable member identified, including those who were not eligible for the EI, were also covered by the Canada emergency response benefit. We recognized the urgency of the situation, which is why we took action to support workers and their families through the Canada emergency response benefit. louise chabot: Mr.Chair, are we going to continue to help workers in these difficult times? The answer is simple. Can you do anything about it? Can I walk out of the House today and tell all those people that the CERB is going to be extended? hon. bill morneau (minister of finance): Mr.Chair, I would like to thank the honourable member for her question. Of course, we are looking at how we can gradually reopen our economy by continuing to help people to be in a good position. People are afraid to go back to full-time jobs because they are afraid of losing all their emergency benefits. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, we know that, with a responsible reopening of the economy, we have to look at our programs to make sure that we are keeping and protecting people. the chair: We are going to take a break so that our employees can change shifts without jeopardizing their health. While we have a few seconds, I would also like to remind members to address their questions to the chair, not directly to the ministers. Today, June 1, under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization, we celebrate World Milk Day. World Milk Day allows us to emphasize the importance of milk as a global food, its benefits for our health as well as our nutrition; and to celebrate the dairy sector, from the primary producers to the processors who ensure that our many high-quality dairy products get to the marketplace. Canadians are fortunate to have a thriving dairy sector that, under supply management, provides high-quality products at reasonable prices to consumers. Even under supply management though, dairy farmers have found themselves facing difficult challenges as a result of recent trade agreements and sudden market shocks as a result of the pandemic. Chair, to acknowledge World Milk Day, I'd love to be able to raise a glass of wholesome white or chocolate milk, but we can't do that. On the other hand, I must ask the Minister of Agriculture what the government is doing to support the dairy sector in these times so we can celebrate World Milk Day next year with more vim and vigour. Today it is particularly important to thank families working on the 11,000 dairy farms across the country, caring for 1.4 million cows to produce each year more than 9.3 billion litres of milk of the highest quality. The dairy sector in Canada is made up of more than 220,000 Canadians and foreign workers who dedicate their lives to feed us. While our society lives through unprecedented changes, the dairy sector demonstrates its resilience and proves more than ever the value of the supply management system. It is why we increased by $200 million the borrowing capacity of the Canadian Dairy Commission to improve its butter and cheese storage programs, giving the flexibility to manage the surplus of milk and support its mandate. Over the past few years, we have invested in dairy farms and given direct compensation to dairy farmers through trade agreements with Europe and Asia. Chair, last week a horrific video surfaced showing the killing of an unarmed black man at the hands of the Minneapolis police. George Floyd's death was the latest in a series of unwarranted deaths of black men and women at the hands of police. Since his death, solidarity protests have erupted across cities in the United States and all over the world asking for justice and a stop to systemic dehumanization of black people. I wish I could say we are, but sadly we are not immune to the reality of what is happening south of the border. The same protests taking place in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris and London are also taking place in our own backyard. In cities like Montreal and Toronto, thousands of people have already taken to the streets, not only to decry anti-black racism but also to ask for tangible solutions to effectively combat anti-black racism. We don't have to wait for pain, suffering and outrage to boil to the surface to act. As Canadians are demonstrating and calling on their society and governments to do better, can the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth tell us what this government is doing to address anti-black racism in Canada and to ensure we are evening the playing field for black Canadians? the acting chair (mr. If we as Canadians truly desire an inclusive Canada, every single one of us must step up, be an ally and do what we can to make workplaces, communities and public spaces safer. The open, transparent, merit-based appointment process is resulting in decision-making tables better reflecting Canadians. We recognize the UN International Decade for People of African Descent; the applications for capacity building in black Canadian communities are being assessed; the anti-racism secretariat is set up for Canadians but also for government departments to improve their systems, including advancement opportunities; and the recently announced immunity task force will provide disaggregated data to decision-makers because decisions need to be based on science and evidence. Although our government is moving in the right decision, there is clearly a lot more work to do and we are committed to doing that work with communities as allies, as partners. Chair, workers' unions, business leaders and analysts across the country are raising a huge alarm over potential bankruptcies due to COVID-19. For years the government has promised to change the laws to protect workers from corporate bankruptcy, but has failed to deliver. Will this government fix the law before more Canadian workers lose their hard-earned pensions? the acting chair (mr. I'd like to thank the member for Hamilton Mountain for that question and for his advocacy on this file. I remind the member that since 2015 one of our first initiatives was the repealing of Bills C-525 and C-377, which were anti-union legislation. Chair, the changes the government made last year to bankruptcy insolvency laws were largely cosmetic and won't protect workers' and pensioners' livelihoods once bankruptcy hits. The government can protect severance, termination pay, pensions and benefits from corporate theft, but will they do it, yes or no? the acting chair (mr. Chair, we made a number of significant changes in budget 2019, including that the process for the CCAA be more open and transparent. One thing we heard in the consultations was the ability for courts to set aside executive bonuses, and we implemented all those changes because we want to continue to protect pensioners. Will the government fix the lawsyes or noto protect workers' and pensioners' rights? the acting chair (mr. daniel blaikie (elmwoodtranscona, ndp): Thank you very much, Mr. Twice, following negotiations with the NDP, the government has committed to provide direct financial assistance to people living with disabilities. I have a lot of sympathy for people across the country who are living with disabilities and are getting impatient with the fact that alongside its initial commitment to seniors, for instance, the government made a commitment to helping people living with disabilities with the same kind of direct financial assistance, and it hasn't come. Why has it taken so long for the government to get around to helping people who are in a crisis right now? I want to know the reason why this hasn't been announced yet. We're moving forward with the Canada emergency student benefit, which will provide $2,000 per month for eligible students with permanent disabilities. We have done a lot, but we will continue to do more, and we will have more to share on our continuing efforts to support persons with disabilities. Their commitment was for direct financial assistance to people living with disabilities who are facing additional costs because of the pandemic. When are they going to get around to it? Why should people living with disabilities have to wait any longer than they already have? the acting chair (mr. Chair, that is precisely why we are listening closely to the COVID-19 disability advisory group to get expert advice. According to La Presse, federal cabinet ministers Steven Guilbeault , Catherine McKenna and Jonathan Wilkinson have been handed responsibility for crafting an economic recovery plan that aims to accelerate the green shift. True to form, this cabal around the Prime Minister has declared let's not let a good crisis go to waste. Can the Prime Minister confirm that his ministers have been working with environmental lobby groups for further financial support to engineer Canada's economy post COVID? the acting chair (mr. As we support Canadians through this time, we will also ensure our long-term economic, environmental and physical well-being. Our government remains committed to building a stronger and more resilient economy to ensure a sustainable, prosperous future for our kids and grandkids. Just like science is guiding us in our response to COVID-19, science will continue to guide us toward reduced pollution and in fighting climate change. greg mclean: The task force for a resilient recovery was quoted as saying last week that they would have recommendations for government action available within eight weeks, notably eight weeks when Parliament is, by this government's design, absent. Can the Prime Minister disclose to this committee how many meetings his 61 environmental activist advisers have had with the task force or its members? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, our most urgent priority with respect to COVID-19 is the health and safety of Canadians. While supporting Canadians during this period, we must also ensure our economic, environmental and physical well-being in the long term. Our government remains committed to building a stronger, more resilient economy to ensure a sustainable future for our grandchildren and children. greg mclean: The task force is a who's who of academics and bureaucrats, but surprisingly, includes no one from the productive part of the Canadian economy. The task force is reviewing work produced by Smart Prosperity, a government-funded institute whose membership overlaps with both the task force and the government's own Canadian Institute for Climate Choices. How many organizations does this government need to fund to recycle work produced by other redundant government-funded entities? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, as we know, our priority right now is the health and safety of Canadians. Just as science guides us in our response to COVID-19, it will continue to guide us in reducing pollution and fighting climate change. Our priority is to support Canadians during this period and we must also ensure our environmental, economic and physical well-being in the long term. Perhaps it's just a coincidence, but can the Prime Minister confirm if this is the same Gerald Butts who was forced to resign as his principal secretary for his role in attempting to force Canada's then justice minister into breaking the law? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, since the beginning of this crisis, our priority has been to support Canadians and their health and safety. We will continue to do so, because it is important that we get through this crisis by supporting Canadians. mona fortier: Once again, Mr.Chair, it is important to talk to Canadians right now to tell them that we are putting their health and safety first. Chair, is this the same Gerald Butts who, in his role as the principal secretary in the office of Ontario's then premier, advanced policies that now saddle Ontarians with the highest energy costs in North America? Is this is the same Gerald Butts who weighed down Ontario with the world's highest subnational debt burden, all for the benefit of new green jobs that, notably, have never arrived? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, as we know, for the past two and a half months, we have been supporting Canadians. chris d'entremont: Yesterday, the Minister responsible for tourism, ACOA and official languages was happy to close our national Tourism Week by announcing investments of $70 million to offset financial losses in the tourism industry across Canada. Southern Ontario received $30 million, northern Ontario received $7 million and western Canada received $3.5 million. Knowing that we just had an announcement from the Minister of Transport that there will be no cruise ships in Atlantic Canada or anywhere in Canada this year, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, where is the program for Atlantic Canada? hon. I know he's a very strong advocate for the tourism sector in Atlantic Canada, so I want to reassure him. Rather than doing marketing internationally, we will be supporting destination marketing organizations across the country, including in Atlantic Canada, to make sure that we launch this new movement to visit local. chris d'entremont: That would be all great if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic and you can't even cross the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick border without having to self-isolate for two weeks. In Saint John, New Brunswick, 79 cruise ships and more than 270,000 passengers will not be giving back to that local community. Prince Edward Island, which was expected to have a record attendance year, will lose visits of 97 ships and 154,000 passengers, and $60 million to the province's economy will be lost. Chair, my question to the minister is this: Who is ACOA going to be working with, and what kinds of programs are going to be available to help them through this very difficult year? hon. It is a bit like the canary in the coal mine; it was the first impacted, and definitely it is still impacted. Again, recently I had good conversations with the chambers of commerce all across Atlantic Canada, including Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador for the tourism sector. They wanted to have access to it until later in the summer, and it has been extended to the end of August. chris d'entremont: Mr.Chair, like the minister, last week, I spoke with Simon-Pierre Poulin, the director of Le Franco newspaper in Alberta, about the Sauvons Saint-Jean movement. He asked me why we could not continue to work on official languages and on modernizing the act even though Parliament is sitting in a different configuration. Unfortunately, I had to explain to him that many restrictions were associated with the current format of this fake Parliament. The Liberal government made a commitment to modernize the Official Languages Act in the first six months of its mandate. mlanie joly: Mr.Chair, it goes without saying that our two official languages are important and that, when it comes to language rights, we must always be on guard and protect what we have achieved. I had the opportunity to speak with my two counterparts in Alberta late Friday afternoon to tell them about our concerns and the need to protect the institution from drastic cuts. richard martel (chicoutimile fjord, cpc): Mr.Chair, some people for whom the 15weeks of sickness benefits were not enough before the COVID-19crisis now have to exhaust their regular employment insurance benefits before they are entitled to the CERB. Today, I would like to know whether they will be able to exhaust their weeks of eligibility for the CERB after October3. Chair, we ensured that those who switched over to the Canada emergency response benefit would be covered by it, whether they were EI eligible or not. We are committed to supporting all of the workers who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. richard martel: According to a survey conducted by the Universit du Qubec Trois-Rivires' research institute on small and medium size businesses, the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region would be the most affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. In fact, in our region, the tourism industry generates more than $300million in economic activity, including $58million for the cruise industry alone. mlanie joly: Mr.Chair, it goes without saying that the tourism industry is indeed very much affected. We are also providing the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance, as well as the $40,000loans from the Canada emergency business account. I am having good talks with various stakeholders in Quebec, including Martin Soucy from the Alliance de l'industrie touristique du Qubec. richard martel: Mr.Chair, the tourism industry in the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region is the sum of all its stakeholders. Overly restrictive standards will prevent some tourist accommodation from welcoming guests this year, even though they will have to pay their bills every month. We really want to be able to reach these small businesses, of which there are many in SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec and across the country. That is why the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have committed an additional $1billion to help those businesses that fall through the cracks. We need to respond now, and I will have more to say about it in the next few days. richard martel: Mr.Chair, I was very disappointed to see that we had lost asparagus crops due to a labour shortage. When I spoke with the blueberry growers in my area, they told me they were concerned that the same thing could happen to them. Chair, we believe that the flexibilities we have introduced to the Canada summer jobs program will enable more employers to use it, including more businesses, as well as help young people to acquire the necessary skills and benefits from this really important program. richard martel: Mr.Chair, on May19, the government said that it was studying several solutions to help business owners and entrepreneurs who operate their business using a personal bank account. Chair, small businesses are the heart of all of our communities, and we've been working really hard to help them. On Tuesday, May 26, she gained a new resident when Brinnley Lisette Huby was born to parents Adam and Carina Huby. Carina is my daughter, and that makes Brinnley my first grandchild and presently my favourite newest Canadian. Dave Epp: Minister Jordan, the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation is allowed access to the seafood stabilization fund, while you deny its competitor, our Ontario fisheries that fish on the Great Lakes, the similar right to apply. The Ontario inland fishers and the people in Ontario are eligible for other programs that are offered through the regional development agencies. We're making sure that we're addressing the concerns of inland fisheries as well as coastal fisheries. dave epp: Minister, will you then direct these regional agencies to provide equitable funding equivalent to the seafood stabilization fund? hon. Chair, we're making sure that they have the same access to programs through the regional development agencies as there is through the seafood stabilization fund. We're making sure that everyone who is in need of support through the programs will be able to access it. dave epp: According to Stats Canada, before my granddaughter turns one year old, her share of the federal debt will be over $39,000. What is Minister Morneau's fiscal plan for Canada so that the interest on this debt doesn't cripple Canada with higher taxes? hon. In that way we can have jobs and we can get through this pandemic and have a strong economy and be able to continue with our approach to managing our economy in a responsible the acting chair (mr. dave epp: Minister, when can Parliament, or this semblance of it, see that plan for economic prosperity? the acting chair (mr. We've been quite clear that we need to be transparent on a daily basis by giving Canadians an understanding of the investments that we're making through this pandemic. Chair, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said three months before the pandemic that this current government's level of spending and incurring of debt is untenable and that future generations, like my granddaughter, will have to pay for it. Chair, coming into this pandemic in a strong fiscal position with the lowest amount of debt among the G7 countries is a function of our economy that's afforded us the opportunity to invest on behalf of Canadians. dave epp: What is the budget for stopping illegal American guns from getting through our borders? hon. I can tell you that we have invested considerable amounts of money and have earmarked ongoing monies to ensure that we address the issue of illegal guns passing across the border. dave epp: What's the budget, then, to fight government-trained and licensed Canadians in the court challenge that's now been triggered? the acting chair (mr. dave epp: What is the budget for fighting the government-trained and licensed people who are now triggering a lawsuit against your order in council? hon. Chair, I don't have the answer to that question, but obviously the government will defend its position. Chair, COVID-19 has exacerbated the problem of this government's policy of spending the cupboards bare in good times instead of planning for a rainy dayand folks, we're in a storm. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities says they need $10 billion in targeted emergency operating funding, so do municipalities slash services, do they raise taxes, or will we be there for the municipalities? hon. chrystia freeland: Our government absolutely understands the crucial role municipalities play as the engine of our economy at all times, and particularly today, as in many parts of the country we are looking to restart the economy. That is why the Prime Minister announced just this morning that we will be accelerating payments under the gas tax fund. Many did their best to keep employees engaged and tried hard to not lose clients, as the government urged them to do. Thousands of business owners across the country will not be able to pay their rent today and risk closing permanently. Will the government push the provinces to include an eviction moratorium during the pandemic and make this commercial rent assistance program more flexible to ensure small businesses can survive? hon. Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for the question, which recognizes the very serious challenge that many small businesses are facing during the course of this pandemic. We know that the programs we've put forward, programs like the emergency business account, are supporting businesses, but the emergency rent approach, on which we've worked together with provinces, can also help significantly. Of course, the suggestion from the member that provinces take action in restricting evictions is one that I've been speaking about to ministers of finance from the provinces over the course of the last couple of months. Chair, this week marks the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and we are currently seeing repression of the democracy movement in Hong Kong. In spite of this knowledge, the Harper Conservative government signed a lopsided and anti-democratic investment treaty with China in 2012, the Canada-China FIPA. This Conservative deal gave Chinese state-owned corporations extraordinary powers to challenge our democratic decisions through a secretive private tribunal system. In the years since the FIPA was signed, with no vote in Parliament, Chinese state-owned corporations have been purchasing Canadian assets and resources. These corporations can seek financial compensation from Canadian taxpayers for the loss of potential profit when our laws and policies get in the way of their profit-taking. Can the government tell us whether any of these Chinese corporations has threatened to use the anti-democratic investor-state provisions of the FIPA to seek financial compensation from Canadian taxpayers? hon. franois-philippe champagne: As I'm sure the member will know, Canada is setting up with its allies around the world to protect the freedom and democracy that has been enjoyed by the people in Hong Kong. As he knows, we have issued a declaration with a number of allies we have called upon to make sure that measures remain in place to protect the freedom and liberty of the people of Hong Kong. We know that the one country, two systems treaty system has provided the framework under which the people of Hong Kong have been able to create an economy that is resilient and has made Hong Kong a place where people want to do business, commerce and trade. I would refer the member to the joint statement we have issued with the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. We have spoken with one voice and we have said we have deep concerns that the actions by Beijing, if they were to proceed with this national security law unilaterally, would undermine the bedrock of what has made Hong Kong, and that we will review the impact that the acting chair (mr. paul manly: That was a trick question, because this anti-democratic agreement states that we wouldn't be able to have permission to disclose that information if there was, in fact, an investor-state dispute. Unlike NAFTA, which had a six-month period for renegotiation, the Harper Conservatives locked us into a 15-year agreement with the FIPA and this anti-democratic agreement. Will the government re-engage the special committee on Canada-China relations so we can do a thorough investigation of this Conservative sellout of Canadian democracy the acting chair (mr. Canada will always pursue trade in the interest of Canadians, and we are in the process of reviewing our FIPA agreements so those agreements can provide the right framework for Canadians to trade, with the interests of Canadians always top of mind. Will the government work with the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation and inland fishers to develop and facilitate the delivery of an emergency package that works for them and find ways to redirect product to domestic markets, including communities facing food insecurity now? hon. Chair, we've recognized how hard the pandemic has hit our fishers and our fishing sector. One of the things we're doing primarily is the harvesters' benefit, which allows all harvesters to take advantage of a benefit as well as a grant contribution to help them get through. We're also changing EI so they can now qualify for their EI benefits based on previous seasons, not this one, recognizing they're going to face challenges this year. We are continuing to look at ways we can address the challenges within the industry and we'll continue to work with them to make sure we are addressing those needs. This government has sat by while the Canadian Transportation Agency issued a statement to back up the airlines' appalling actions. What is this government doing to fix this? Why aren't they ensuring that public funds involve reimbursing passengers and an equity stake for Canadians? hon. Chair, I certainly recognize the very difficult situation and the frustration of Canadians who would have preferred a refund. At the same time, at this point if airlines were required to immediately reimburse all the cancelled tickets, it would have a devastating effect on the airlines. That is why the Canadian Transportation Agency, which is an independent body, recommended that vouchers be issued and that they have a reasonable time to be usedtwo years. It is also very important to bear in mind that as we begin to exit this pandemic, we must still have an airline industry in this country. Chair, in Victoria housing and homelessness were at a crisis point long before the pandemic hit, but now people are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. If you don't have a place to live, you don't have the luxury of following public health advice and staying home. As part of the recovery, will this government be increasing funding to build or buy the housing needed to address homelessness? hon. Chair, very early in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our government provided $157.5 million directly to 51 community entities to respond directly to the needs of homeless Canadians. While the province has stepped up, it cost them $18.5 million to purchase just one hotel in Victoria. The $157.5 million, I must note, was additional money on top of the base funding that we provide every year to address the needs of Canada's most vulnerable. We are trusting the community entities to make the decisions on where the funding goes and to respond in a way that meets the the acting chair (mr. This government's national housing strategy reduces the level of targeted funding for lower-income households, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer. My question is simple: Coming out of the pandemic in the coming months, is the government going to increase housing funding to address the immediate need, yes or no? hon. Regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic, the last time I checked, we still had a democratic system and the government had to remain accountable. Does the government intend to extend the measures over the summer? If so, how will it do so? The government must also present its working scenarios for the economic recovery. Every day, we announce measures, of course, but also the cost of the measures and the amount of the investments. gabriel ste-marie: In my opinion, Mr.Chair, it will really be too late to do the economic update when things are more stable. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, let me confirm that we will continue to be transparent about the investments; it is very important. As I said, when the situation is a little more stable, we will have the opportunity to explain our situation with an economic update. gabriel ste-marie: Once again, Mr.Chair, when the situation is more stable, it will be too late to do an economic update; instead we will have to table a budget with the recovery in mind. Speaking of the recovery, the Parliamentary Budget Officer is surprised that the government is calling on the private sector for ideas for its recovery plan. Mr.Giroux points out that this government has thousands of public servants with very good ideas, and he adds that the government can also ask for the opposition parties' views. member that it is important to listen to what we are trying to do, and to listen to people's ideas and opinions, not only in Parliament, but also from our society. Of course, with our approach, we will address the economic recovery in a way that will ensure we can maintain our very strong position. gabriel ste-marie: Mr.Chair, we are still surprised that the government has contracted out its recovery plan to the private sector. It would help them to loosen the purse strings and be assured that there will be economic life after the pandemic. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, we feel it is very important to consider what we need to do in each phase of our recovery. At this time, it is necessary to consider the public health situation and the gradual reopening of our economy. Obviously, by gathering more information in Phase3, we will be able to consider more than one approach to recovery. I understand that the exact date for tabling the recovery plan may be difficult to determine at this time. Can the minister tell us whether he currently intends to table the recovery plan in a month ending in ber? If not, will it be before or after that? hon. bill morneau: We continue to work with the provinces on an approach to determine the timing of the recovery, and we are also listening to our colleagues in Parliament, of course. We were shocked to hear that his own Minister of Digital Government used WeChat, a Chinese social media site, to raise funds to sue a Global News reporterfor what? It was for daring to expose China's attempt to hoard PPE during the COVID crisis. Is it the practice of the government to support lawsuits against Canadian reporters who challenge the hostile actions of the regime in China, and will the Prime Minister now condemn the actions of the digital government minister? hon. As many members on all sides of the House know, WeChat is a social media platform used to engage and share information with the Chinese-Canadian community. In this case, the individual who violated the guidelines of the group is no longer a part of that group. Chair, Canadians have no reason to trust the Prime Minister on anything to do with China, especially when it comes to trade policy. Two and a half years ago, the Prime Minister travelled to China to commence free trade negotiations, and the talks ended up in complete failure and embarrassment. Still the Prime Minister continues to cozy up to the Chinese regime, refusing to ban Huawei from our 5G network or to speak out convincingly against China's oppression in Hong Kong. Can the minister tell us whether at any time during the last six months the Prime Minister or anyone else in his government has had discussions with China about a free trade agreement? A simple yes or no will do. Any work that we do on trade and on all matters will always be in the interests of Canadians first. ed fast: I think Canadians will see that the minister didn't even answer a simple yes-or-no question, so I'll ask her a simpler yes-or-no question. Is she or anyone else in her government presently discussing or negotiating a free trade agreement with China, yes or no? hon. Chair, we will always do our work, including any discussions on trade and indeed all of our work, with the interests of Canadians and Canadian businesses as our absolute top priority. Will the minister now assure Canadians that she and the Prime Minister's government will not negotiate a free trade agreement with China, yes or no? hon. mary ng: Any work that we do will always be guided by the best interests of Canadians and Canadian businesses. Will the minister tell us why she thinks negotiating a trade agreement with a hostile country like China is in Canada's best interests? hon. Free trade is a good thing when it takes place between like-minded countries that embrace free market principles and apply the rule of law. In fact, China repeatedly flouts international trade rules, illegally dumps underpriced goods into Canada, and prevents Canadian canola, beef and pork from entering China. Will the minister now assure us that our government will not negotiate any free trade agreements with China, yes or no? hon. mary ng: We are not in discussions with China on a free trade agreement, and as my colleagues, including the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, have said many times in this House and outside of this House, our priority continues to be the immediate release of Canadians detained in China. bruce stanton): This will conclude today's sitting of the special committee on the COVID-19 pandemic<doc-sep>anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): We'll call this meeting to order. Welcome to the fifth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Pursuant to the order passed on Monday, April20, the committee is meeting today to consider ministerial announcements, to allow members of the committee to present petitions, and to question ministers, including the Prime Minister, about the COVID-19 pandemic. Tomorrow, May8, Dr.AndreaMcCrady, Dominion Carillonneur, will give a special recital to mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Victory in Europe Day, VE Day, commemorates the formal acceptance of Germany's surrender by allied forces at the end of the Second World War. While the pandemic prevents us from gathering to celebrate in person, tomorrow at noon the voice of our nation will ring out in remembrance of this milestone in our history. Just so you are aware, the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee. I would like to remind members that, as in the House of Commons or committee, they should not take photos of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of the interpreters and to allow the meeting to proceed smoothly, I would ask you to follow some instructions. When you are ready to speak, click on the microphone icon to activate your microphone, or hold the space bar down while you are speaking. If you release the bar, your microphone will revert to mute, just like a walkie-talkie. Honourable members, I would like to remind you that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should you need to request the floor outside of your designated speaking time, you should activate your mike and state that you have a point of order. If a member of the committee wishes to intervene on a point of order raised by another person, you should use the raised hand function to indicate to the chair that you wish to speak. Should any technical challenges arise, for example, in relation to interpretation, please advise the chair immediately by raising a point of order, and the technical team will work on resolving them. If you get accidentally disconnected, please try to rejoin the meeting with the information you used to join initially. Before we get started, please note that in the top right-hand corner of your screen is a button that you can use to change views. Speaker view allows you to focus on the person currently speaking; gallery view allows you to see a larger number of participants. You can click through the multiple pages in the gallery view to see who is on and how many more participants there are. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. In addition, to ensure a petition is considered properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for a petition certified in a previous Parliament should be mailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. Chair, five years ago when Parliament passed Bill C-14, then justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said that it represented a finely tuned balance between access and safeguards. Petitioners on the first petition I'm presenting are very concerned to see Bill C-7 before Parliament, which removes safeguards ahead of that five-year review. Petitioners specifically mention their concerns about the removal of the mandatory 10-day reflection period, which can already be waived in certain circumstances. They are concerned about reducing the number of witnesses required to oversee it and ensure that a request has been properly made. The second and final petition that I will be presenting today is with respect to Senate Bill S-204. This would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who did not consent. This responds specifically to concerns about organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China involving Falun Gong practitioners and increasing concerns that this is being or about to be applied to Uighurs as well. Petitioners are noting that in the previous Parliament there were bills on this, Bill C-350 and Bill S-240. Now, in this Parliament there is a bill, Bill S-204, and the petitioners hope that this 43rd Parliament will be the one that gets it passed. This is my first occasion to present a petition in our virtual format of the COVID-19 committee. The petition I am presenting today, which was previously approved, is from a number of constituents who are concerned that we pursue the Paris Agreement to hold the global average temperature increase to no more than 1.5C. The Paris Agreement itself embeds in it the concept of Just Transition with a capital J and a capital T, the concept of just transition ensuring fairness and support for all workers in the fossil fuel sector. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to move forward with an act to ensure just transition and to ensure adequate funding so that workers and communities dependent on the fossil fuel sector receive meaningful support to ensure security in their lives in the transition to more sustainable energy use. I want to thank the honourable members for their usual collaboration and now we'll go on to mr. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): On a point of order, Mr. Chair, on Tuesday, at our COVID-19 committee of the whole meeting, I was asking a question which started at 12:56:06 and was cut off at 1:00:32, so I still have 34 seconds of time remaining in my question time of five minutes. If you believe that my time was unjustly cut off and that it was unfair treatment of the official opposition when we were raising our points of order, I would ask that the 34 seconds be tacked on to the opening round for the opposition and credited to Rosemarie Falk, who will be leading off for the Conservatives. the chair: Normally what happens is the chair uses judgment, and with 35 seconds, there isn't enough time obviously for a full question or answer, most of the time. I want everyone to know that I do have a timer next to me and I am timing the questions, and I will be treating the answers the same way. We've taken a little bit of the chair's ability to give judgment on it, but it will be from now on. I would like to remind the honourable members that no member will be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. Will the Prime Minister stand up for Canada's energy workers, or does he agree with the fringe left and those who want to destroy our country? ms. Chair, I believe that the language that the honourable member just used is unparliamentary mr. It is unacceptable to assert that anyone who wants to make a point about our economy is trying to destroy the country. As I pointed out this morning in my press conference, we cannot move forward on a transformation of our energy sector without supporting the workers in that energy sector. We need their innovation and we need their hard work if we are going to lower our emissions, if we are going to reach our the chair: We'll go to Ms. Chair, it has been 43 days since the finance minister promised Canada's energy sector liquidity through the Business Development Bank of Canada. If the government doesn't step up to support our energy sector, they are in effect doubling down on their support for foreign, unethically sourced oil. Chair, when will the credit options be available to Canada's small and medium energy firms? the chair: I want to remind honourable members that we do have interpreters who are listening and translating. Chair, from the very beginning, our priority through this pandemic and this crisis has been to support workers across the country. We have sent billions of dollars to workers right across the country, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, B.C., and Newfoundland and Labrador in the energy sector for them to be able to support their families through this difficult time. The announcements to date fall well short of what is needed to maintain a steady supply of affordable and healthy food. Instead of responding to specific COVID-19 challenges, our farmers are facing the Liberals' reannounced $125 million that was already budgeted in the AgriRecovery program. Will the Prime Minister finally step up and take our food supply chain seriously, or is agriculture just an afterthought for him? right hon. Chair, we take agriculture and our agricultural sector extremely seriously, which is why we announced hundreds of millions of dollars a couple of days ago to respond to pressing needs. We will continue to make investments to ensure both the safety of workers in our agricultural sector and the safety of our communities, as well as the continued flow of high-quality Canadian food onto our tables right across the country. Our farmers are faced with rising operational costs, a disrupted service industry, labour shortages and a reduced capacity at processing plants. When will the Prime Minister deliver adequate support to address the critical changes facing our ag industry? right hon. Chair, I would suggest respectfully that the honourable member take a look once again at the announcement we made, which actually highlights significant new investments to support our agricultural industry. Every step of the way in this unprecedented situation, we've been moving forward on doing more, on adjusting and on investing more. We need to support our agricultural sector and the people who work so hard to put food on Canadians' tables right across the country and we will continue to. Chair, Canadians expect to find healthy and affordable food at their grocery stores, but if the government does not take action now, that's not a given. It is an enormous hit to their bottom line, and the recent carbon tax hike is taking even more money out of the pockets of farmers at a time when they can afford it the least. Will the Prime Minister exempt all farm operations from the carbon tax and reimburse the money that they have already taken from them? right hon. Chair, it's a shame to hear the member opposite accidentallyunintentionally, I'm certainmislead the House and Canadians. This is the way of creating a better future for our kids and grandkids, which I know people in communities right across the country, including our farm communities, want to see happen. We are moving forward in a responsible way to put a price on pollution and put more money in average Canadians' pockets. marilne gill (manicouagan, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I am thinking about the lobster fishery in the Magdalen Islands, the crab fishery on the Cte-Nord or those fishing for herring in the south of the Gasp. Because imports have ceased, because the domestic market is weak and in decline because of the interruption of the tourism and restaurant industries, the fishing industry and its fishers must be supported. justin trudeau: Our fishers do exceptional work that is extremely important in feeding Canadians and in contributing to our economic success through their exports around the world. I know about the processing industry and the $62.5million to be used essentially for freezing products, but I am talking about the fishers themselves. In addition, they feel that they will be losing money, because of the drop in the price of their resource. They are just as essential as farmers, but they are going to have to work at a loss and they are not going to have workers to assist them. Are you going to do anything else, in addition to the assistance of $62.5million? Time is of the essence. We recognize the challenges that fishers must face in terms of social distancing and of work that is often seasonal. We are going to continue working with the industry, with the fishers, and with the coastal communities in order to ensure that people have confidence in their abilities and in their future. In times of crisis, it is important for the government to be there to support people, and that is exactly what we are going to continue to do. But, given the cyclical nature of the industry, some sectors have had to postpone for several weeks the preparations they need for fishing activities. The current program could be modified in a number of ways, to accommodate the cycle, the dates, and the size of the companies. They would really like to take advantage of the $40,000loan, but they cannot because of their payroll. I can already suggest a number of solutions to the government and to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, that would bring help to those businesses very quickly. The fishers carry on, because it is a duty for them, because they want to help us and to be part of the effort at this time of crisis. I would really like to hear a guarantee that they will be supported, that they will be able to put food on the table this year, and that they will be able to support the communities that often depend on the fishing industry, a major industry in those communities. justin trudeau: Minister Jordan has been working with the fishers, the fishing industry and the communities affected by the crisis since the crisis began. From the outset, our priority has been to support the millions of Canadians from coast to coast who have lost their jobs. We have been able to do so, but we are going to continue to work for those who must now face difficulties. the chair: Before we move to the next question, I would like to remind members of the committee to speak slowly, and to address their remarks to the chair and not directly to each other. They've seen revenues plummet, and at the same time the cost of delivering municipal services has risen. As the Prime Minister knows, municipalities are unable to run deficits and so they are facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that Canadians depend on. They're going to be even more important during the recovery, especially when it comes to delivering on the infrastructure programs before us. My question for the Prime Minister is, when can they expect federal financial support to arrive? right hon. Chair, no government in Canada's history has done more to work with our municipalities, with our cities, with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to respond to the challenges they're facing and to partner with them. Things from infrastructure to investments have made a huge difference right across the country in the quality of life of Canadians in towns, large and small, from coast to coast to coast. As I'm sure the member well knows, our Constitution requires that most of the funding for municipalities flow through the provinces. We are working with the provinces, as we continue to work with the cities, to ensure that we're able to support this order of government that delivers the vast majority of services to Canadians with very little financial means. Chair, it would seem that the federal government has the fiscal capacity and the responsibility to help municipalities weather this crisis. Transit systems have been hit particularly hard and have seen the bulk of the layoffs in the municipal sector. These transit services carry essential workers to work, whether they are health care workers, grocery store workers, janitors or others. We will see service cutbacks precisely at a time when we want to be expanding transit and improving transit in our communities. Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that the federal government needs to step in to safeguard and protect Canada's transit services? right hon. Chair, this federal government recognizes how important it is to support all Canadians, which is why we put forward unprecedented measures to help millions upon millions of Canadians with the CERB and with the wage subsidy. I'll be having a conversation with all other first ministers tonight to talk about a broad range of issues. We have continued to engage with them, but again, it is important to respect the Constitution and understand that funding for municipalities and cities does go through the provinces. The federal government is happy to be there to support, but it must be the chair: We will go to Mr. Chair, I am wondering how the Prime Minister could explain to a bus driver in Vancouver who has been laid off that as a public sector worker, she can't access the federal wage subsidy, while an equivalent worker in the airline industry gets to keep her job with the federal help of that program. Chair, I'm happy to explain to the member and to all Canadians that our Constitution creates federal areas of jurisdiction and provincial areas of jurisdiction. The airline industry, like banking, like telecommunications, is a federal area of jurisdiction that we have been able to move forward on. More than that, we brought the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy to all industries across this country, because we knew that as the federal government, it was something that we needed to step up on the chair: We will go back to Mr. Faced with minimal health care capacity, remote indigenous communities in my riding are taking matters into their own hands. The Nuxalk have put up a checkpoint on Highway 20 to protect community members and prevent non-essential travel. In particular, it is to protect the three remaining fluent speakers of the Nuxalk language, these cherished elders in their community. The Haida on Haida Gwaii have set up a similar checkpoint, as have communities throughout British Columbia, yet federal support for indigenous communities amounts to only $39 million for all of the indigenous communities in B.C. Does the Prime Minister not agree that more support is warranted to help indigenous communities in my riding and across the country? right hon. Chair, from the very beginning, we made funds available to Canadians right across the country, particularly people in indigenous remote or northern communities who we knew would be facing more difficult challenges because of the existing vulnerabilities in their health care system and socio-economic circumstances. We have made unprecedented investments and we will continue to make the necessary investments, because we need to make sure that indigenous Canadians, and indeed all Canadians, have the supports they need to make it through this crisis. luc berthold (mganticl'rable, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr.Chair. I am going to keep talking about the area of jurisdiction that the Prime Minister likes to talk about, except that I want to point out the incompetence of the Liberals in keeping their commitments on infrastructure projects. As the provinces gradually restart their economies, can the Prime Minister tell us how many projects that the provinces have submitted are waiting for approval from his government? mr. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, I hope that the length of the pause will not be taken out of my time. catherine mckenna (minister of infrastructure and communities): I'm sorry, Mr.Chair, I was on mute. It is very important to build projects that will create good jobs the chair: We are returning to Mr.Berthold. How many projects are currently awaiting government approval? I know that the minister has been meeting virtually with the provinces over the last few days. Rather than wait for the right political opportunity to approve these files, will the minister commit today to respecting the provinces and approving by next week all the projects that are sitting on her desk? hon. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, I'm pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories. We will announce the approval of projects because it's very important for our economy, our communities and creating good jobs. luc berthold: Does the minister understand that she hasn't told us how many projects are still pending? The construction season is very short. Approval of a project in July means that work can't begin until next year, which won't help revive our economy. catherine mckenna: I want to make it clear that we have approved hundreds of projects in the last few weeks. These projects are important for the economy and the environment, as well as for jobs the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, while the minister is calling for a green recovery of the country's economy, public transit is at risk. The Union des municipalits du Qubec estimates that the monthly losses are between $75million and $100million. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, we recognize the importance of public transit for our economy, since some essential workers use public transit. As the Prime Minister said, it's the provinces that must help because the money the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, once again, what we're hearing is that the government is passing the buck to the provinces. Unfortunately, the minister was unable to answer a single question about the number of infrastructure projects still on the federal government's desk, which is very important. In terms of the number of projects that we've approved, I would be happy to inform the hon. member of the exact number of all the approved projects that my department has been working very hard on over the past few months to approve projects to go forward. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, do I have any time left? the chair: No, your time is up. On March 28, the minister personally tweeted out a thank you to the People's Republic of China for donating PPE to Canada. More recently, Taiwan donated half a million surgical masks to Canada, yet here we are, two weeks later, and the minister has yet to personally thank Taiwan for its generosity. I can say, after my COVID foreign ministers call, that the world community has come together to make sure that supply chains will remain intact and that we will have transit hubs and air bridges. Chair, I didn't hear a thank you there, so I'm going to try again. On May 4, the Government of Taiwan delivered 25,000 surgical masks to the Government of British Columbia. Minister of Citizens' Services Anne Kang and Minister of State for Child Care Katrina Chen, who, as ministers, officially thanked the Government of Taiwan for its donation. Again, will the minister now do the right thing and, on behalf of Canadians, recognize the generosity of Taiwan and thank its government for that timely donation? hon. Chair, as I said to you before, Canada is grateful to all who have given supplies to Canada. As I said, when it comes to global health, when it comes to helping each other, I think it is a duty for all to come together. We are grateful and thankful for all those who have agreed to help Canada and Canadians from coast to coast to coast in times of need. I've repeated that and have said many times in many forums that we are grateful and thankful to all of those who are helping Canada. The Government of Taiwan has been the world leader in successfully fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, the People's Republic of China continues to oppose Taiwan's membership in the World Health Organization. Will the minister now do the right thing and assure Canadians that he will fully support efforts to grant Taiwan membership in the World Health Organization? hon. That said, we support Taiwan to continue meaningful participation in international multilateral forums, particularly when it comes to health. We also believe that Taiwan's role as an observer in the World Health Assembly meeting is of interest to the international health community and we have been supportive of that. Can he tell us exactly how many Canadians remain abroad who have expressed a desire to be repatriated? hon. As of today, we have repatriated more than 20,000 Canadians on 232 flights from 87 countries. As the Prime Minister and I have said from the beginning, we will make our best effort to repatriate everyone who wants to come back home during the crisis. My office has received correspondence from Canadians concerned that trial delays due to COVID-19 may result in criminals walking free. As this government has been working overtime to criminalize law-abiding citizens with new and useless gun laws, will the Minister of Justice ensure that real criminals will not walk free as a result of delays in the justice system? hon. We have been working with my provincial counterparts across Canada, as well as with the various federal courts and also, through my provincial counterparts, with the superior courts and courts of appeal across Canada. Each particular jurisdiction has taken measures to ensure that basic essential services within the court system are maintained, through a variety of means, and we believe that we will be able to solve these various challenges. Chair, the regional relief and recovery fund was announced weeks ago as a way to help small and medium-sized businesses in rural communities, like those in my riding. Can the minister clarify whether we are days away or weeks away from this support flowing to the businesses that need it so desperately? hon. Chair, I had the chance to talk with many of the chambers of commerce and business owners throughout Atlantic Canada, and we hear their anxiety. That's why ACOA's doing great work on the ground to make sure we can help them through this very difficult period. We have increased the budget of ACOAgood newsand I'll be coming up with the details very soon. It will be a pleasure to collaborate with him to make sure that we can help many businesses and business owners across the Atlantic region. In particular, they are unable to access the emergency business account, because they do not have a payroll. There are hundreds and thousands of small businesses in this very situation, vital small businesses in our communities, but they do not meet this requirement. What does the Minister of Finance have to say to these small businesses that are suffering right now? hon. I want all the businesses that he is talking about and all of them throughout the country to know that we continue to work very hard to make sure they're supported through this difficult period. We know that businesses are being supported through getting access to the wage subsidy to keep their employees together, and they're getting help, whether it's with rent or to defray costs by deferring GST and HST or customs duty payments. Some have a personal account that they've dealt with over the years rather than a business account, and that makes them ineligible. Chair, small businesses are concerned about their ability to survive, and no amount of deferrals, loans or subsidies can substitute for their need to be open and servicing their customers. Can the government confirm that a sectoral risk analysis has taken place to assist the provinces in reopening the economy? hon. Chair, I can assure the member that we've been very clear in terms of our strategy around reopening the economy. We need to make sure that we follow the advice of the experts and the health authorities to do so in a manner that does not compromise the health and well-being of Canadians. We of course will have a sectoral lens, and as you can see by some of the initiatives and the support packages we've put forward the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Can the government confirm that the programs currently in place will be expanded to these hard-working Canadians? hon. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we continue to work with all of our small businesses and I want to thank him for raising this very important issue. I want to assure our Canadian small businesses that we are going to continue to do this work to make sure they are supported. james cumming: Can the minister give me a date when she will be able to announce to these businesses that they will be eligible? hon. mary ng: I want to assure our Canadian small businesses of their importance and of the importance of their contributions to all of our communities. I want them to know that we continue to listen and that we will ensure that they are supported and continue to be supported during this difficult time. Can you give me a date when I can tell these thousands of businesses they will be supported if they pay dividends or if they use contractors within their businesses? hon. The landlord says that he doesn't have the 25% needed to be eligible for the program because he's already paying for common area costs and deferrals on utilities, which he will have to pay on his mortgage. Will the government reform the rent relief program to focus on tenants and not just the landlords? hon. Chair, I want to let the member know that we are working to make sure that the details of the emergency program for rent are out there so that both tenants and landlords can understand the situation. We're seeing a significant number of both landlords and tenants coming forward to register for this program, and we are convinced that it will be in the best interests of landlords to move forward and give tenants this relief. Chair, we've been hearing, however, from small business owners that their landlords don't find the government's rent relief program appealing enough. Can the government confirm, given the program's low eligibility rate, that the program will be expanded and be more efficient in helping tenants? hon. Chair, we recognize that it's critically important that all of the details of this program be out there for landlords and tenants to understand. This is a program that we've put out within the last week, and we are confident that it's in the best interests of tenants and landlords. One easy way to do that would be to expand the Canada summer jobs program to businesses with over 50 employees. Will the government consider doing so to allow students to gain that very valuable work experience over the coming months? hon. The second uptake provided employers across the country with the ability to add their needs for students to the mix. During this pandemic, the government has consistently called for a team Canada, non-partisan approach, and I was glad to hear that said a little earlier today. However, at the same time, the current government has used a parliamentary back door to launch a poorly thought out gun ban. We have a government that didn't win the popular vote, and I'm just wondering how I explain to my residents, because I'm getting so many calls, that this is not a bloated response because, quite frankly, it is. Chair, I think the honourable member can explain to his constituents that the forming of regulations through order in council is actually the process prescribed in law in Canada under section 117.15 of the Criminal Code. I would also invite the member to advise his constituents that way back in 1991, when there were some Conservatives who called themselves Progressive, the Mulroney government brought forward, in Bill C-17, the authority under that section for an order in council to prescribe specific makes, models and variants of military firearms as prohibited or restricted. terry dowdall: I'm not sure, but I'm hoping, that I'll get an honest answer on this question from the minister, who has everything from rocket launchers to basically toy guns on the ban list. When will we get the cost of this buyback program? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to please be careful in their language when they are referring to others. I won't comment on this one particularly, but I want all of you to be very, very careful when referring to other members. Chair, to respond to some of the obfuscations and deceptions that have been put out there. I think it's very clear, and I invite the member to look at the list of weapons that are the chair: We'll go back to Mr. bill blair: Actually, I'm very much looking forward to bringing forward legislation as soon as the House resumes. We will have a vigorous debate in Parliament about the form a buyback will take and we will bring forward a budget at that time. bill blair: If people are illegally in possession of the weapons and they're committing a crime, they will be dealt with for the crimes they commit. Canadians in my riding who suffer from cystic fibrosis are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. While these Canadians with existing lung conditions are incredibly worried about a virus that attacks the ability to breathe, the good news is that there are life-saving medicines for those with CF. I am wondering if and when the government will correct these guidelines and give access to life-saving medicines for our most vulnerable. Chair, as you know, the government has been very committed to improving access and affordability for prescription medications for all Canadians. The PMPRB regulatory amendments will help Canadians be able to afford their prescriptions, and Canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines. In fact, many countries with much lower medicine prices gained access to new medicines in the same time frame as Canada frame, or even faster, so we are excited to do this work. Chair, our seniors are being particularly hard hit right now during this pandemic, yet seniors have not been given any direct support. Funding to charities like the United Way is being labelled as support for seniors, but most won't see any of this support. Seniors in my riding have asked for an increase in their CPP and OAS, and to be able to make untaxed bulk withdrawals from their RRSPs while they still have some value. deb schulte (minister of seniors): I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. the chair: You might want to try your space bar and keep it down while you're speaking. I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. We've reduced the minimum RRIF withdrawal by 25%, and we've made the CERB available to working seniors who have lost their jobs due to the COVID pandemic. We know there's more work to do, and we'll have more to say in the future. the chair: I want to remind honourable members that if there are issues, we are taking note of them, and we'll hopefully resolve them by the next meeting. marie-hlne gaudreau (laurentideslabelle, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. In fact, we have been looking at a number of ways to support increased contact tracing across the country, including working with provinces and territories to boost their capacity through human resources and volunteer organizations. Anything we put forward as a digital tool to assist with contact tracing would be thoroughly considerate of Canadians' privacy rights. But you know as well as I do that the Privacy Commissioner has been calling us to task for a very long time now, because there is also a crisis of confidence. You know as well as I do that for 90%of Canadians, the misuse of their personal data is a cause for concern, whether it be for profiling or business development purposes. I'd like to know whether this commitment will be implemented quickly so that legislation can be passed on this issue, in this case the Privacy Act. We're talking about what is going on in Quebec, among other places, and I would like to make sure that the federal government commits to respecting the proposals regarding geolocation and contact tracing possibilities, with full respect for the right to privacy. We have worked very closely with provinces and territories for a long time before the outbreak, but certainly ever since the outbreak. We respect the rights of jurisdictional authorities to use tools that have been properly vetted through their own provincial and territorial legislation. marie-hlne gaudreau: Concerning privacy, there are 30million Quebeckers and Canadians who have had their personal data leaked. Why is it that our laws don't allow us to apply financial penalties so that we can then go further? The very basis is to be concerned about our fundamental rights. As the critic for access to information and privacy, I'd like a commitment that the federal government will deal not with what the provinces are doing, but with the Privacy Act. the chair: Your time is up, but I'll give the floor to the minister for 30seconds. Our government will ensure the privacy of Canadians is respected, support responsible innovation and take reasonable steps to strengthen enforcement powers. yvan baker (etobicoke centre, lib.): Thank you very much, Mr. Minister, in my riding of Etobicoke Centre, we are mourning the loss of 40 residents to COVID-19 at the Eatonville long-term care centre. Of all Canadians who have died from COVID-19, 79% were living in long-term care homes. I understand that long-term care homes fall within the jurisdiction of provincial governments in Canada, but this is a crisis. What is the federal government doing right now to help protect our seniors who are living in long-term care homes from COVID-19? What will we do to reform our long-term care homes in the future to ensure that our seniors in Etobicoke Centre and across Canada get the care they deserve? hon. We are deeply concerned by the outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities, and our thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one. As my colleague mentioned, while these facilities are regulated by provinces and territories, we have been focused on protecting the health and safety of long-term care residents and staff while working with our partners in a team Canada approach. We're working with the provinces and territories to cost-share a temporary salary top-up for long-term care workers. We are working through investing $2 billion to secure personal protective equipment for the health of workers, including those in the long-term care homes, and we've deployed the Canadian Armed Forces to assist 25 long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario. We all have a role to play to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect our seniors and caregivers. At the finance committee, we've heard a lot of concerns from all sectors of the economy as a result of COVID-19 and we've been presented with quite a number of possible solutions as well, several of which the government has acted upon. It is very welcome support, but I sincerely believe the farm sector will be taking the Prime Minister up on the suggestion that $250 million should be seen as an initial investment. However, as a result of reduced processor contracts for next year, plus cancelled seed contracts, millions of dollars of seed and process potatoes have no home. How does the minister see Tuesday's announcement addressing potato farmers' concerns? Second, in 2013, long-term financial safety nets were gutted by the Harper government. We know the importance of our potato farmers, and that's why we are launching a first-ever surplus food purchase program, a $50-million fund designed to help redistribute existing inventories, such as potatoes, to local food organizations. On the financial safety net that we have in place for our farmers, called the business risk management program, we announced up to $125 million in funding through AgriRecovery and made changes to AgriStability that will help producers quickly. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that BRM programs, including AgriInvest, are there to help farmers in difficult times. Robyn, who has owned Arbutus Health in Tofino for over 13 years, can't apply for the Canada emergency business account loan, simply because she doesn't have a payroll of over $20,000. With no business income and without emergency financing, it is virtually impossible for her to pay her bills or come up with the 25% needed for the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program. The government promised to be flexible and willing to adjust its COVID response rollout so that nobody falls through the cracks, but Robyn, like tens of thousands of proprietors who are the economic job creators of our communities, urgently needs the government's help now. Will the government amend its programs to help more business owners so that people like Robyn don't lose their businesses? hon. I know he and I have talked about this, and I appreciate the input and the feedback that he is providing from business directly. I want to assure Robyn and her businesses, and many businesses across the country, that we are absolutely listening, and we will continue to make sure we are supporting those businesses during this period. We also know that more has to be done, and we will continue to work with you and businesses across the country so that we can indeed give them that necessary support to weather this difficult period of COVID-19. I was talking to Heather last night, who also owns a business in Tofino, Basic Goodness Pizzeria, with her partner Marco. Like many proprietors of family businesses who aren't on payroll, they don't qualify for the business loans. Now with the new rollout of the rent support, they're not sure if their landlord is willing to play ball and even apply. Heather was in tears last night as she told me that they have done nothing wrong to deserve being excluded from these emergency programs. Will the government fix the rent support program so that tenants can apply, instead of leaving it up to landlords, and so businesses can get the help they desperately need? hon. We've been working on offering a response for small businesses and charities and non-profit organizations, and we are continuing to listen on the ground to how we can better assist the businesses that fall through the cracks. Chair, when the government rolled out its commercial rent support program, why didn't it negotiate an eviction moratorium with the provinces, as Australia and other countries did, to protect business owners? hon. We've recognized it and we've been working with the provinces and territories to implement the Canada emergency commercial rent the chair: We'll go back to Mr. gord johns: To qualify for the Canada emergency wage subsidy, a 30% drop in revenue has to be shown. Anyone who's owned a business knows that even with this program, it's going to be hard to survive. Why is the government using a 70% measurement drop to qualify for the rent support program, but a 30% drop for the wage subsidy? hon. We've been working with provinces and territories to provide forgivable loans to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rents for their tenants by 75%. We're hoping that tenants and landlords will be working together so we can support businesses during this very difficult crisis. the chair: Before we move on to the next question, Mr.Berthold, did you have a question or a point of order? mr. I checked the clock from the first round of five minutes, and as you may recall, it took a very long time for me to get an answer from the government. During my first turn, it took 50seconds before a government minister deigned to answer my questions. After checking my time, I realized that the discussion between Ms.McKenna and I went on for four minutes and 14seconds, so I wasn't able to ask the minister one final question, a very important one. I would ask you to take that into account and allow me to ask MinisterMcKenna one last question, please. the chair: The person chairing the meeting uses their judgment and does their best to keep an eye on what's going on. I think it's more or less equal for all the members, but I apologize if the honourable member feels that he was denied a few seconds. bill blair: The decision to close the border was made in Canada by Canadians in the best interest of Canadians. todd doherty: When will the government be in a position to inform Canadians of any changes to the agreement? hon. bill blair: I'm pleased to advise the member that we're continuing to monitor the situation, but I'm strongly of the opinion that the circumstances on both sides of our border do not indicate that this is the right time to make a change in the restrictions. todd doherty: Can the government confirm whether there are any discussions about reopening the border to certain modes of transportation and restricting others? the chair: Before I go to the minister, I want to remind the honourable members that we do have translators, and they are trying to translate. With respect to them, I know we're trying to get as many questions in as possible, but they do have to translate them, so please be considerate of our interpreters. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Let me please inform the honourable member that we are, of course, aware that the current agreement expires. navdeep bains: We are engaged with the industry, and we are working with them on a solution, Mr. Chair, will this relief package include funding for airline ticket refunds similar to what other countries around the world have done? Yes or no? hon. Chair, I can confirm that Air Canada has now adopted a policy of checking temperatures for passengers boarding Air Canada flights. Last week I asked the Minister of Labour if they were aware of a letter written on April 6 by CUPE to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Minister, were you aware of that letter? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly. todd doherty: On April 6, CUPE wrote a letter to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Before that I had conversations with CUPE with respect to flight attendants and the use of personal protective equipment. todd doherty: Can the minister confirm whether or not they have provided PPE to the flight attendants and/or training for front-line staff for airlines and airports? hon. This has become a policy to ensure the safety not only of passengers on board but also of the flight attendants and flight crew. He stated that he couldn't give his small business tenants a break on rent because the government is penalizing him for paying off his mortgage. Chair, as you know, we laid out the CECRA program just last week, and we are encouraging landlords to take that opportunity to support the renters. Is the minister aware of this, and are they trying to revise the CECRA program? hon. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with provinces and territories to present that program. We are asking, actually encouraging, landlords to do their part and help tenants, like the one you mentioned, go through this. It's been heartbreaking, frankly, to hear that everything they've built and sacrificed for is in serious jeopardy, and through no fault of their own. Your government has created programs that are supposed to help them, but many legitimate businesses aren't able to apply. I'm hoping to hear specifics, not just nice words, on what you're going to do to help them. First, businesses that recently incorporatedfor example, in late 2019are unable to apply their entire 2019 payroll. As a result, many are falling short of the $20,000 payroll threshold required to qualify for this loan. What is your government going to do about these three scenarios? the chair: I just want to remind honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly to the minister. As well, please take into consideration the interpreters, who have to listen and translate, so that we can have this conversation. Right from the very beginning, we've always said that we will listen and that we will work to make sure that measures go out to help our Canadian small businesses. She's absolutely right: 98% of all our businesses in this country are small businesses, so they absolutely contribute enormously to our communities and are job creators. For the Canada emergency business account, over 550,000 small businesses have been approved and are getting that support. I can assure the honourable member that we will continue to do this work so that businesses, all businesses, are supported, whether it is helping keep your employees together, helping with rent support, helping to keep your business's expenses low, or of course helping with the capital that is needed so that you can pay your operating expenses and your bills through this difficult time. Moving on, there are two issues regarding the 50% commercial rent assistance subsidy, where landlords pay 25%, the government pays 50%, and the tenant is responsible for 25%. First, many of the small landlords aren't able to take a 25% hit to their income, and are unable to provide the subsidy to their tenants. Second, with the 70% decline in revenue threshold for small businesses to even be eligible for the rent assist, many restaurants are at 65% or 67% decline. What is the government planning to do to streamline this program for small businesses that can't access but desperately need the rent subsidy? hon. Chair, as the Minister of Official Languages, I just want to raise the fact that interpretation is very complicated right now. In order to make sure that we can continue to uphold bilingualism within the House, I would love it if my colleagues could take down the pace a bit. I just want to remind everyone again that when you're asking a question, make sure you are doing it at a pace at which you're considering the people who are interpreting ms. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with the provinces and territories to provide this forgivable loan to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rent of their tenants by 75%. It will be very important that we understand what happens across the country, and we will monitor and adapt the program as we ms. Chair, it has been in the media quite a bit that this rent subsidy is not helping many, many, many small business owners. It's falling short of everything that was announced, so I think it needs to be taken a bit more seriously than that. We know that some still fall through the cracks and we will look at how we can continue to support businesses across the country. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We are now going to Mr. Three weeks ago, on April 17, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced funding of $500 million to assist Canada's arts, sports and cultural sectors. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Madam Chair, we will be releasing the details of that announcement, and how the money is going to be spent, in the coming days. kevin waugh: We all know that many media organizations, large and small, in Canada are struggling right now. Allegations have arisen that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, is currently engaging in predatory behaviour and taking advantage of the current situation to harm its competitors using rate cuts. kevin waugh: Local community and ethnic media outlets and papers have strong ties to their communities that often go much deeper than the major media outlets. Is the government currently using any local or ethnic media outlets to provide crucial coronavirus information through advertising? hon. We need to get the information to Canadians on COVID-19, which is why we have started an ad-buy campaign of $30 million, which is being distributed in more than 900 local, regional and national newspapers across the country and 500 radio and TV stations in 12 different languages, including Farsi, Mandarin, Spanish, Italian and many more. It has received two ads from an ad agency in connection with the $30 million the government is doling out to help media outlets. Is this the kind of money you're attempting to dole out to help media: two ads in eight weeks? hon. steven guilbeault: Madam Chair, we have been doing a number of things for our media in Canada over the last few months and will continue to do so. On top of that $30 million ad-buy campaign, we have been investing $50 million in local journalism. Just this year, it means that 200 journalists will be hired in areas across the country where journalism is more poorly defined. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, last week, as the minister would know, 15 community newspapers, including eight in Manitoba and seven in the province of Ontario, closed their doors for good. Is the government currently planning any further measures aimed at assisting community or ethnic media organizations? We understand that many more will close their doors within the next 30 to 60 days. steven guilbeault: We are planning a number of other measures, some of which will be included in the $500 million. Of the $595 million that the media will receive, we have a tax credit that has now entered into force, and the cheques should be in the mail by the end of the summer. So there are a number of things we've done and a number of things we will be doing in the coming months as well. kevin waugh: Well, finally, you have the five members associated with that committee to dole out the $595 million. colleague that in order for us to provide tax breaks for the 2019 period, media outlets had to file their tax returns so we could go ahead. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. This being the first time I've had the floor during a virtual sitting of Parliament, I'd like to take this opportunity to greet my fellow members, all 259participants. I'd like to talk about the Prime Minister's appearance on the show Tout le monde en parle. This is what he had to say about his economic recovery plan:     We are going to remain focused on the economy as a wholeinnovationresearch and science, the green economy and a fairer economyThere are things we are all reflecting on right now that reflection is going to continue. Can the government assure Canadians that it is being proactive and working on a plan to get the economy moving again? It must act now. Our government is wholly committed to restarting the economy, and we are working closely with the provinces to do just that. Last week, our government, together with the provincial and territorial premiers, released the principles that will guide efforts to restore economic activity across the country. jol godin: MadamChair, before we go any further, since it took a while for the minister, or the government, to answer the question, can I have that time back to ask questions? the acting chair (mrs. The Prime Minister's answer during his appearance on Tout le monde en parle didn't inspire much confidence and doesn't line up with the Deputy Prime Minister's comments. How can the government be proud of announcing $252million in assistance for the agri-food sector, when that is less than 1% of all the program funding the government has committed to help Canadians get through the COVID-19 crisis? Clearly, the government doesn't see the food supply chain as a priority and has no regard for farmers and pork and beef producers. Does the government realize that eating is vital to Canadians? When is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food going to adjust the program and show respect for Canadian farmers? hon. This week, we focused on beef and pork producers and processors, as well as sectors with product surpluses that can be redirected to food banks. I can assure my fellow member that this is an additional step and that more supports are on the way in the weeks ahead. PortneufJacques-Cartier is home to a company that is already licensed by Health Canada and that, for 20years, has been manufacturing medical equipment including masks, face shields and thermometers. In mid-March, Health Canada reached out to the company to find out how much equipment it could manufacture to help fight COVID-19. The company confirmed that it could immediately start producing 200,000masks a week, ramping up to a million masks over the next few weeks. Can the health minister tell us why, 45days later, this company licensed by Health Canada hasn't received an order? hon. Industry and suppliers have enthusiastically answered our call to equip Canada with products and goods during the crisis. Seniors living alone are most at risk of economic insecurity, particularly single senior women, as gender inequality in the job market has translated all too often into inadequate retirement income. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a poverty reduction plan that addresses the unique challenges faced by older women? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to assure the member that we are quite aware that this pandemic has typically affected single seniors, and many of those, given that they live longer, are single senior women. I want to assure her that we are working on this issue, and we have provided some supports already through measures such as the GST supplementary payment. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, older women represent a high proportion of residents in long-term care facilities. Having spent their lives caring for parents, children and often their partners, they find themselves needing care in nursing homes. Multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Canada have highlighted systemic gaps that senior and elderly women may face in such facilities, as well as the working conditions of the female-dominated ranks of nurses and personal support workers. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a federal strategy for long-term care homes that recognizes quality of life for residents and working conditions for the employees, ideally one that goes hand in hand with a poverty reduction plan and enhanced home and community care investments across the country? hon. We are obviously deeply saddened by the outbreaks that have been going on in long-term care facilities and those who have lost their lives. We do recognize that the administration of long-term care and palliative care is the responsibility of provinces and territories; however, we have been taking a team Canada approach, and as you already know, we've been doing tremendous work with them to try to ensure that those who live in those facilities can be well cared for and safe. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, from May 4 to May 10, we are observing Mental Health Week. We know that our essential workers right now are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety, on top of putting their own physical safety and health on the line. Most of these workers work in precarious jobs with no access to paid sick leave or vacation, and without any benefits to access mental health services. Apart from the very welcome investments in online resources, can the minister explain how the government will support these workers now and once the crisis is behind us? hon. I'm so glad that she's raising the issue of mental health and in particular how poor mental health is oftentimes connected to our socio-economic status. We do have new resources that are available to all Canadians free of charge through the Wellness Together portal, but there is more to do. I think the announcement of top-up wages, for example, which the Prime Minister spoke about today, is another example of how we're taking the health and wellness of all low-income Canadians very seriously. We know that mental health is not divorced from socio-economic status, and I look forward to working with her more on other measures that we can take together. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, we're all very aware of the importance of temporary foreign workers and their role in ensuring our food sovereignty across this country. How are we protecting them? Madam Chair, will the government take action to strengthen legislation and ensure Canadians have access to the food they need while the workers who help bring it to our tables have safe working conditions, regardless of where they are working in this country? hon. We are very concerned, as are countries around the world, that we support and create the environment for the health and safety of our temporary foreign workers and we value their contribution to our food supply chain here in Canada. We have issued guidelines to employers and are working very closely with local public health authorities in the provinces and territories to make sure workers are protected, that physical distancing and other recommendations are adhered to and that there are severe consequences if employers don't take care of their workers. alistair macgregor (cowichanmalahatlangford, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. My first question is this: Will the Liberal government prevent federal bailout funds from going to companies that use tax havens and avoid paying their fair share here in Canada, yes or no? hon. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): We are working to make sure that anyone who tries to circumvent the rules faces serious consequences. Anyone who abuses the program could face fines of up to 225% of the subsidy amount as well as five years in prison. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, I didn't really hear a yes to that question, so I'll repeat it. Does the government really think it's appropriate for tax-avoiding corporations to receive funding provided for by taxpayers? hon. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, the agriculture funding announced by the government earlier this week amounts to less than 10% of what the Canadian Federation of Agriculture estimates will be required to help farmers weather this crisis. I have to remind my colleague that we have put in $5 billion through FCC, $50 million for the temporary foreign workers, two times $50 million for pork and beef producers this week, and $77 million for food processing. This is only the beginning, and we should not forget that the business risk management programs are still there to offer support. alistair macgregor: Yes, Madam Chair, but we're nearly two months into this pandemic and this announcement only came this week. marie-claude bibeau: Madam Chair, we are working closely with the farmers and their representatives to identify where the gaps are, but once again, we have made improvements to the AgriStability program. They can get, depending on the province, either 50% or 75% in advance payments, and they can also, right now, access their AgriInvest program. There is more than $2 billion ready to access today, if they have the acting chair (mrs. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, federal disability recipients and seniors on fixed incomes have been hardest hit by cost of living increases from COVID-19. If we acknowledge that $2,000 per month is the minimum needed to get through this time, why are they being asked to survive on far less? When can they expect assistance, and how much will they receive? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to make sure people realize that we have provided some assistance through the GST supplementary benefit. We are also providing support to those who are still working, and we have done that by allowing them to access the CERB. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, as I think we've heard through today's question period, there are countless example of this government designing programs to exclude many small businesses that desperately need help. Whether it's the payroll requirements or other eligibility, we still, to this day, almost two months into the pandemic, have too many small businesses falling through the cracks. Madam Chair, why has the government taken this approach and when can we finally expect fixes to the whole system? hon. mary ng: Madam Chair, right from the get-go, we have been committed to making sure that Canadians are helped through this crisis, and that small businesses get the support that they need, so that we are saving businesses and jobs in this country. yves perron (berthiermaskinong, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I hear the questions my fellow members are asking, and to be frank, I don't find the answers satisfactory. It is well and good to talk about existing programs, but they aren't working, so enough with that refrain. This morning, both farmers and processors came together for a press conference at the Union des producteurs agricoles's head office in Longueuil. Can the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food therefore tell us when she will announce significant supports for the industry? hon. marie-claude bibeau: We have already announced significant amounts of support, and more is on the way. It's not that the programs aren't working; it's that they aren't generous enough in farmers' eyes. That's why I'm working with my provincial counterparts to make improvements to programming, including AgriStability. After using the online AgriStability benefit estimator, a pork producer found out that he would get $11 per head, as they say in the industry. Pork producers are calling for $20 per head, so it's a good start, even though it's not enough and it isn't what they are asking for. We want to keep working together, but farmers have to access the money available to them through AgriStability. Even before the crisis, we were hearing from people in the industry that the programs were neither suitable nor sufficient. A few days ago, the government announced $50million in funding for pork producers, even though they are asking for $20per hog for 27million hogs. When is the government going to announce a whole lot more in funding support? What's been announced so far is only 10% of what farmers are asking for. However, I would point out to the member that, when it comes to AgriRecovery, we made an exception to the rule. That's two funding envelopes of $50million each to help cover the additional costs from the decrease in plant processing capacity. As the Prime Minister said, we are going to do more, and we are moving forward step by step. yves perron: What we concluded in committee this week is that the $125million is not new money. The government can't say that programs already exist and, at the same time, claim that they are new programs. Everyone knows that the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement came into force a month earlier than planned, despite the promises that had been made. An easy way to make money available without committing new spending is to provide compensation and announce programs for supply-managed sectors that got nothing. It seems to me that a time of crisis is a time for the government to practise some judo and announce measures. I am reaching out to the government, as I always do, but it has to come forward with announcements. marie-claude bibeau: Our commitment to farmers in supply-managed sectorsmeaning, egg, poultry and dairy farmersis as strong as it always was. Support for poultry and egg farmers is in the form of investment programs, which aligns well with the recovery. At this time, we are focusing on emergency programs to help farmers hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. As you know, legislative changes are needed to grant the Canadian Dairy Commission's request and increase its borrowing limit by $200million so it can buy more butter and cheese. Chair, we're all inundated, as we've heard during this entire question period, with Canadians' concerns about the economic restrictions and the social restrictions that they're under. Over the last couple of months, the WHO has given one very consistent message in terms of coming out of those economic and social restrictions. Tedros said in his briefing, We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. On March 25, 44 days ago, he said, Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictionstheyre also the best way to prevent them. Does the minister agree with the WHO that relentless testing and tracing are critical to a successful economic and social relaunch strategy in Canada? hon. Absolutely, we agree that testing and contact tracing will form an important part of our response to living with COVID. We've been investing heavily in ensuring that we have the lab capacity, the collaboration across provinces and territories, and the variety of testing options to help us increase our capacity to test. We are aiming right now for a high volume of tests, but I will also say that in Canada we have one of the highest testing rates in the world. Although we're doing well, I can assure him that I am with him and I believe we need to do more. Chair, as I mentioned to his colleagues yesterday, we have currently the capacity to do approximately 60,000 tests per day across the country. Chair, it's hard for me to get that exact number, but I will get back to him with the exact number. She said, As a first tranche, roughly close to 60,000 is where the provinces can potentially expand to as a target already. Does the minister happen to know, ballpark, what the average number of daily tests in Canada has been since that statement? hon. patty hajdu: Your estimate was slightly higher than what my estimate was going to be, so that's a great piece of news. Listen, I will just say that I think if the premise here is that we could be doing more testing. I would agree, but I will also say that the provinces and territories are working incredibly hard on testing strategies that meet their own specific needs. Tam works with all the chief public health officers across the country to ensure that their testing strategy is going to be applicable and appropriate for their particular jurisdictions. mike lake: Following up on that, is there a jurisdiction in Canada where relentless testing is not the appropriate strategy as provinces consider relaunching? hon. For example, in British Columbia, where there are relatively fewer cases in general and less disease activity, they may have a different testing strategy than a province like Ontario, which is currently struggling with more outbreaks. mike lake: Given your comment that our current testing capability is 60,000, and acknowledging that only at one point in the entire history of our COVID response, over several months, has our weekly average been over 30,000it was about 31,000 for one day on a rolling basisMinister, are you satisfied with our current testing amounts right now, given that we're testing 50% of what the public health officer advises would be best? hon. patty hajdu: I'm so amazed by the work the provinces and territories have done in a very short time to increase their capacity. We are supporting them with the tools that they need to get more testing done, but also to have other components in place that will allow them to do the rapid tracing of positive cases. I think it's very important to remember that testing strategies will be different across the provinces, based on the outbreak disease epidemiology. Having said that, I know that we can all do better, and I'm certain that my counterparts feel the same"

        "Query": "What were the team's decisions and solutions regarding the remote control's visibility, ease of finding, and prevention of loss during the discussion of technical issues, market interests, and the function of \"glow in the dark\"?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed various options for the remote control design. User Interface suggested a base station next to the TV, but it was deemed technically complicated and costly. Marketing proposed implementing an audio signal, which was ultimately adopted. There were debates about where to place the logo on the remote. Project Manager suggested printing it on a button, but User Interface was concerned about wear and tear. Industrial Designer suggested putting it on the back, but visibility was an issue. User Interface proposed a two-piece remote, but it didn't align with the cover design. Finally, it was agreed to leave a cut-out space on the latex covers to display the logo. The team decided on a beeping feature for when the remote gets lost and a fixed charger to prevent loss. Marketing suggested additional features like beeping or blinking lights when clapping, and a signal when in a dark spot. However, voice and clapping were deemed insufficient, and the team settled on glow-in-the-dark material combined with speech recognition for easy location. This choice was cost-effective and believed to boost market sales.",
        "Article": "project manager: and everybody's name and what your function is ? marketing: Yeah , that's a good plan .   my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are    deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . project manager: Yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training well , the tools are , I think , we already I guess the tool is really our the computer , as far as I can see . project manager:  we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what  we have come up with . Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . marketing: See if I r See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And remember you have to press so it works . project manager: And you're Francine , right ? Would you like s like just to see  how it feels , so that you have a little idea ? user interface: Yes , I'm Francina . project manager: In marketing: Am I supposed to wipe off that or project manager: No , no . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Here's the project finance  which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . project manager: So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera . Now ,  the discussion I guess is  does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? marketing: Oops . project manager: I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em , right , everyday . project manager: And  now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , industrial designer:  . project manager: have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ? user interface: Yeah , I industrial designer: Yeah . Like  the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou  it should be used f  for some other purpose also , like controlling the  temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . project manager: So it should be a multi-functional  gadget that would  control all your household   machines basically . marketing: We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . project manager: It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . All the almost all the remotes project manager: Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . project manager:  so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . marketing: I think another thing that would help is  if it beeps when you clap , project manager: Yes . project manager: That is true , user interface: project manager: because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . project manager: And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my my remote control yeah ? marketing: industrial designer: project manager: Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . marketing: So some industrial designer: Yeah , some beep or something like that , project manager: Yeah . user interface: Or a b marketing:  so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink . industrial designer: so that we can go project manager: So if lost If lost  signal with b throw signal , you know . industrial designer: Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . project manager: I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or industrial designer: Beep or  it's a light , maybe it's a light . marketing: And do you think a good c c  clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? project manager: Okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot ,  meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like  , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? marketing: project manager: In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , marketing: Okay so user interface: Yes . project manager: right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think  voice or clapping it's not specific enough .  I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , marketing: project manager: but I think they only work to certain degree and marketing: But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . project manager: What with industrial designer: Yeah , of course , that didn't user interface: Then , in that case marketing: Well , because you're s because you're silly . marketing:  it could be on well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table industrial designer: marketing: project manager: Okay we have  marketing: you know , well maybe we have to move along , okay . project manager: yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here . I think you all did you get  notices on your computer for this ? Okay so well , you got the notice  industrial designer: Me yeah . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_  who is this ? The industrial designer That's you . project manager: industrial designer:  working design , yeah , it's it's  mainly technical-functional design . project manager: Then And then the technical funct you are the technical function , industrial designer: Yeah , functional design , project manager: so so you are the working design . project manager: And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . user interface: project manager: And , you know , specifi you you will get specific  instructions for that . project manager: I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions  ,  I guess , you can  user interface: Okay <doc-sep>And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . 'Kay , and just to reiterate  after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control .  basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: So I don't know if we want to go with that  and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . I don't know really ,  I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to project manager:  . marketing: rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend , project manager: Right . marketing: and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , project manager: Right . marketing:  so design preferences ,  we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that ,  'cause we talked about that being a problem . user interface: marketing: And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle ,  it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . user interface: Either refresh it , or it sh project manager: Y user interface: Oh wait , maybe I didn't put it there . project manager: user interface: Okay ,  looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . user interface:   can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . It's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section  with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and  and very simple , but technologically advanced . So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it , but Anyway , next . user interface:  there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by  by sight . You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . user interface: And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up .  but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy ,  sort of old-fashioned in a way . user interface: Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . project manager: user interface:  it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo .  and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch , so it's like they ch watch , you know , the C_ Beebies or something like that , project manager: user interface:  keep them away from other channels . On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using . So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction . user interface: And then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . user interface: But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of  , b or we'd like the the button size on this . project manager: What's the title ? industrial designer: It'll be copy of component design . So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode ,  contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want .  personal preferences ,  to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse .  if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power .  I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that . We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer . project manager: industrial designer: I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters marketing: That would be amazing , though , yeah . So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . marketing: What is that ? industrial designer:  that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . And  so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .  the manufacturing division also has said that  they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber ,  you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes . Where were we ? user interface: Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , project manager: Sure . user interface: and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . user interface: Right except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are ,  there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , project manager: user interface: but I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions . So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , project manager:  . user interface: or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this . marketing: Yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . marketing: I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really project manager:  . marketing:  we could do it , but project manager: If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology industrial designer: Well , we are making the chip . industrial designer: So ,  But , I guess , we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . industrial designer: I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . marketing: Yeah , 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy . project manager: Okay , that kind of brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . project manager: Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ? marketing: Oh the base , yeah . project manager: The base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? industrial designer: I think the p user interface: I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like , before project manager:  . user interface: 'Cause if it's something really really small , then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up project manager: Yeah , and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ . marketing: We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want project manager: What size battery and user interface: Well , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , marketing: and exactly It could be like this . user interface: 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . marketing: I'd , well  This one is really comfortable , like I like the sides whatever , user interface: Are you gonna lose it easier ? marketing: because But if we have the  , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that . industrial designer: If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . user interface: it's like You know Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ? marketing: Two double A_s , for this size . user interface: But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . industrial designer: Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact project manager: Right . I agree , it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just marketing: Yeah . project manager: Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? You wanna vote ? marketing: I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced . project manager: I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: That just seems so clunky and industrial designer: 'Kay so marketing: Yeah , because  if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , user interface: Smaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah . marketing: yeah industrial designer: The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash . project manager: user interface: Oh watches I've but I've never washed a cell phone . project manager: Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ? industrial designer: Pieces everywhere . user interface: I was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then I would probably lean away from that . marketing: Yeah , 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive . industrial designer: However , project manager: What would you recommend ? industrial designer: well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: right ? 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , user interface: Yeah . marketing: We could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Are we restricted by this ? project manager: I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm industrial designer: Well the original user interface: Twenty five Euros project manager: not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of industrial designer: Okay . If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think . project manager: Okay , so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ? industrial designer: Honestly I'd recommend like  project manager:  . industrial designer:  since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a  soft like latex , project manager: industrial designer: because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . industrial designer: We could do  one that fits in with the trends of the year so , marketing: Oh . industrial designer: because this year is all fruit , God only knows why , user interface: marketing: Yeah , who knows . industrial designer:  we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know project manager: Okay . user interface: So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ? marketing: O or we could like take off this . industrial designer: So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start . Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ? industrial designer: How complicated Are we gonna go with the voice activated user interface: Yeah . project manager: I don't think we should do voice , I think we should just do  the recognition for when it's lost , you know . marketing: 'Cause that  what it type of , yeah , for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like , project manager:  . marketing: because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time . project manager: marketing:  see I'm  I'm strangely attracted to it , because I know that's it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , I don't know , it's just so high-tech . user interface: Well , my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . user interface: And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off . But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , right ? marketing: Yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder . marketing: But do can your can the department make industrial designer: That would be like a mid-class  Yeah . industrial designer: So we don't actually have to go for Well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip . project manager:  and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ? marketing: I think triple A_ , it'll be lighter . industrial designer: I think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? So they're more widely available now . industrial designer: Well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , user interface: Right , that's what I meant . project manager: and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? It might be the four way scroll , too . marketing: as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle . user interface: Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , project manager:  . user interface: because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? marketing: Good point . industrial designer: In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , user interface: Yeah . marketing: So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? project manager: Yeah , I like that . marketing: But we definitely If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled . marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , if it's just up and down marketing: like on the side of it . We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , project manager: So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know . user interface: Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . W industrial designer: We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available . user interface: Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that . project manager: I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , user interface: Which button ? project manager: I don't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , I don't know , but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one . Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? Every cover ? industrial designer: Yeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . project manager: If we want it to be visible and  are all those those one that you showed where they were  s met silver-metallic looking ? But those are plastic , right ? user interface: Yeah .  but , or if it was really industrial designer: For our base one ? project manager: Yeah , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool . marketing: Yeah , project manager: What are your thoughts ? marketing: or like a gun-metal grey , project manager: Gun-metal gray . user interface: Well , w w then what's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ? I guess . Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing . industrial designer: There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual user interface: project manager: On the back ? user interface: But you don't marketing: But we want it to be seen . project manager: 'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery . The other option is , I don't know if you can see it but it's like if project manager: I can find it again . project manager: Well , for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly . You see at the bottom , it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . project manager:  user interface: And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . project manager: Okay , yes user interface: If c you envisioning it ? project manager: yes . user interface: And so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes . industrial designer: The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , user interface:  . industrial designer: so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . user interface: That's like , you know , a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened . user interface: And so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ? marketing: Some of tho Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based .  and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . marketing: Like if we like the one all the way on the left ,  you ca you can see it on your computer better . marketing:  where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . Any other ideas or thoughts ? We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so user interface:  . user interface: Did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before ? project manager: I think there will be time for that later .  next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , and here's what we're each of us going to do . The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design . I think you're going to get a lot of , the final say on what buttons get put We'll all talk about it , but I think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , right ? user interface: Yeah . Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay <doc-sep>industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>industrial designer: project manager:  so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . industrial designer: Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please  open  I'm participant two . project manager: industrial designer: Okay so  the first thing  I have done is to to made a review together with the  manufactural  department and have which components was  available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and  kinetic  well  kinetic  technique to to store the energy . user interface: marketing: industrial designer: We also  we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . But if we use battery industrial designer: Yeah b  f well  I meant  by by battery I meant  I will not have a  a wire between the remote control and the energy source but  I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . But  well it's not a a re  well a real issue for the from the technical  point of view . Concerning the interface  we can we can put  just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons  much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic  energy  collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered   environment . For the case  well  I think that  titanium is  is a good choice because it's trendy and it's  it's  well it's modern and  user are are are  will be  very happy to have a a a nice remote . For the interface  I think that we can ach achieve  all the desired functionalities by s just  using  rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are  well cheaper . user interface: What is this single curved what does it mean ? industrial designer: Well   i i it's  it's the the shape of the  of the remote . user interface: So it's it's not industrial designer: You you will have the well  the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the user interface: Yo l yeah . And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? industrial designer: Yeah the  that's the point . The kinetic one is  y you can recharge  by the  user interface: That that's what it means by kinetic . industrial designer: Yeah and by well by just by moving the ar  your arm the  well the remote will  accumulate energy . industrial designer: But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote  all the necessary energy . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market . Wha industrial designer: So  you're right we can  see in our  R_ and D_  if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . industrial designer: Oh yeah user interface: industrial designer: I take care , it's all right . user interface: So the titanium case is the normal case that I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . There's another point I want to make , is that the  well you've seen them I le na my presentation that  I point out some why buttons are not the  not the only ways you can use Yeah . So the user interface is  i it uses the aspect  of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user project manager: user interface: and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have  we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . user interface: So some people are propose voice recognition and so ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company industrial designer: user interface: when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . user interface: And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly .  so somebody some people use  some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the  buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well . So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and   and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And then they also secure  covers , to protect  secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . industrial designer: user interface: T_V_ remote controller where are you ? project manager: user interface: And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , for example . industrial designer: project manager: We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? user interface: Is it possible ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:  ? industrial designer: Yeah but  as Norman say if  there is  already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check  to integrate it i into our  new remote control . And  , this is another one where you can  the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you project manager: user interface: up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . user interface: And here are is  here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . user interface: And basically  industrial designer: Well I I think you it's it's it's fine you have  reviewed all all the possibilities user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but   well  i if we consider that  the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee  we need much buttons in the remote project manager: user interface: industrial designer: since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say  and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ . So wi marketing: But people are often enough looking at the help , project manager: If the if marketing: once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . industrial designer: But  wel well I think project manager: It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . project manager: So marketing:  it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the project manager: So it's the same marketing: Same remote with some project manager: Can be used by both kids and old people . Well  what I s propose is that  you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube , industrial designer: user interface: is  a small device that  looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the  the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . project manager: Maybe for kids , kids they like  t no l they like to user interface: Small industrial designer:  well . project manager: marketing: So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l  they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . marketing: so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . Most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the T_V_ . marketing: So they're frustrated a lot user interface: marketing: And  if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . marketing: So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . marketing: So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . industrial designer: Well  w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having  L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and  display on the screen . industrial designer: It's marketing: - ? industrial designer: yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce and it's not really marketing:  as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . marketing: So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . The thing marketing: We just play around industrial designer: Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you , s project manager: You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , user interface: Yeah . user interface: If you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display project manager:  . user interface: and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ , marketing: Yeah . marketing: So industrial designer: So I th I I well I think we we can focus on the  on the fancy look on the  user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but well I think L_C_D_ will  will  make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . So i is marketing:  yeah we have  project manager: user interface: so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . project manager: industrial designer: user interface:  maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time . industrial designer: And marketing: And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . marketing: the scroll button , from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . Yeah I think that marketing: Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button . industrial designer: Yeah I I I think that  well  as we have seen in the in the presentation  well  about   fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button user interface: Don't use the buttons . But project manager: But they are just less used compar marketing: They're not used much . industrial designer: But the  the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: and you project manager: Or maybe we can u  or maybe we can  make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . marketing: industrial designer: But if i i if we if we could have a a a display  g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient , user interface: Yep . marketing: Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands . industrial designer: Yeah but marketing: So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . industrial designer: Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen marketing: And accordingly you can just increase or decrease . industrial designer: so i i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at , so . project manager: And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . user interface: I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button industrial designer: user interface: and the same for the volume and the channel , marketing: Yeah . user interface: if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ , marketing: Okay . user interface: with the help of speech recogniser you can marketing: better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like  find user interface:  . industrial designer: and when the remote control  hears fine well yeah just  to make him beep or t project manager: You will listen to a peep , special peep . marketing:  it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , user interface:  . marketing: so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . marketing: And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the  remote control beeps , wherever it is . marketing:  it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , project manager: But you don't you don't have to move the the charger . user interface: That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s  instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . user interface: because  every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . user interface: So it's it's  it's all about strategy , y marketing: And of course the final point is a fancy look . marketing: As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy , user interface:  . marketing: I think we should have something it industrial designer: Well the last one with the  yeah with the two parts was  original , so user interface: With  two two two parts controller . marketing:       you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him . marketing: So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even user interface:  . industrial designer: Well we can think about  having  on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can  well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids ,  things like that . project manager: Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just yeah just push  kids button so it's automatically user interface:  . marketing: I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think industrial designer: So for  project manager: Yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the  the prices difference  of what to use , where to use , and s  and so on . marketing: Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th  these could be included . I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: because  if you want  say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . user interface: but if name the channel by by name industrial designer: Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like  sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with   well with sports program playing now user interface:  . You see  if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on  basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five project manager: Yeah it's yeah . marketing: So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers industrial designer: Well but well e every possible word  has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . marketing:  the the you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . marketing: Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent user interface:  . marketing: and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . user interface: But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . user interface: You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . user interface:  ? project manager: Because you have to s t  a ch user interface: Well , it's convenient for the user . marketing: Then project manager: Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , user interface: The    . user interface: I I think that I have   I think there's another way you can do is that  you can  if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button  , you just you you just choose the the option you want marketing: Yeah , the . Just you have  in the beginning you have  t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . industrial designer: Well I  I also project manager: By associating each channel with the name or industrial designer: I I also think about  another problem , if if there is  more than one person who is watching T_V_ project manager: And for each one has his own . user interface: industrial designer: the s well the the speech  r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . industrial designer: Because  I remember when I was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time user interface:  . project manager: Or you have to s user interface: Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that . industrial designer: so it's a pr it could be a problem if  if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty and just run , s user interface:  . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad  reputation for our company . marketing: So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . industrial designer: Yeah that's well I think that's a good  a good option because it's simple and  simple to implement also , so . industrial designer: marketing: Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are I think we can just press the okay <doc-sep>project manager:  minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we  had decided on roles for each of you , however ,  there are some changes that I've got from on high user interface: Okay . project manager: that  are a bit  well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the  this is for a specific television . project manager: actually I'll get to that at the end point number four ,  we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . marketing: user interface: marketing: Sh do you want me to hold it ? project manager:  there we go , just screw 'em on in . Gonna have to swap them round so marketing: So , after that ? project manager: now , it was function F_ eight .  , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , yeah sure . project manager: marketing: yes , I have to look at the  market potential for this product , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? Then project manager: P press F_ five to start it first . A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . And what we got was , we found that if you  , what they th what problems they are having with different  remote controls available in the market . So , we have to put stress on this ,  we have to take care of this fact also like our design ,  should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers .  and even  the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high  pay more for this  good looking remote controls also . So even if the available market goes for the available  even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better  better look  designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . marketing: Then And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users  or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if  the consumers they want to use it . user interface: So , sorry I was just gonna say , what was the question for this ? Or is are you coming on to that ? marketing: Ah t look all the market potential , what  how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . So these percentages are are what ? marketing: Yeah , these are different age group persons like  sorry , I can open it in another way . If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to  pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this  this  point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . industrial designer: marketing: So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from  fifteen to thirty five , user interface:  . marketing: and I  and I think that most of the users of the rem  T_V_ are belong to this age group . marketing: So , and project manager: marketing: And then project manager: Fifteen to twe marketing: Yes .  if we look at this data how how  h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . project manager: marketing: They find that thirt  thirty five percent  thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl  spe  proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see  to know how to operate these remote controls . marketing: So this is also a very goo  major factor to loo  take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . user interface: Yep , sure , that's cool ,  marketing: Yeah we have to take that out . user interface: Okay , and then what do I press , F_ eight ? marketing:  F_ eight . user interface: Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big project manager:  F_ five . user interface: F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? marketing: Escape . project manager: F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just  the left button for advancing . user interface: Okay , so  I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry ,  I'm concerned with  w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and  I'm I'm also I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , project manager: user interface: so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? project manager:  just a left  user interface: The arrow ? Okay . user interface: So  I looked at existing designs and also  the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike .  and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main  buyers of of our T_V_ I think . user interface: And ergonomics , we said  , I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , project manager: industrial designer: user interface: but  maybe that comes up , I don't know . user interface: And the findings , well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set .  , so they need to be included , but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . I don't know how to get to them , project manager:  if you if you escape then you can see your bar . user interface: You know they're grey , they've  this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , project manager: user interface: and they don't look very exciting at all .  , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , project manager: user interface: but there you go , that's what we're up against , project manager: user interface: and I think we can do much better than that .  , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite  important ,  project manager: Yeah , particularly if we've  there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well . And  I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand-held more  not as  computery and project manager: Organic .  simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , marketing: project manager: user interface: so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . user interface: hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just  released  I think is it a a remote control for presentations or  and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so  project manager: Yeah it's like a , yeah . user interface: Yeah , no seven inches isn't that big but  anyway  so hand-held and portable and  m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , project manager: Right . project manager: And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for  to keep down the production time . And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark project manager: user interface:  which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . user interface: or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . industrial designer: So  , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , user interface: Okay ? industrial designer: and  I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?  , or if project manager: user interface: industrial designer: is that a function we want in the remote ? project manager: do you have trouble whistling ? user interface: I haven't been able to industrial designer: I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right . industrial designer:  it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? project manager: Yeah , I suppose that's true . user interface: - , yeah project manager: Well I suppo  you could y you could have the user interface: or some sort of voice project manager: you could have the basically  instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? . industrial designer:  a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping  , shouting , you know , project manager:  . industrial designer:  and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ? project manager: Sounds good . So I plug it in , press F_ five ? Function F_ five ? project manager: Function F_ eight for the  the  industrial designer: Or function F_ eight ? Okay . So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , user interface: industrial designer:  so it's good you went first , project manager: Alright . industrial designer: and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and  what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . industrial designer:  so Raj told us that  consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and  he also mentioned that  the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour .  , a lot of the buttons aren't used , and  he mentioned that they're not fun to use . And  a novel feature which  we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , project manager: industrial designer: there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold  it'll pick up as a a distress signal  from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . But sure surely that would have to be  sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . industrial designer: Well maybe you could have a   tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . industrial designer: Yeah well tha that's  for later down the road  , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy ,  and not computery , user interface: industrial designer: right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . project manager: industrial designer: And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our  our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , user interface: industrial designer: which include , you know ,  space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains Or  or a high speed train . project manager: Ah is that what that is ? user interface: industrial designer: Right and having personally worked with all these products  I have a great deal of experience with  with industrial design of these . If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . project manager: industrial designer: You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and  user interface: project manager: marketing:  . Give it one button user interface: industrial designer: and and it's a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us marketing: project manager: industrial designer: I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but project manager: Right okay . industrial designer: Yeah it's a g  you could have a you know a project manager: Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? industrial designer: Right . marketing: Fifty million was  prof project manager: Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta  we've g marketing: As a profit . project manager: gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic  , you know ,  that should be just like  a tenth of the price maybe or less . industrial designer: we don't wanna have it project manager: Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? industrial designer:  . user interface: That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries . project manager:  if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , user interface: A battery in it , kinda . industrial designer:  the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we  of course will have alternatives like  speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power project manager: Okay . user interface: industrial designer:  and lastly the transmission interface is  , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . industrial designer:  so here's you know , a great schematic that my  apprentice designer gave me . project manager: user interface: industrial designer:  as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and  you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so  personal preferences , I think  programmable options which  just require a small amount of memory ,  non volatile memory , just  so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . And the  , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting ,  more technical  expenditure of effort project manager: user interface: industrial designer: and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . project manager: Right , also so  a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is let's see , I'll find it myself ,  Ta industrial designer: Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in . project manager: We had that  to dis-include teletext  because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . project manager:  it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , user interface: Okay . project manager: and  instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . project manager: And the logo  the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics  I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor  , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . project manager: Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . project manager: now , we had as listed options we had industrial designer: project manager: speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface  we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read . project manager: So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a user interface: Well project manager: or it looks like we're just cutting on the  user interface:  . project manager: I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . project manager:  maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send marketing: About cost . project manager: some information about that , about  what people , whether people would require  teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . So  I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . project manager:  so  a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of  web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav  sorry Raj  said people didn't like . project manager: If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever , user interface: project manager: I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far user interface: Yeah . project manager: but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have  it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple . project manager:  glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? user interface:  marketing:  . So marketing: I user interface: so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . marketing:  actually I think it's really really very important point  as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . But user interface: Often lost s was that , marketing: yeah are lost project manager: Lost , yeah . But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , user interface: marketing: like if they come and speak something at the remote control  replies to something something and it glows in the dark . Both these factors  both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , project manager: That's cool . user interface: - , marketing: and this will definitely enhance our  market sales , project manager: That's cool . project manager:  speech recognition I take it user interface: industrial designer: Oh it's project manager: I don't , I've I know of no products  that use speech recognition well . industrial designer: They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like  B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . project manager: Really ? industrial designer: Yeah , it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . project manager: Yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . user interface: industrial designer: Right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , project manager:  . user interface: Well what about industrial designer: user interface: this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about  something that's built into the T_V_  that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something project manager: Ah , that's a good idea . user interface: If you find if y industrial designer: Right and then it would do just you know ,  subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . industrial designer: What you could do then would be you have  a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't  expect  the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s . industrial designer: But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker project manager: That we should just stick on , yeah . industrial designer: Right , and then the remote control would know  what's being produced by the television . project manager: And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap . Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . You just say you know ,  whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to  turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . And  you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . user interface: That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete .  so I think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , user interface:  . project manager: So I think if we're going to go well  like the thing about the there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of  organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . project manager: but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . user interface: Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said  colours and fashion w were important so maybe  just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . industrial designer: Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just  the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then  if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it  it won't glow any more . project manager:  Okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , user interface: Yeah , project manager:  if we're gonna have to user interface: 'cause what I thought , main project manager: if we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our  slogan . project manager:  then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . 'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can  still see the remote control . project manager: Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of   of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then .  so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? industrial designer:  yeah we're getting a lot of features now , I I think project manager: Well  I think I think the sort of find the finder things  it's  I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . project manager:  industrial designer: Well , I think a consideration too is that these  remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around , user interface:  . industrial designer: there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or  get damaged . user interface: So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ? project manager:  no ,  that was going on ravs  Raj's sort of  marketing research I guess . So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff ,  industrial designer: Yeah  . project manager: If you could find out that  marketing: Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi project manager:  I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a industrial designer: Oh . project manager:  expensive , user interface: Yeah you think so ? industrial designer: Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . industrial designer: And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , project manager: Is it not the circuits that cost industrial designer: like a project manager: Oh right , okay . industrial designer: project manager:  well that kind of takes back the R_F_ the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well . marketing: project manager: Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? industrial designer: Okay . And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , user interface:  project manager: programmability . project manager:  user interface: if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick .  can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . industrial designer: project manager: And  I'll put any I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so  user interface: And where is it sorry ? project manager:  pro  project documents . industrial designer: So it should be when you save project manager: On A_M_I_ scenario controller . marketing:  it is in shared documents ? industrial designer: And then  hit that little folder up thing again . project manager: And I will tr getting strings of  information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than industrial designer: project manager: I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so user interface: Okay . project manager: So user interface: What I thought as well about the material is  maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like  this kind of rubbery material , it's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . user interface: The rubber rather than project manager: More sort of  flesh-like than plasticky sort of . marketing:  but we have to take care like project manager: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . user interface: marketing: So we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . industrial designer: user interface: Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good ,  project manager: Yeah . user interface: industrial designer: We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . marketing: project manager: industrial designer: And there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . project manager: yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry . user interface: Yeah , d with the colour ,  does it have to be all yellow , do you know ? project manager: Please God no . project manager: my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so I think just having it user interface: Yeah . project manager: And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the user interface: Cool . project manager: what was it ? We put we put fashion into Whoops , it's not working . project manager: Okay , that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion and opinions on choosing a stylish fruit for remote design.",
        "Summary": "The market research conducted by the Marketing department suggested that the ideal design for the remote should be spongy and resemble a fruit or vegetable. After considering options like banana, apple, and pear, the banana was chosen due to its appealing color and recognizable shape. The Marketing team believed that the current trend of incorporating fruits and vegetables into fashion in Milan and Paris indicated that a remote with a similar style would be both fashionable and technologically innovative. They also considered the pear as a potential shape for the remote, as it is easy to hold and preferred a spongy material for its durability. The Project Manager supported the use of spongy material and prioritized the inclusion of a wheel, as it would set their remote apart from competitors. Additionally, the Project Manager agreed that the banana would be a suitable choice due to its ease of identification.",
        "Article": "So , we will first start by summarizing the  the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .  I will take notes during this meeting so  that you can  look at my  folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . We'll then t take decision in concert and then   we will  define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . We have also  the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ user interface: Abdul al-Hasred is my name . industrial designer: I_D_ you want ? project manager: Maybe I can switch slide  on your request . industrial designer: and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the  the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a  a wheel control . So   I was looking basically for that chip , which is  very very standard , and  I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . industrial designer: And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . Yeah project manager: So will will will this with  including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be  lower than twelve Euros to produce ? industrial designer: I I th But I don't think that  we should We should talk about  the design of the box also which needs some money . project manager: Okay user interface: Also have to say industrial designer: But user interface: Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? industrial designer:  that's all user interface: No ? project manager: You received something industrial designer: yeah . But I guess it could be project manager: And could it be adapted ? user interface: I guess it's possible . project manager: Okay and there can  recognize some commands and stuff ? user interface: Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as  as a chip project manager: Okay . project manager: Okay maybe we can just  listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . industrial designer: Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry , I haven't written my personal references .  the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , project manager: Okay .  , what is the purpose of the light ? industrial designer: Just to to make something which is  slightly more design that  a squarey box with a rubber user interface: Is project manager: You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? user interface: But But in th in the dark  Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? project manager: It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ? user interface: But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . user interface: But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . industrial designer: I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but  the bill starts to be user interface: Okay . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , industrial designer: First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light user interface: yeah . industrial designer: and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device user interface:  . project manager: But it can be  battery consuming , no ? To have the light always on ? industrial designer: Yeah , a little bit . user interface: So I just look at some current designs  on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because  th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just  reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . project manager: And also does it  fit well in hand ? Because it was  th your wrist problem with the usage . We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . user interface: So , from the bottom or whatever is there ,  the  the numbers and then the top ,  until the ten also , this middle part , project manager: Yeah . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . user interface: Yeah , if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . Will be down or user interface: So that they're separate a bit , project manager: Okay .  and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but  , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t  tuning the channels and stuff like that . user interface: We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . user interface:  so we could just basically use one just wheel and  user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . So we can move to the Is there any question ? For designer of user interface ? or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? Okay . marketing: Can I ? So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control  . So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . marketing: And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends ,  fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form project manager: Okay . project manager: marketing:  I don't know which material can be spongy , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and if you project manager: This is good also for user interface: Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , industrial designer: Yeah . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is  technological innovative , and after the easy to use . marketing: Yeah that's why project manager: Has it ? marketing: Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand project manager: Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well . D D Is is there anything you want to add ? user interface: Is there any fruit that is spongy ? marketing: project manager: I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . industrial designer: And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ? project manager: But that's not in the trend . user interface: You can make it  marketing: project manager: The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . marketing: project manager: I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . project manager: So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's  easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit  any others idea you have . What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? marketing: user interface:  . industrial designer: You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , user interface: Two of the button , yeah . industrial designer: but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and here you have a a push button to marketing: But you don't have project manager: I think it's a good idea , yeah . user interface: Yeah so you can just have  just have this curve , yeah , and you move  your hand here to press the buttons and then you move  on the other side . user interface: So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool , project manager: Yeah . user interface: no ? project manager: I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . industrial designer: If you if you start with  fancy fruits and fra s and tha user interface: Ah-ha . industrial designer: Oh , yeah marketing: project manager: Yeah it's really  really a good point . marketing: user interface: Now who are recording this meeting ? project manager: I think it So One second . So ,  so for marketing: project manager: sorry , for  component , so industrial designer: So project manager: we have to think about those aspects , sorry .  what do you mean by case ? project manager: I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . project manager: industrial designer: I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . user interface: But  the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be industrial designer: Spongy also . user interface:  if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to  if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot . user interface: So if we try to push the buttons , it project manager: No the button would be user interface: You think it's possible ? project manager: In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . Button , where do we want some buttons ? user interface: Well , usually hold 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ? industrial designer: Yeah . Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is  yeah also the thumb . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . user interface: This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? project manager: Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . user interface: So if the left , we have the op project manager: I think you can turn it this way also . user interface: Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . project manager: And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . user interface: So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know , but  if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . project manager: So , for interface we said also that we have  this banana shape with button on the s on the side . I think it's  we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah . That is to say ,  check if it fit the the requirement  given by the users , but according to  your presentation it seems to be okay . project manager: So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer  work together . project manager: You feel  free to express what you want to say ? You don't feel too constrained ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: user interface: Maybe you can make    project manager: Okay , so user interface: okay "

        "Query": "What is the final conclusion on the discussion about the criteria of ease of use, learnability, and intuitiveness when evaluating the product?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager and Industrial Designer had a discussion about the second layer of the remote, with the Project Manager expressing concerns about its complexity, but the Industrial Designer reassured that users wouldn't need to pay much attention to it. The group unanimously agreed that the scroll wheel was superior to average remotes, giving it a score of two on this criterion. They also agreed that the remote scored highly in terms of locatability, initially assuming it would be intuitive. However, the Industrial Designer mentioned that it might take some time for people to get used to the scroll wheel as it was a new technology. The Marketing team believed that its usage was obvious. As a result, the group decided to give an average score of five for this criterion.",
        "Article": "The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . project manager:  then industrial designer: project manager: then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . user interface: project manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .  and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .  and then we  will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . S marketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ? industrial designer: project manager: 'Cause we missed out . project manager: So industrial designer: project manager: it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen . How how much do we have , forty minutes ? project manager: Is that right ? user interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . Do you want user interface: So , you said  are are we starting with the the project manager: Yes . user interface: so will you maybe start with like the  the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th  things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and industrial designer: Okay . project manager: user interface: marketing: You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? project manager: industrial designer:  marketing: It's a bit  phallic . project manager: Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? industrial designer:  so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . project manager: And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that user interface:  yeah . marketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? user interface: Yeah , . user interface: yeah , but  one thing we actually kind of  forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: so we said the back side round , yeah . marketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . project manager: user interface: So so  the user interface as as we discussed last time   on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . user interface: So we have that n  channels here starting from   one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . user interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . It's it's quite standard  place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . user interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . user interface: And and we would also have a l little  thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . user interface: On the side , marketing: Ah , you did get that in then , user interface: this one . user interface: And and and it's it's on the back is  cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . user interface: See ? So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen project manager: Yeah . user interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen  the middle button . project manager: Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you marketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . industrial designer:  on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . user interface: Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? project manager: But if you hold it in , industrial designer:  . marketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? project manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? marketing: Okay , cool . user interface: So I think it project manager: And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . user interface: Yeah , I think  we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: project manager:  it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . project manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but  we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country industrial designer: project manager: and cut some of the prices that way . marketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .  you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . Is that right ? marketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . marketing: Well , I thought we'd  kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? project manager: Yeah , just prepare one now . What do you all say ? industrial designer: So ? project manager: I reckon it user interface: S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? marketing: Yeah . Okay   what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . project manager:  we can if we industrial designer: I can I can take note   marketing: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . marketing: Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? project manager: Yeah . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? industrial designer:  the the only thing that we were considering was that  this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , project manager: I think it does .  industrial designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left  scrolling with your finger . user interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a  another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . project manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . industrial designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem , marketing: I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen . user interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so they just marketing: Yeah , but  because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , because  anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , marketing: Yeah . user interface: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's  project manager: marketing: So  that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . marketing: So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? project manager:  marketing: What do you what do you all think ? industrial designer:  . user interface: Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , project manager: Yeah , I think I think for  user interface:  . project manager:  most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to  user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , project manager: They industrial designer: so it opens on the side . industrial designer: So you guys can decide wh whether user interface: it will be and it will be it won't be heavy . user interface: Yeah well yeah , project manager: The length is gonna be difficu user interface: but it's it's a bit long . marketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? industrial designer:  this this kind of  makes it more project manager:  . marketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? industrial designer: No , we have a locator . project manager: No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot . Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , user interface:  that you stick on T_V_ . user interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to  to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . If   if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things project manager: Yeah . user interface: and it's I th I think it's project manager: I'd say six , 'cause the  the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . marketing: Yeah , and  d industrial designer: And  even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology project manager: So industrial designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni project manager: Might be industrial designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but  it's a good technology ,  once they get used to it . project manager: But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . marketing: So , should we maybe say f a five industrial designer: So l marketing: and say it is intuitive , project manager: Five ? marketing: but it's different , so , do you know ,  it's obvious how to use it , project manager: Yeah . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ?  intuitive but Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . marketing: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? project manager: marketing:  okay , cool , E_ , okay .  I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . user interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , so it's kinda industrial designer: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . marketing: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , project manager: Well we've banned them from marketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , project manager: industrial designer:  yeah . industrial designer: And moreover it it has  L_C_D_ and everything , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just project manager: Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . industrial designer: Anyway it ha yeah , user interface: Technologi well industrial designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . Well  we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new . marketing: Yeah , but  you don't project manager: All of the components have been used in other things before . marketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . project manager: What do you reckon , five , six ? marketing: Yeah , what do you all think ? user interface: Six . marketing: Six ? user interface:  how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: Well , that's it ,  user interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , but  everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? project manager: marketing: So , I don't think many peop project manager: Space remote . user interface: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? project manager: industrial designer: The carrot banana remote . marketing: So , we give it seven , and we write user interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . user interface: What's the assessment ? marketing: So , we need the average here , so we got user interface: The average is about six and something . marketing: So we've got four sevens , user interface: No , wait , a little bit under six . project manager: Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . project manager: Six point point industrial designer: Fifty one divided by user interface: Six point something , yeah . project manager: Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . marketing: project manager: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? marketing:  no , that's it , project manager: That's it ? marketing: yeah . marketing: user interface: project manager: Computer no signal ? industrial designer:  I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . project manager: It could be marketing: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . project manager: it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . user interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , project manager: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . project manager: We we're definitely going to have to user interface: We have pushbuttons , industrial designer:  . project manager: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've user interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well . project manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? industrial designer: No  we we have  yeah . user interface: Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel project manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though , user interface: Okay , let's yeah . project manager: marketing: haven't we ? project manager: I think the pushbutton oh . marketing: 'Cause then you have project manager: I don't know if that's one marketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . industrial designer: Huh ? project manager: Push what  industrial designer: Wh wh what is the limit ?  . project manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we user interface: We have to count all of them , or yeah . industrial designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface , marketing: Well it doesn't , but it  project manager: No . industrial designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . marketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? industrial designer:  and the locator also goes away . marketing:  does project manager: What else does it need ? user interface: Well the speaker  the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . project manager: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . project manager: Yeah , okay , so we industrial designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . marketing: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause project manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . We could do industrial designer: So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in  in the L_C_D_ ? user interface: Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . industrial designer: If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . user interface: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton  we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . industrial designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ project manager: That's with the L_C_ industrial designer: That comes with the L_C_D_ ? marketing: Yeah . marketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether project manager: It's nothing n marketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . project manager: Yeah , marketing:  the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but project manager: I have industrial designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . marketing: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ? industrial designer: project manager: Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . project manager: and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , industrial designer: We have , yeah . industrial designer: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . marketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , industrial designer:  yeah . marketing: and the scroll wheel is  essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think . user interface: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . industrial designer: project manager: Tha user interface: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the industrial designer: marketing: Oh the the beeper thing . project manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh .  we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went ,  so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . project manager: Feedback ? Ideas ? user interface: Yeah  , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . industrial designer: I think  n one thing that was lacking  was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . marketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . project manager: But in terms of the process of  going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . marketing: so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s project manager: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah , project manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office . industrial designer: that's it's it's project manager: They great ? industrial designer: I wonder what one of these costs . project manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went ? marketing: I don't think you should say that was the recording . project manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , marketing: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the marketing: Yeah . marketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . We could make some little user interface: But yeah , but  already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . marketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? industrial designer: project manager: And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well . project manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? user interface: To express them   industrial designer:  . user interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and project manager: Yeah . marketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it . user interface: Yeah , neither neither do I , project manager: user interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . marketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , project manager: Banana remote . Vibrate user interface: marketing: Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . project manager: well within budget , including a little what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? user interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . industrial designer: I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and  yeah . project manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . industrial designer: We certainly are , project manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . marketing: project manager: It was very productive day and marketing: We could draw animals on the board again . industrial designer: user interface: Oh , you don't like anim marketing: It's just minging . project manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . industrial designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ? project manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not . project manager:  presumably I have to marketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? project manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really <doc-sep>user interface: Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to  de  design the inside as well . project manager: Okay , just user interface: Yeah , just  we have to design the inside then , but it should be  industrial designer: Yeah , and Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know . project manager: Okay , so that's  I'll just have a look how much that is . industrial designer: The project manager: But  Okay , for the user interface: Advanced chip was for  spee Yeah . marketing: Means industrial designer: So you hold it like this in your right hand and project manager:  . user interface:  so I've industrial designer: Yeah , maybe maybe  you have to configure it . user interface: Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . user interface: That's  industrial designer: Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . user interface: We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . marketing: user interface: So  the best place , the best reach place  on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will  will show up .  y you need to have more  one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . user interface: Okay yeah , they marketing: But you missed the no  the zero and  the two stripes . user interface: And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it . project manager: And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? user interface: So when you pre Yeah . project manager: How do you want to implement that ? Just on the Maybe on the second level as well ? user interface: We're going to implement . industrial designer: All the non-basic are in project manager: Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .  marketing: Okay , there is one  function I use  daily , and it's not on the basic functions . industrial designer: Okay , maybe we use this button for the marketing: That function must be Yeah , maybe Or you can  i  lay it  beneath in the  other  functions . project manager: Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . industrial designer: Like a a new blank one or Or just here ? project manager: No no , just on Down there . marketing: And h how does the second level come out ? project manager: Just  if you s marketing:  it slides  along ? user interface:  slides I think . user interface: You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . marketing: Scart ? user interface: I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit  channels . user interface: So you have one left for the Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . user interface: project manager: You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ? user interface: That was it . What else ? user interface:  ? industrial designer: What else ? user interface: What else ?  menu buttons with arrows . project manager: user interface: Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . marketing:  and and you can hold it , project manager: marketing: you can hold it , and then the colours switch or  multiple multiple buttons . That's   industrial designer: So did we miss anything ? user interface: Yeah , maybe some  some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume . marketing: Yeah , but project manager: No , ma on on o on the on the user interface: I just  The volume logo . marketing: there's one there's one text button I industrial designer: Oh wh Here ? project manager: Yeah . That's the one  that you use if you search for a page ,  like seven hundred ,  and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . marketing: Did you think of that ? industrial designer: Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then user interface:  why not ? project manager: Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well . And if you press it again , you get the the the user interface: I think  marketing: The sta the state you project manager: Oh just three stages , you industrial designer: through view . industrial designer: Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? project manager: Yes , that's to remember . project manager: Yeah , but that's that's  marketing: But maybe it's not the way user interface: I dunno if project manager: That's a functionality for the television . industrial designer: Yeah  nee  No , if i  the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . industrial designer: Th i project manager: That's what what happening if you do it like that . So that's it ? project manager: Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ? marketing: Yeah , I I thought about one thing . marketing: Because  if you use it a couple of years , some  sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are  And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? user interface: I think just on the buttons . industrial designer:  I think just  user interface: If you do it abo above or below , it takes  more space .  well I looked in the reports  from the marketing strategy , or  of  the the the the the the new needs and  the market . We sh we we we can give it  a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our project manager: Okay . marketing: Yeah , the the the difference be between  beautiful and fancy  look-and-feel is  the the the outside  beautiful  like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the   f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . user interface: If it's really  , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think . project manager: But  marketing: And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours  were you thought  of ? industrial designer: Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste . user interface:  ? marketing: The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? user interface:  basic colours , marketing: Or you haven't thought about user interface:  yeah . marketing: Ho how do we make  user interface: Maybe  company colours ? project manager: It's black . marketing: Can project manager: Do we have yellow light ? No , not really , but it's possible . project manager: It's marketing: Black white , maybe ? user interface: Like white , also ni or  always nice . industrial designer: And what colours should the buttons be ? marketing:  Because  project manager: Yeah , different colours . industrial designer: But can you change those too , with  the switch ? project manager: No , no . marketing: Okay , so what  number do we give  a beautiful ? Beautiful is  really subjective ,  because it has to do lots with the colours . user interface: Well we have changeable fronts , so marketing: Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . marketing: So industrial designer: Are w are we changing  Or are they there  backlights on the slide panel too ? Or n no back light ? marketing: Slide panel ? industrial designer: Yeah ? project manager: No . industrial designer: And and the switch channel is  There is a back light too ? project manager: That as well , yeah . That's that's really fancy , but I don't know if it's reachable . industrial designer: And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . user interface: Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so marketing: So I'll give it a project manager: Ye marketing: Yeah , and you can  also choose your light , so project manager: Yeah , this It is a one . project manager: This is a difficult one , because we we don't Yeah , we don't know it about the marketing: Learnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it But  project manager:  it's it's very easy to use , but  the second layer is not easy to use . project manager: It's That's industrial designer: No , but you don't have to use that . industrial designer: That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . user interface: So I think it's easy to use , but And learnable is a bit marketing: Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual   remote control . marketing: Because because I think I think the scroll wheel ,  it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . user interface: Well y just  f marketing: I think  you must  seek for it , and up or down or project manager: But the rest of it is very easy , marketing:  then the re project manager: because there are so so n user interface: Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does . user interface: But the second parts ,  like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . project manager: So it is learnable  f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . user interface: It's Yeah it's marketing: But project manager: And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used  a different kind of  of  device . But we we've got the two so two  two or three  new things , huh ? user interface: Device . project manager: Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , marketing: I I think it a three or something . Learnable's project manager: No , but definitely better , much better than  than  than avera average , yeah . industrial designer: And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know user interface: Yep , true . project manager:  I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . user interface: But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? industrial designer: project manager: Yeah . marketing: Is that new ? project manager: Yeah for a  for a f marketing: The lighting's new . user interface: Different colours , so marketing: Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too . marketing: So we have a pretty new  project manager: There are no games on it , that's that's It's not a one , it's a two again . user interface: That would And we didn't  marketing: It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something . project manager: If you have user interface: We are forgetting about that now , but project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but user interface: But that's more like  now . project manager: If you Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project  map ? user interface:  Just save , save as ? project manager: Yeah . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one .  we are the targeted audience ? Do we like it ? marketing: No , we we we searched for   a young group , audience , beneath f forty . Yeah , but did we reach ,  with our  style , the targeted audience ? project manager: I think so , yeah . project manager: So you want industrial designer: We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . marketing:  the only point is that we don't  have   That's that's That's this question . user interface: You can different front  marketing:  yeah , th So we had we  have  a fruit  project manager: So industrial designer: Like a a f banana kind of front . marketing: That's  project manager: It's marketing: What's the average ? industrial designer: Eleven divided by six . project manager: Oh yeah , that's still user interface:  marketing: Call industrial designer: Yeah , but  we have to make a speaker then too . marketing: That's Yeah , but it industrial designer: But we can we can do it  underneath the logo . user interface: Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , okay . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . industrial designer: But  is   project manager: So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . industrial designer: But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or project manager: No , that's not on the list . industrial designer: Can we make that for  h twenty cents ? user interface: Yeah , we can  marketing: project manager: Probably . I just The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure . So industrial designer: Yeah m If we got a high mark for   innovativeness or innovativity project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the leadership Was there a leadership and user interface: Of course there was . industrial designer: project manager: What do you have to say about that ? industrial designer: No , I think marketing: Who was the leader ? project manager: I dunno . industrial designer: Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just project manager: We're not finished . user interface: And  I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting . project manager: And so you've industrial designer: Yeah , and p just point with a mouse . user interface: Oh industrial designer: What's that ? marketing: For for for project manager: I don't know what it mean . Just user interface: I just think if we  marketing: To gather , or to  work together ,  or new ideas for project manager: For remote control probably . industrial designer: Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . industrial designer: Yeah , but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think . Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the industrial designer: Yeah , just brainstorming basically . Do we  I thought we were done at four o'clock ? industrial designer: It's now quarter past three . user interface: This is industrial designer: We're probably not supposed to look at this , but user interface: The old versions . marketing: What's this ? A bomb or not a bo user interface: No no , the upper one is the bomb . industrial designer: And what else do we have ? user interface: Stupid , the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: 'Kay wait , I'm going to draw something and you must y industrial designer: user interface: What ? Okay , I'm going to guess what you're drawing . project manager: You have to save everything , you know that , huh ? user interface: No , not everything . user interface: I think I know what you're trying to draw , but it's wrong already . F user interface: No , you're wrong , you're wrong marketing: A little bit maybe , but user interface: See where you're wrong now ? The entrance . But but but I think this part user interface: Yeah , but I think marketing: user interface: Oh no you made another mistake "

        "Query": "What were the professor's thoughts on latencies, VAD latency, and the breakdown of latency?",
        "Summary": "The professor expressed satisfaction with the improved model, attributing it to lower latencies. He believed that the effort put into developing a good Voice Activity Detection (VAD) was worthwhile. In order to determine the latency added by the VAD, the professor suggested running the process in parallel. Additionally, the professor informed the team that the maximum latency was still unknown. PhD C provided an explanation of the delays caused by various factors, including a 100ms delay from silence probabilities, a 40ms delay from delta at the input, and a 10ms delay from LDA filters. The professor criticized the insistence on using a flawed system and emphasized the need for straightforward solutions. He emphasized the importance of keeping the lag short for the task at hand.",
        "Article": "professor b: U u u u  , I meant , you know , this end of the world , yeah , is really what I meant , phd c: Oh . phd c: I did some experim  , just a few more experiments before I had to , go away for the w well , that week . professor b: Great ! phd c: Was it last week or whenever ?  , so what I was started playing with was the th again , this is the HTK back - end . And , I was curious because the way that they train up the models , they go through about four sort of rounds of of training . And in the first round they do  , I think it 's three iterations , and for the last three rounds e e they do seven iterations of re - estimation in each of those three . And so , you know , that 's part of what takes so long to train the the the back - end for this . It 's this program called H E professor b: But in HTK , what 's the difference between , a an inner loop and an outer loop in these iterations ? phd c: OK . So what happens is , at each one of these points , you increase the number of Gaussians in the model . phd c: And so , in the final one here , you end up with ,  for all of the the digit words , you end up with , three mixtures per state , professor b: Yeah . So I had done some experiments where I was I I want to play with the number of mixtures . phd c: But , I wanted to first test to see if we actually need to do this many iterations early on . phd c: And so , I I ran a couple of experiments where I reduced that to l to be three , two , two , five , I think , and I got almost the exact same results . So , I I think m it only took something like , three or four hours to do the full training , professor b: As opposed to ? phd f: Good . phd c: as opposed to wh what , sixteen hours or something like that ?  , it takes you have to do an overnight basically , the way it is set up now . phd c: So , even we don't do anything else , doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster . professor b: And then when you have your final thing , do a full one , so it 's phd c: And when you have your final thing , we go back to this .  , it 's like one little text file you edit and change those numbers , and you don't do anything else . phd c: So it 's a very simple change to make and it doesn't seem to hurt all that much . phd a: So you you run with three , two , two , five ? That 's a phd c: So I  , I I have to look to see what the exact numbers were . phd c: I I thought was , like , three , two , two , five , phd a:   Oh , the other thing that I did was , I compiled the HTK stuff for the Linux boxes . So , you can now run your experiments on that machine and you can run five at a time and it runs , as fast as , you know , five different machines . phd c: So , I 've forgotten now what the name of that machine is but I can I can send email around about it . phd c: And so we 've got it now HTK 's compiled for both the Linux and for , the Sparcs .  , you have to make you have to make sure that in your dot CSHRC , it detects whether you 're running on the Linux or a a Sparc and points to the right executables .  , and you may not have had that in your dot CSHRC before , if you were always just running the Sparc . phd c: I can I can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work . phd c: So , together with the fact that we 've got these faster Linux boxes and that it takes less time to do these , we should be able to crank through a lot more experiments . phd c: So after I did that , then what I wanted to do was try increasing the number of mixtures , just to see ,  see how how that affects performance . In fact , you could do something like keep exactly the same procedure and then add a fifth thing onto it phd c:   grad e: So at at the middle o where the arrows are showing , that 's you 're adding one more mixture per state , phd c:  - huh . It goes from this  , try to go it backwards this at this point it 's two mixtures per state . And I think what happens here is professor b: Might be between , shared ,  shared variances or something , phd c: Yeah . phd c: there because they start off with , an initial model which is just this global model , and then they split it to the individuals . I don't know yet the what happened Tuesday , but the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , things like the weights ,  professor b: Oh , this is a conference call for , Aurora participant sort of thing . professor b: Do you know who was who was since we weren't in on it , do you know who was in from OGI ? Was was was Hynek involved or was it Sunil phd a: I have no idea . professor b: or ? phd a: Mmm , I just professor b: Oh , you don't know . So the points were the the weights how to weight the different error rates that are obtained from different language and and conditions . phd a: Some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on  well , to to combine error rates before computing improvement .  , and the fact is that for right now for the English , they have weights they they combine error rates , but for the other languages they combine improvement . And right now actually there is a thing also , that happens with the current weight is that a very non - significant improvement on the well - matched case result in huge differences in in the final number . phd c: How should that be done ?  , it it seems like there 's a simple way phd a:   phd c: Th - they 're professor b: But the but , the other thing phd a: In professor b: I don't know I haven't thought it through , but one one would think that each It it 's like if you say what 's the what 's the best way to do an average , an arithmetic average or a geometric average ? phd c:   professor b: So phd c: Well , it seems like they should do , like , the percentage improvement or something , rather than the absolute improvement . But the question is , do you average the relative improvements or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ? phd a: Yeah . professor b: And the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings . And so when you average the the relative improvement it tends to to give a lot of of , importance to the well - matched case because the baseline is already very good and , i it 's phd c: Why don't they not look at improvements but just look at your av your scores ? You know , figure out how to combine the scores phd a:   phd c: with a weight or whatever , and then give you a score here 's your score . professor b: Well , that 's what he 's seeing as one of the things they could do . professor b: It 's just when you when you get all done , I think that they pro I m I I wasn't there but I think they started off this process with the notion that you should be significantly better than the previous standard . professor b: And , so they said \" how much is significantly better ? what do you ? \" And and so they said \" well , you know , you should have half the errors , \" or something , \" that you had before \" . professor b: i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first and then do the phd a: Combine error rates and then professor b: Yeah . When when you combine error rate it tends to give more importance to the difficult cases , and some people think that professor b: Oh , yeah ? phd a: well , they have different , opinions about this . Some people think that it 's more important to look at to have ten percent imp relative improvement on well - matched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched , and other people think that it 's more important to improve a lot on the mismatch and So , bu phd c: It sounds like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is gonna be . professor b: Well , you know , the the thing is that if you look at the numbers on the on the more difficult cases , if you really believe that was gonna be the predominant use , none of this would be good enough . professor b: whereas you sort of with some reasonable error recovery could imagine in the better cases that these these systems working . So , I think the hope would be that it would  , it would work well for the good cases and , it would have reasonable reas soft degradation as you got to worse and worse conditions . I I guess what I 'm  , I I was thinking about it in terms of , if I were building the final product and I was gonna test to see which front - end I 'd I wanted to use , I would try to weight things depending on the exact environment that I was gonna be using the system in . professor b: I th phd c: So if if they don't know , doesn't that suggest the way for them to go ?  , you assume everything 's equal .  , y y  , you professor b: Well , I I think one thing to do is to just not rely on a single number to maybe have two or three numbers , phd c: Yeah . professor b: and and and say here 's how much you ,  you improve the ,  the the relatively clean case and here 's or or well - matched case , and here 's how here 's how much you , phd c:   professor b: So , I guess what you would do in practice is you 'd try to get as many , examples of similar sort of stuff as you could , and then , phd c: Yeah . professor b:  So the argument for that being the the the more important thing , is that you 're gonna try and do that , but you wanna see how badly it deviates from that when when when the ,  it 's a little different . phd c: So professor b: phd c: so you should weight those other conditions v very you know , really small . That 's a that 's a that 's an arg phd c: that 's more of an information kind of thing . professor b: that 's an ar Well , that 's an argument for it , but let me give you the opposite argument . professor b: are you gonna have w  , examples with the windows open , half open , full open ? Going seventy , sixty , fifty , forty miles an hour ? On what kind of roads ? phd c:   professor b: I I I think that you could make the opposite argument that the well - matched case is a fantasy . professor b: I think the thing is is that if you look at the well - matched case versus the po you know , the the medium and the and the fo and then the mismatched case , we 're seeing really , really big differences in performance . You wouldn't like that as soon as you step outside You know , a lot of the the cases it 's is phd c: Well , that 'll teach them to roll their window up . professor b: in these cases , if you go from the the , I don't remember the numbers right off , but if you if you go from the well - matched case to the medium , it 's not an enormous difference in the in the the training - testing situation , and and and it 's a really big performance drop . professor b: You know , so ,  Yeah ,  the reference one , for instance this is back old on ,  on Italian  , was like six percent error for the well - matched and eighteen for the medium - matched and sixty for the for highly - mismatched .  , and , you know , with these other systems we we helped it out quite a bit , but still there 's there 's something like a factor of two or something between well - matched and medium - matched . And so I think that if what you 're if the goal of this is to come up with robust features , it does mean So you could argue , in fact , that the well - matched is something you shouldn't be looking at at all , that that the goal is to come up with features that will still give you reasonable performance , you know , with again gentle degregra degradation , even though the the testing condition is not the same as the training . professor b: So , you know , I I could argue strongly that something like the medium mismatch , which is you know not compl pathological but  , what was the the medium - mismatch condition again ? phd a: it 's Yeah . Medium mismatch is everything with the far microphone , but trained on , like , low noisy condition , like low speed and or stopped car and tested on high - speed conditions , I think , like on a highway and professor b: Right . phd a: So professor b: So it 's still the same same microphone in both cases , phd a: Same microphone but Yeah . But the way they have it now , it 's I guess it 's it 's They they compute the relative improvement first and then average that with a weighting ? phd a: Yeah . professor b: so , u i since they have these three categories , it seems like the reasonable thing to do is to go across the languages and to come up with an improvement for each of those . professor b: Just say \" OK , in the in the highly - matched case this is what happens , in the m the ,  this other m medium if this happens , in the highly - mismatched that happens \" . professor b: I think that that I I I gather that in these meetings it 's it 's really tricky to make anything ac make any policy change because everybody has has , their own opinion phd a:   Yeah , but there is probably a a big change that will be made is that the the baseline th they want to have a new baseline , perhaps , which is , MFCC but with a voice activity detector . So they want to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline , but w which would be a much better baseline . phd a: And if we look at the result that Sunil sent , just putting the VAD in the baseline improved , like , more than twenty percent , professor b:   phd a: which would mean then then mean that fifty percent on this new baseline is like , well , more than sixty percent improvement on on o e e  professor b: So nobody would be there , probably . professor b: So whose VAD is Is is this a ? phd a: they didn't decide yet . I guess i this was one point of the conference call also , but mmm , so I don't know .  , it 's not that the design of the VAD isn't important , but it 's just that it it it does seem to be i  , a lot of work to do a good job on on that and as well as being a lot of work to do a good job on the feature design , phd a: Yeah . Per - e s s someone told that perhaps it 's not fair to do that because the ,  to make a good VAD you don't have enough to with the the features that are the baseline features . phd c: Wha - what do you mean ? phd a: Yeah , if i professor b: So y so you m s Yeah , but Well , let 's say for ins see , MFCC for instance doesn't have anything in it , related to the pitch . So suppose you 've that what you really wanna do is put a good pitch detector on there and if it gets an unambiguous phd c: Oh , oh . professor b: if it gets an unambiguous result then you 're definitely in a in a in a voice in a , s region with speech . phd c: So there 's this assumption that the v the voice activity detector can only use the MFCC ? phd a: That 's not clear , but this e professor b: Well , for the baseline . professor b: So so if you use other features then y But it 's just a question of what is your baseline . Right ? What is it that you 're supposed to do better than ? phd c: I g Yeah . professor b: And so having the baseline be the MFCC 's means that people could choose to pour their ener their effort into trying to do a really good VAD phd c: I don't s But they seem like two separate issues . phd c: Right ?  professor b: Unfortunately there 's coupling between them , which is part of what I think Stephane is getting to , is that you can choose your features in such a way as to improve the VAD . professor b: You should do both phd c: Right ? professor b: and and I I think that this still makes I still think this makes sense as a baseline . professor b: you know , we had the MFCC 's before , lots of people have done voice activity detectors , phd a:   professor b: you might as well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline , just like you picked some version of HTK and made that the baseline .  , and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features be better features for the VAD then that 's so be it . professor b: But , at least you have a starting point that 's  , cuz i i some of the some of the people didn't have a VAD at all , I guess . professor b: then they they looked pretty bad and and in fact what they were doing wasn't so bad at all . And if it turns out that you can't improve on that , well , then , you know , nobody wins and you just use MFCC .  , it seems like , it should include sort of the current state of the art that you want are trying to improve , and MFCC 's , you know , or PLP or something it seems like reasonable baseline for the features , and anybody doing this task , is gonna have some sort of voice activity detection at some level , in some way . They might use the whole recognizer to do it but rather than a separate thing , but but they 'll have it on some level . phd c: It seems like whatever they choose they shouldn't , you know , purposefully brain - damage a part of the system to make a worse baseline , or professor b: Well , I think people just had phd c: You know ? professor b: it wasn't that they purposely brain - damaged it . professor b: And and then when the the the proposals actually came in and half of them had V A Ds and half of them didn't , and the half that did did well and the half that didn't did poorly . So what happened since , last week is well , from OGI , these experiments on putting VAD on the baseline . And these experiments also are using , some kind of noise compensation , so spectral subtraction , and putting on - line normalization , just after this . So I think spectral subtraction , LDA filtering , and on - line normalization , so which is similar to the pro proposal - one , but with spectral subtraction in addition , and it seems that on - line normalization doesn't help further when you have spectral subtraction . phd c: Is this related to the issue that you brought up a couple of meetings ago with the the musical tones phd a: I phd c: and ? phd a: I have no idea , because the issue I brought up was with a very simple spectral subtraction approach , phd c: Mmm . phd a: and the one that they use at OGI is one from from the proposed the the the Aurora prop  , proposals , which might be much better . And what 's happened here is that we so we have this kind of new , reference system which use a nice a a clean downsampling - upsampling , which use a new filter that 's much shorter and which also cuts the frequency below sixty - four hertz , professor b: Right . professor b: When you say \" we have that \" , does Sunil have it now , too , phd a: I No .  , it seems to improve on the well - matched case , but it 's a little bit worse on the mismatch and highly - mismatched  when we put the neural network . And with the current weighting I think it 's sh it will be better because the well - matched case is better . professor b: But how much worse since the weighting might change how how much worse is it on the other conditions , when you say it 's a little worse ? phd a: It 's like , fff , fff  , ten percent relative . That 's phd a:  - y w when I say it 's worse , it 's not it 's when I I  , compare proposal - two to proposal - one , so , r  , y putting neural network compared to n not having any neural network . phd a: because it has  , this sixty - four hertz cut - off , clean downsampling , and ,  what else ?  , yeah , a good VAD . I I j  ,  pr professor b: But the latencies but you 've got the latency shorter now . phd f: Isn't it phd a: And so professor b: So it 's better than the system that we had before . phd a: And then I took this system and , mmm , w  , I p we put the old filters also . So we have this good system , with good VAD , with the short filter and with the long filter , and , with the short filter it 's not worse .  professor b: But what you 're saying is that when you do these So let me try to understand . professor b: that , on the i things are somewhat better , in proposal - two for the well - matched case and somewhat worse for the other two cases . professor b: So does ,  when you say ,  So The th now that these other things are in there , is it the case maybe that the additions of proposal - two over proposal - one are less im important ? phd a: Yeah . Then we tried , to do something like proposal - two but having , e using also MSG features . So basically we try to , find good features that could be used for voicing detection , but it 's still ,  on the ,  t phd f: Oh , well , I have the picture . phd a: we w basically we are still playing with Matlab to to look at at what happened , phd c: What sorts of phd f: Yeah . phd a: and phd c: what sorts of features are you looking at ? phd f: We have some phd a: So we would be looking at , the variance of the spectrum of the excitation , phd f: this , this , and this . So the So basically the spectrum of the excitation for a purely periodic sig signal shou sh professor b: OK . Yeah , w what yo what you 're calling the excitation , as I recall , is you 're subtracting the the ,  the mel mel mel filter , spectrum from the FFT spectrum . phd a: So we have the mel f filter bank , we have the FFT , so we just professor b: So it 's it 's not really an excitation , phd a: No . phd f: We have here some histogram , phd a: E yeah , phd f: but they have a lot of overlap . So , well , for unvoiced portion we have something tha that has a mean around O point three , and for voiced portion the mean is O point fifty - nine . phd c: How did you get your voiced and unvoiced truth data ? phd a: We used , TIMIT and we used canonical mappings between the phones phd f: Yeah . We , use TIMIT on this , phd a: and phd f: for phd a: th Yeah . phd f: But if we look at it in one sentence , it apparently it 's good , I think . phd a: It seems quite robust to noise , so when we take we draw its parameters across time for a clean sentence and then nois the same noisy sentence , it 's very close . There could be also the ,  something like the maximum of the auto - correlation function or which phd c: Is this a a s a trained system ? Or is it a system where you just pick some thresholds ? Ho - how does it work ? phd a: Right now we just are trying to find some features . Hopefully , I think what we want to have is to put these features in s some kind of ,  well , to to obtain a statistical model on these features and to or just to use a neural network and hopefully these features w would help phd c: Because it seems like what you said about the mean of the the voiced and the unvoiced that seemed pretty encouraging . phd c: Well , y I I don't know that I would trust that so much because you 're doing these canonical mappings from TIMIT labellings . phd c: Right ? So , really that 's sort of a cartoon picture about what 's voiced and unvoiced . phd c: i it it may be that that you 're finding something good and that the variance is sort of artificial because of how you 're getting your truth . But another way of looking at it might be that  , what w we we are coming up with feature sets after all . So another way of looking at it is that  , the mel cepstru mel spectrum , mel cepstrum , any of these variants , give you the smooth spectrum . By going back to the FFT , you 're getting something that is more like the raw data . So the question is , what characterization and you 're playing around with this another way of looking at it is what characterization of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you 're missing that could help ? So , looking at different statistical measures of that difference , coming up with some things and just trying them out and seeing if you add them onto the feature vector does that make things better or worse in noise , where you 're really just i i the way I 'm looking at it is not so much you 're trying to f find the best the world 's best voiced - unvoiced , classifier , phd c:   professor b: but it 's more that , you know , try some different statistical characterizations of that difference back to the raw data phd c: Right . The the more obvious is that that well , using the th the FFT , you just it gives you just information about if it 's voiced or not voiced , ma mainly ,  . phd a: this is why we we started to look by having sort of voiced phonemes professor b: Well , that 's the rea w w what I 'm arguing is that 's Yeah . professor b: But in in reality , it 's you know , there 's all of this this overlap and so forth , grad e: Oh , sorry . professor b: and But what I 'm saying is that may be OK , because what you 're really getting is not actually voiced versus unvoiced , both for the fac the reason of the overlap and and then , th you know , structural reasons , like the one that Chuck said , that that in fact , well , the data itself is that you 're working with is not perfect . professor b: So , what I 'm saying is maybe that 's not a killer because you 're just getting some characterization , one that 's driven by your intuition about voiced - unvoiced certainly , phd a:   professor b: but it 's just some characterization of something back in the in the in the almost raw data , rather than the smooth version . professor b: And your intuition is driving you towards particular kinds of , statistical characterizations of , what 's missing from the spectral envelope . professor b: obviously you have something about the excitation , and what is it about the excitation , and , you know and you 're not getting the excitation anyway , you know . So so I I would almost take a  , especially if if these trainings and so forth are faster , I would almost just take a  , a scattershot at a few different ways of look of characterizing that difference and , you could have one of them but and and see , you know , which of them helps . phd c: So i is the idea that you 're going to take whatever features you develop and and just add them onto the future vector ? Or , what 's the use of the the voiced - unvoiced detector ? phd a: I guess we don't know exactly yet . Th phd c: It 's not part of a VAD system that you 're doing ? phd f: No . phd a:  Yeah , it could be ,  it could be a neural network that does voiced and unvoiced detection , phd c:   professor b: But each one of the mixture components  , you have , variance only , so it 's kind of like you 're just multiplying together these , probabilities from the individual features within each mixture . So it 's so , it seems l you know phd c: I think it 's a neat thing .  , I know that , people doing some robustness things a ways back were were just doing just being gross and just throwing in the FFT and actually it wasn't wasn't wasn't so bad .  , so it would s and and you know that i it 's gotta hurt you a little bit to not have a a spectral ,  a s a smooth spectral envelope , so there must be something else that you get in return for that phd a:   phd c: So how does  , maybe I 'm going in too much detail , but how exactly do you make the difference between the FFT and the smoothed spectral envelope ? Wha - wh i i  , how is that ,  ? phd a: we just How did we do it up again ? phd f: we distend the we have the twenty - three coefficient af after the mel f filter , phd a:   phd f: And i the interpolation i between the point is give for the triang triangular filter , the value of the triangular filter and of this way we obtained this mode this model speech . phd a: S professor b: So you essentially take the values that th that you get from the triangular filter and extend them to sor sort of like a rectangle , that 's at that m value . phd a: So we have we have one point for one energy for each filter bank , phd f: mmm Yeah , it 's linear . phd a: which is the energy that 's centered on on on the triangle phd f: Yeah . At the n at the center of the filter phd c: So you you end up with a vector that 's the same length as the FFT vector ? phd a: Yeah . And I think the variance is computed only from , like , two hundred hertz to one to fifteen hundred . phd a: Above ,  it seems that Well , some voiced sound can have also , like , a noisy part on high frequencies , and But professor b: Yeah . phd a: Well , it 's just professor b: No , it 's makes sense to look at low frequencies . phd c: So this is  , basically this is comparing an original version of the signal to a smoothed version of the same signal ? phd f: Yeah . So i so i i this is  , i you could argue about whether it should be linear interpolation or or or or zeroeth order , but but phd c:  - huh . professor b: at any rate something like this is what you 're feeding your recognizer , typically .  , so the mel cepstrum is the is the is the cepstrum of this this , spectrum or log spectrum , phd a: So this is Yeah . professor b: whatever it You - you 're subtracting in in in power domain or log domain ? phd a: In log domain . But , anyway ,  and that 's phd c: So what 's th  , what 's the intuition behind this kind of a thing ? I I don't know really know the signal - processing well enough to understand what what is that doing . What happen if what we have have what we would like to have is some spectrum of the excitation signal , professor b: Yeah . phd a: And the way to do this is that well , we have the we have the FFT because it 's computed in in the in the system , and we have the mel filter banks , phd c:   phd a: and so if we if we , like , remove the mel filter bank from the FFT , we have something that 's close to the excitation signal . phd a: It 's something that 's like a a a train of p a pulse train for voiced sound phd c: OK . So do you have a picture that sh ? phd a: So - It 's Y phd c: Is this for a voiced segment , phd a: yeah . phd c: this picture ? What does it look like for unvoiced ? phd f: Yeah . This is phd f: but between the frequency that we are considered for the excitation phd a: Right . phd c: So , does does the periodicity of this signal say something about the the phd f: Fifteen p phd a: So it 's Yeah . professor b: to first order what you 'd what you 're doing  , ignore all the details and all the ways which is that these are complete lies .  , the the you know , what you 're doing in feature extraction for speech recognition is you have , in your head a a a a simplified production model for speech , phd c:   professor b: in which you have a periodic or aperiodic source that 's driving some filters . phd a: Do you have the mean do you have the mean for the auto - correlation ? professor b: first order for speech recognition , you say \" I don't care about the source \" . professor b: The filters roughly act like a ,  a ,  a an overall resonant you know , f some resonances and so forth that th that 's processing excitation . professor b: So if you look at the spectral envelope , just the very smooth properties of it , you get something closer to that . professor b: And the notion is if you have the full spectrum , with all the little nitty - gritty details , that that has the effect of both , phd c: Yeah . professor b: And so this is saying , well , if you really do have that sort of vocal tract envelope , and you subtract that off , what you get is the excitation . And I call that lies because you don't really have that , you just have some kind of signal - processing trickery to get something that 's kind of smooth . professor b: That 's why I was going to the why I was referring to it in a more a more , conservative way , when I was saying \" well , it 's yeah , it 's the excitation \" . This moved in the professor b: So so , stand standing back from that , you sort of say there 's this very detailed representation . professor b: but whenever you smooth you lose something , so the question is have you lost something you can you use ? phd c: Right . professor b: probably you wouldn't want to go to the extreme of just ta saying \" OK , our feature set will be the FFT \" , cuz we really think we do gain something in robustness from going to something smoother , but maybe there 's something that we missed . professor b: And then you go back to the intuition that , well , you don't really get the excitation , but you get something related to it . professor b: And it and as you can see from those pictures , you do get something that shows some periodicity , in frequency , phd c:   professor b: so , phd c: So you don't have one for unvoiced picture ? phd f: not here . professor b: But presumably you 'll see something that won't have this kind of , regularity in frequency , in the phd a: But Yeah . phd c: And so you said this is pretty doing this kind of thing is pretty robust to noise ? phd a: It seems , yeah . The mean is different with it , because the the histogram for the the classifica phd a: No , no , no . But th the kind of robustness to noise phd f: Oh ! phd a: So if if you take this frame , from the noisy utterance and the same frame from the clean utterance phd f:  . Cool ! phd f: I have here the same frame for the clean speech phd c: Oh , that 's clean . phd f: the same cle phd c: Oh , OK phd f: But they are a difference . phd a: Yeah , that 's phd f: Because here the FFT is only with two hundred fifty - six point phd c: Oh . phd a: because if we use the standard , frame length of of , like , twenty - five milliseconds , what happens is that for low - pitched voiced , because of the frame length , y you don't really have you don't clearly see this periodic structure , professor b:   phd a: Yeah , but it 's the same frame and phd c: Oh , it 's that time - frequency trade - off thing . Well ,  it looks better , but , the thing is if if ,  if you 're actually asking you know , if you actually j  , need to do place along an FFT , it may be it may be pushing things . professor b: And and ,  phd c: Would you would you wanna do this kind of , difference thing after you do spectral subtraction ? phd a: maybe . The spectral subtraction is being done at what level ? Is it being done at the level of FFT bins or at the level of , mel spectrum or something ? phd a: I guess it depends . professor b: how are they doing it ? phd a: How they 're doing it ? Yeah . Filter bank , phd a: no ? It 's on the filter bank , phd f: yeah . So we 'll perhaps try to convince OGI people to use the new the new filters and Yeah .  , has has anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard , source , phd a: not yet professor b: or ? phd a: but I wi I will call them and professor b: OK . phd a: now they are I think they have more time because they have this well , Eurospeech deadline is over phd c: When is the next , Aurora deadline ? phd a: and It 's , in June . professor b: Early June , late June , middle June ? phd a: I don't know w professor b:  .  , and he 's been doing all the talking but but these he 's he 's ,  phd f: Yeah .  , but has he pretty much been talking about what you 're doing also , and ? phd f: Oh , I I am doing this . I 'm sorry , but I think that for the recognizer for the meeting recorder that it 's better that I don't speak . phd f: Because professor b: You know , we 'll get we 'll get to , Spanish voices sometime , and we do we want to recognize , you too . phd f: After the after , the result for the TI - digits on the meeting record there will be foreigns people . phd c: Y professor b: We like we we 're we 're w we are we 're in the , Bourlard - Hermansky - Morgan , frame of mind . So it 's  , anything to talk about ? grad d: N  , not not not much is new . So when I talked about what I 'm planning to do last time , I said I was , going to use Avendano 's method of , using a transformation , to map from long analysis frames which are used for removing reverberation to short analysis frames for feature calculation .  , but , I decided not to do that after all because I I realized to use it I 'd need to have these short analysis frames get plugged directly into the feature computation somehow professor b:   grad d: and right now I think our feature computation is set to up to , take , audio as input , in general . So I decided that I I 'll do the reverberation removal on the long analysis windows and then just re - synthesize audio and then send that . Right ? grad d: or or even if I 'm using our system , I was thinking it might be easier to just re - synthesize the audio , professor b: Yeah ? grad d: because then I could just feacalc as is and I wouldn't have to change the code .  , longer - term if it 's if it turns out to be useful , one one might want to do something else , grad d: Right . professor b: but  , in in other words , you you may be putting other kinds of errors in from the re - synthesis process . But anyway it sounds like a reasonable way to go for a for an initial thing , and we can look at at exactly what you end up doing and and then figure out if there 's some something that could be be hurt by the end part of the process . So that 's That was it , huh ? grad d: That Yeah , e That 's it , that 's it . I went off on a little tangent this past week , looking at , modulation s spectrum stuff , and and learning a bit about what what ,  what it is , and , the importance of it in speech recognition . And I found some some , neat papers , historical papers from , Kanedera , Hermansky , and Arai . grad e: And they they did a lot of experiments where th where , they take speech and , e they modify the ,  they they they measure the relative importance of having different , portions of the modulation spectrum intact . grad e: And they find that the the spectrum between one and sixteen hertz in the modulation is ,  is im important for speech recognition . professor b: And and , the the MSG features were sort of built up with this notion grad e: Yeah . professor b: But , I guess , I thought you had brought this up in the context of , targets somehow . professor b: But i m grad e:  professor b: i it 's not  , they 're sort of not in the same kind of category as , say , a phonetic target or a syllabic target grad e: Mmm . professor b: or a grad e: I was thinking more like using them as as the inputs to to the detectors . professor b: So maybe , le phd c: Should we do digits ? professor b: let 's do digits <doc-sep> , I can say about just q just quickly to get through it , that Dave and I submitted this ASRU .  , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , and , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well .  , and when they had the reverberation here , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio and it 's , about nine DB . professor b: phd a: You mean , from the actual , recordings ? professor b: a fair amount of phd d: k phd a: It 's nine DB ? professor b: Yeah .  , I know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the Mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at ,  at OGI .  , but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , the the Aurora HTK system baseline system and the system that we were the the  , other system we were using , the  , the SRI system , was that the SRI system had maybe a , hundred hertz high - pass . professor b: For some reason , Dave thought it was twenty , phd d:  So the , center would be somewhere around like hundred professor b: but . professor b: But do you know , for instance , h how far down it would be at twenty hertz ? What the how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz , let 's say ? phd d: At twenty hertz . professor b: Yeah , any idea what the curve looks like ? phd d: Twenty hertz frequency Oh , it 's it 's zero at twenty hertz , right ? The filter ? phd c: Yea - actually , the left edge of the first filter is at sixty - four . professor b: It 's actually set to zero ? What kind of filter is that ? phd c: Yeah . professor b: Is this oh , from the from phd c: It This is the filter bank in the frequency domain that starts at sixty - four . professor b: Oh , so you ,  so you really set it to zero , the FFT ? phd d: Yeah , phd c: Yeah . So I wonder , is it @ @ Was there their experimentation with , say , throwing away that filter or something ? And ,  phd d: throwing away the first ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: Right , but the question is , whether sixty - four hertz is is , too , low . phd d: I t I think I 've tried a hundred and it was more or less the same , or slightly worse . professor b: On what test set ? phd d: On the same , SpeechDat - Car , Aurora . professor b: phd d: So it was professor b: and on and on the , TI - digits also ? phd d: No , no , no . That 'd be something to look at sometime because what , eh , he was looking at was performance in this room . professor b: Would that be more like Well , you 'd think that 'd be more like SpeechDat - Car , I guess , in terms of the noise .  , the signal - to - noise ratio , you know , looks a fair amount better if you if you high - pass filter it from this room . professor b: So , the main the the phd a: So that 's on th that 's on the f the far field ones though , right ? Yeah . phd a: So wha what is ,  what 's causing that ? professor b: Well , we got a a video projector in here , and ,  which we keep on during every every session we record , phd a: Yeah . professor b: which , you know , I I w we were aware of phd a:  - huh . professor b: But but ,  So , those are those are major components , I think , phd a: I see . professor b: but , it ,  I guess , I maybe I said this last week too but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise . And , so I think when when he gets done with his prelim study I think one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , noise , processing stuff and and , synthesize some speech from it . phd a: When are his prelims ? professor b: And then  , I think in about , a little less than two weeks .  , let 's see , this is the sixteenth , seventeenth ? Yeah , I don't know if he 's before It might even be in a week . I I guessed that they were gonna do it some time during the semester professor b: week and a half . phd a: but they 'll do it any time , huh ? professor b: They seem to be Well , the semester actually is starting up . phd a: Is it already ? professor b: Yeah , the semester 's late late August they start here .  , that that was sort of one  , the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set . And But if you had a a really big training set , a recognizer , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set I thought that One thing with the HTK is that is has the as we 're using the configuration we 're using is w s is being bound by the terms of Aurora , we have all those parameters just set as they are . So even if we had a hundred times as much data , we wouldn't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many Gaussians or anything .  , so , that ,  that seemed to be So , if you have that that better recognizer that can that can build up more parameters , and if you , have the natural room , which in this case has a p a pretty bad signal - to - noise ratio , then in that case , the right thing to do is just do u use speaker adaptation . But I think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise - processing as well as , the convolutional kind of things we were doing . phd d: That sample was released only yesterday or the day before , right ? phd a: No Well , I haven't grabbed that one yet . phd d: Oh , there is another short sample set phd a: There was another short one , yeah . phd a: And so I haven't grabbed the latest one that he just , put out yet . professor b: Is there any word yet about the issues about , adjustments for different feature sets or anything ? phd a: No , I I d You asked me to write to him and I think I forgot to ask him about that . phd d: Cuz they have it phd a: Maybe I 'll send it to the list . phd d: Cuz they have , already frozen those in i insertion penalties and all those stuff is what I feel . phd d: And , on that , they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those phd a: And so they 've picked the values . professor b: For r w what test set ? phd d: p the one that they have reported is a NIST evaluation , Wall Street Journal . professor b: But that has nothing to do with what we 're testing on , right ? phd c:   So they 're , like  So they are actually trying to , fix that those values using the clean , training part of the Wall Street Journal . phd d: they want to train it and then this they 're going to run some evaluations . professor b: So they 're set they 're setting it based on that ? phd d: Yeah . So now , we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we can't modify these parameters . professor b:  but it 's still worth , I think , just since you know , just chatting with Joe about the issue . Do you think that 's something I should just send to him professor b:  phd a: or do you think I should send it to this there 's an a m a mailing list .  , we 're , you know , certainly willing to talk about it with everybody , but I think I think that , it 's probably best to start talking with him just to phd a: OK . professor b:  @ @ you know , it 's a dialogue between two of you about what you know , what does he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it . professor b: if you get ten people in involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how phd a: Yeah . professor b: but if if if there is any , way to move in a way that would that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features . But if if ,  if there isn't , and it 's just kind of shut down and and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in . phd d: Because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for Linux and all those . phd d: SUSI phd a: Yeah , SUSI or whatever it was phd d: yeah . professor b: but , I noticed , just glancing at the , Hopkins workshop , web site that ,  one of the thing I don't know Well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a , tool kit for doing ,  r  , arbitrary graphical models for , speech recognition . professor b: So And Jeff ,  the two Jeffs were phd a: Who 's the second Jeff ? professor b:  Oh , do you know Geoff Zweig ? phd a: No . professor b: so he did he did his PHD on dynamic Bayes - nets , for for speech recognition . He had some continuity built into the model , presumably to handle some , inertia in the in the production system , and ,  phd a:  .  , so it 's exactly the same approach , but the features that the VAD neural network use are , MFCC after noise compensation . professor b: What was it using before ? phd c: Before it was just P L phd d:  phd c: So . phd c: Yeah , phd d: Yeah , yeah , yeah , phd c: noisy noisy features . phd c:  This is what we get after This So , actually , we , yeah , here the features are noise compensated and there is also the LDA filter .  , and then it 's a pretty small neural network which use , nine frames of of six features from C - zero to C - fives , plus the first derivatives . phd a: Is that nine frames u s  , centered around the current frame ? Or phd c: Yeah . professor b: S so , I 'm I 'm sorry , there 's there 's there 's how many how many inputs ? phd c: So it 's twelve times nine . So I guess about eleven thousand parameters , which actually shouldn't be a problem , even in in small phones . phd a: So , I 'm I 'm s so what is different between this and and what you phd c: It should be OK . So the previous syst It 's based on the system that has a fifty - three point sixty - six percent improvement . The only thing that changed is the n a p eh a es the estimation of the silence probabilities . phd c:  So it 's it 's not bad , but the problem is still that the latency is too large . professor b: What 's the latency ? phd c: Because  the the latency of the VAD is two hundred and twenty milliseconds . And , the VAD is used  , i for on - line normalization , and it 's used before the delta computation . So if you add these components it goes t to a hundred and seventy , right ? professor b: I I 'm confused . You started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy ? phd c: With two an two hundred and seventy . phd c: If Yeah , if you add the c delta comp delta computation professor b: Oh . I the is this are these twenty - millisecond frames ? Is that why ? Is it after downsampling ? or phd c: The two - twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the  No , it 's forty milliseconds for t for the , cleaning of the speech . phd c: Yeah , and there is the delta at the input which is , professor b: One hundred milliseconds for smoothing . phd c:  phd d: It 's like forty plus forty plus professor b: And then forty phd c: Mmm . phd c: Yeah , there are twenty that comes from There is ten that comes from the LDA filters also . phd d: If you are using professor b:  phd c: Plus the frame , phd d: t If you are using three frames phd c: so it 's two - twenty . phd d: If you are phrasing f using three frames , it is thirty here for delta . So it 's like s five , six cepstrum plus delta at nine nine frames of professor b: And then ten milliseconds for phd d: Fi - There 's an LDA filter . professor b: ten milliseconds for LDA filter , and t and ten another ten milliseconds you said for the frame ? phd c: For the frame I guess . I computed two - twenty Yeah , well , it 's I guess it 's for the fr the professor b: OK . And then there 's delta besides that ? phd c: So this is the features that are used by our network and then afterwards , you have to compute the delta on the , main feature stream , professor b: OK . phd c: which is  , delta and double - deltas , which is fifty milliseconds . No , the after the noise part , the forty the the other hundred and eighty Well , Wait a minute . Some of this is ,  is ,  is in parallel , isn't it ?  , the LDA Oh , you have the LDA as part of the V D -  , VAD ? Or phd c: The VAD use , LDA filtered features also . professor b: so the delta at the end is how much ? phd c: It 's fifty . So phd c: But well , we could probably put the delta , before on - line normalization . It should not that make a big difference , phd a: What if you used a smaller window for the delta ? phd c: because phd a: Could that help a little bit ?  , I guess there 's a lot of things you could do to phd c: Yeah . phd c: Yeah , professor b: So phd c: but , nnn professor b: Yeah . So if you if you put the delta before the , ana on - line If Yeah phd c:   phd c: Cuz i professor b: And then y then you don't have that additive phd c: Yeah , phd d: Yep . phd c: cuz the time constant of the on - line normalization is pretty long compared to the delta window , professor b: OK . And you ought to be able to shove tw ,  sh  pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred , right ?  phd a: Is two hundred the d professor b: The hundred milla phd c:   It could be eighty and and probably do @ @ phd c: Yeah , phd a: i a hun phd c: yeah . phd a:  Wh - what 's the baseline you need to be under ? Two hundred ? professor b: Well , we don't know . professor b: if it 's two if if it 's ,  if it 's two - fifty , then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty . If it 's two hundred , if we shaved off twenty , we could we could , meet it by moving the delta back . phd a: So , how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding ? professor b: we don't , but it 's just  , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it . professor b: And so , th  , if if if a week before we have to be done someone says , \" Well , you have to have fifty milliseconds less than you have now \" , it would be pretty frantic around here . professor b:  phd a: But still , that 's that 's a pretty big , win . And it doesn't seem like you 're in terms of your delay , you 're , that professor b: He added a bit on , I guess , because before we were we were had were able to have the noise , stuff , and the LVA be in parallel . phd c: Well , but I think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . phd d: Yeah , the LDA LDA we don't know , is , like is it very crucial for the features , right ? phd c: No . professor b: so you could start pulling back , phd d: S s h professor b: but phd d: Yeah , professor b: But I think you have phd d: l professor b: you have twenty for delta computation which y now you 're sort of doing twice , right ? But yo w were you doing that before ? phd c: Mmm . Well , in the proposal , the input of the VAD network were just three frames , I think . professor b: So , what you have now is fort  , forty for the the noise , twenty for the delta , and ten for the LDA . That 's seventy milliseconds of stuff which was formerly in parallel , phd c:  professor b: right ? So I think , phd c:   professor b: you know , that 's that 's the difference as far as the timing , right ? phd c: Yeah . professor b: and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit , but  , we 're s we 're not we 're not in terrible shape . professor b: It 's it 's not like it 's adding up to four hundred milliseconds or something . phd a: Where where is this where is this fifty - seven point O two in in comparison to the last evaluation ? professor b: Well , it 's I think it 's better than anything , anybody got . Yeah , and r and phd c: It would phd d: Yeah , so this is this is like the first proposal .  , I 'm sure other people working on this are not sitting still either , but phd a: Yeah . professor b: but but , the important thing is that we learn how to do this better , and , you know . So , our ,  Yeah , you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on SpeechDat - Car which is a hard task , cuz it 's really ,  I think it 's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be . Yeah , even for a well - matched case it 's sixty percent error rate reduction , professor b: Yeah . So actually , this is in between what we had with the previous VAD and what Sunil did with an IDL VAD . Which gave sixty - two percent improvement , right ? phd d: Yeah , it 's almost that . phd a: What was that ? Say that last part again ? phd c: So , if you use , like , an IDL VAD , for dropping the frames , phd d: o o Or the best we can get . phd c: the best that we can get i That means that we estimate the silence probability on the clean version of the utterances . phd a: So that would be even That wouldn't change this number down here to sixty - two ? phd c: Yeah . So you you were get phd c: If you add a g good v very good VAD , that works as well as a VAD working on clean speech , phd a: Yeah . phd c: then you wou you would go phd a: So that 's sort of the best you could hope for . professor b: And ,  and sixty - two with the the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating VAD . phd c: yeah , the next thing is , I started to play Well , I don't want to worry too much about the delay , no . And the other stream is the output of a neural network , using as input , also , these , cleaned MFCC .  phd a: Those are th those are th what is going into the tandem net ? phd c: I don't have the comp Mmm ? phd a: Those two ? phd c: So there is just this feature stream , the fifteen MFCC plus delta and double - delta . phd a: Yeah ? phd c: so it 's makes forty - five features that are used as input to the HTK . professor b: cuz then it has one part that 's discriminative , phd c: Yeah . Right now it seems that i I just tested on SpeechDat - Car while the experiment are running on your on TI - digits . Well , it improves on the well - matched and the mismatched conditions , but it get worse on the highly mismatched .  , professor b: y phd c: like , on the well - match and medium mismatch , the gain is around five percent relative , but it goes down a lot more , like fifteen percent on the HM case . professor b: You 're just using the full ninety features ? phd c:  The professor b: Y you have ninety features ? phd c: i I have ,  From the networks , it 's twenty - eight . It 's i i i It 's because it 's what we did for the first proposal . phd c: But we have to for sure , we have to go down , because the limit is now sixty features .  phd a: So , it seems funny that I don't know , maybe I don't u quite understand everything , but that adding features I guess I guess if you 're keeping the back - end fixed . But I guess if you 're keeping the number of Gaussians fixed in the recognizer , then professor b: Well , yeah . professor b: But , just in general , adding information Suppose the information you added , well , was a really terrible feature and all it brought in was noise . professor b: Right ? So so ,  Or or suppose it wasn't completely terrible , but it was completely equivalent to another one feature that you had , except it was noisier . professor b: Right ? In that case you wouldn't necessarily expect it to be better at all . I 'm just surprised that you 're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel professor b:  - huh . professor b: So , \" highly mismatched condition \" means that in fact your training is a bad estimate of your test . professor b: So having having , a g a l a greater number of features , if they aren't maybe the right features that you use , certainly can e can easily , make things worse . If you have if you have , lots and lots of data , and you have and your your your training is representative of your test , then getting more sources of information should just help . professor b: So I wonder , Well , what 's your what 's your thought about what to do next with it ? phd c: I don't know . I 'm surprised , because I expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch , as it was the case for the professor b:   phd c: Yeah , it 's the same training set , so it 's TIMIT with the TI - digits ' , noises , added . phd c:  professor b: Well , we might  , we might have to experiment with ,  better training sets . professor b: I The other thing is , before you found that was the best configuration , but you might have to retest those things now that we have different The rest of it is different , right ? So , For instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ? phd c:   professor b: You don't necessarily know what phd a: What if you did the Would it make sense to do the KLT on the full set of combined features ? Instead of just on the phd c: Yeah . The reason I did it this ways is that in February , it we we tested different things like that , so , having two KLT , having just a KLT for a network , or having a global KLT . phd c: And phd a: So you tried the global KLT before phd c: Well phd a: and it didn't really phd c: Yeah . phd c: The differences between these configurations were not huge , but it was marginally better with this configuration . professor b: And I guess if the These are all so all of these seventy - three features are going into , the ,  the  . professor b: And is are i i are are any deltas being computed of tha of them ? phd c: Of the straight features , yeah . phd c: So , yeah , maybe we can add some context from these features also as Dan did in in his last work . i Yeah , but the other thing I was thinking was , now I lost track of what I was thinking . phd a: What is the You said there was a limit of sixty features or something ? phd c:   phd a: What 's the relation between that limit and the , forty - eight  , forty eight hundred bits per second ? professor b: Oh , I know what I was gonna say . phd a: So I I I don't understand , phd c: The f the forty - eight hundred bits is for transmission of some features . phd a: because i  , if you 're only using h phd c: And generally , i it s allows you to transmit like , fifteen , cepstrum . professor b: The issue was that , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gonna be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth . What I was going to say is that , maybe maybe with the noise removal , these things are now more correlated . So you have two sets of things that are kind of uncorrelated , within themselves , but they 're pretty correlated with one another . professor b: And , they 're being fed into these , variants , only Gaussians and so forth , and and , phd c:   professor b: so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , have , one KLT over everything , to de - correlate it . phd d: What are the S N Rs in the training set , TIMIT ? phd c: It 's , ranging from zero to clean ? Yeah . So we found this this ,  this Macrophone data , and so forth , that we were using for these other experiments , to be pretty good . professor b: So that 's i after you explore these other alternatives , that might be another way to start looking , is is just improving the training set . professor b: we were getting , lots better recognition using that , than Of course , you do have the problem that , u i we are not able to increase the number of Gaussians , or anything to , to match anything . So we 're only improving the training of our feature set , but that 's still probably something . phd a: So you 're saying , add the Macrophone data to the training of the neural net ? The tandem net ? professor b: Yeah , that 's the only place that we can train . professor b: We can't train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount , phd a: Right .  ,  phd a: What what was it trained on again ? The one that you used ? phd c: It 's TIMIT with noise . phd c: So , yeah , it 's rather a small professor b: How big is the net , by the way ? phd c: it 's , five hundred hidden units . And professor b: And again , you did experiments back then where you made it bigger and it and that was that was sort of the threshold point . @ @ ? phd d: So is it is it though the performance , big relation in the high ma high mismatch has something to do with the , cleaning up that you that is done on the TIMIT after adding noise ? phd c:  phd d: So it 's i All the noises are from the TI - digits , phd c: Yeah . phd d: right ? So you i phd c:  They k  phd d: Well , it it 's like the high mismatch of the SpeechDat - Car after cleaning up , maybe having more noise than the the training set of TIMIT after clean s after you do the noise clean - up . phd d: So it had like all these different conditions of S N Rs , actually in their training set of neural net . phd d: But after cleaning up you have now a different set of S N Rs , right ? phd c: Yeah . phd d: And is it something to do with the mismatch that that 's created after the cleaning up , like the high mismatch phd c: You mean the the most noisy occurrences on SpeechDat - Car might be a lot more noisy than phd d:   professor b: but , you 're saying Yeah , the noisier ones are still going to be , even after our noise compensation , are still gonna be pretty noisy . phd d: Yeah , so now the after - noise compensation the neural net is seeing a different set of S N Rs than that was originally there in the training set . phd d: And that SNR may not be , like , com covering the whole set of S N Rs that you 're getting in the SpeechDat - Car . professor b: Right , but the SpeechDat - Car data that you 're seeing is also reduced in noise by the noise compensation . phd c: Well , if the initial range of SNR is different , we the problem was already there before . phd c: Because Mmm professor b: Yeah , it depends on whether you believe that the noise compensation is equally reducing the noise on the test set and the training set .  professor b: Right ?  , you 're saying there 's a mismatch in noise that wasn't there before , phd d:  . professor b: but if they were both the same before , then if they were both reduic reduced equally , then , there would not be a mismatch . professor b: So , this may be Heaven forbid , this noise compensation process may be imperfect , but . I I just that could be seen from the TI - digits , testing condition because , the noises are from the TI - digits , right ? Noise phd c: Yeah . So phd d: So cleaning up the TI - digits and if the performance goes down in the TI - digits mismatch high mismatch like this phd c: Clean training , yeah . professor b: the Macrophone data , I think , you know , it was recorded over many different telephones . I don't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car , but I think it 's it 's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments , and playing around with it doesn't , make it better , the most  , it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set .   , what we were  the condition It it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with Meeting Recorder digits , even though there , again , these m Macrophone digits were very , very different from , what we were going on here . But it was just I think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing . phd c: Yeah , actually to s eh , what I observed in the HM case is that the number of deletion dramatically increases . phd c: When I added the num the neural network it doubles the number of deletions . Yeah , so I don't you know how to interpret that , but , mmm professor b: Yeah . phd c: t phd a: And and did an other numbers stay the same ? Insertion substitutions stay the same ? phd c: They p stayed the same , phd a: Roughly ? phd c: they maybe they are a little bit  , lower . But professor b: Did they increase the number of deletions even for the cases that got better ? phd c:   professor b: And it Remind me again , the \" highly mismatched \" means that the phd c: Clean training and professor b: sorry ? phd c: It 's clean training Well , close microphone training and distant microphone , high speed , I think . professor b: Close mike training phd c: Well The most noisy cases are the distant microphone for testing . phd c: The feature are the same except that professor b: that 's right , that 's right .  phd a: Well that that says that , you know , the ,  the models in in , the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features . professor b: But , yeah , actually the TIMIT noises are sort of a range of noises and they 're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises , right ? It 's it 's pretty different . \" phd c: \" Subway \" , right ? and phd d: \" Street \" or \" Airport \" or something . phd c: So it 's mostly Well , \" Car \" is stationary , professor b:   phd c: \" Babble \" , it 's a stationary background plus some voices , professor b:   professor b: Well , I I think that if you run it Actually , you maybe you remember this . When you in in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , with the the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ? phd c:   professor b: Was it about the same ?  , w i phd c: It was b a little bit worse . professor b: So , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net wasn't helping at all . as soon as we added LDA on - line normalization , and all these things , then professor b: They were doing similar enough things . Well , I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing . phd c: Yeah , professor b: And and the thing I I have in mind is , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . You know ? And ,  But if on the ha other hand , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and and and , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a of a , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow . professor b: If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on on , improving the the net . professor b: So what 's the overall effe  , you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ? But it 's but of course that one 's weighted lower , phd c: Y yeah , oh . That 's not that bad , but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car . phd d: Well , it will overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse , because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five point two five eight . So the so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four , phd d: Is it like professor b: and and , in fact since the others are somewhat better phd d: Yeah , so it 's four . Is i So either it 'll get cancelled out , or you 'll get , like , almost the same . phd a: In the ,  a lot of the ,  the Hub - five systems , recently have been using LDA . So there 's the the LDA is is right there before the H M phd d: Yeah . phd a: So , you guys are using LDA but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . The LDA that you saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , and then do an LDA on it , phd a: Yeah . phd a: it 's you know , you 're just basically i phd d: Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency high cost frequency . So it 's like more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r phd a: Ah . So what i what about ,  i u what i w  , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put ran the other kind of LDA , on your features right before they go into the  ? phd d: it phd c:   phd a: But  , w but the other features that you have , th the non - tandem ones , phd c:  . Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , but phd a:  - huh . professor b: The a the argument i is kind of i in and it 's not like we really know , but the argument anyway is that , we always have the prob  , discriminative things are good . professor b: they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . It PAC - PCA low - order PCA throws away pieces that are  , maybe not not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . professor b: But , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . So you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is is something else . professor b: And so , Stephane 's idea was , let 's feed , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , phd a: Yeah . professor b: and then , you you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that that doesn't have that , phd a:  - huh . And that that seem So it 's kind of like a combination of the  , what , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature  , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . It 's it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these these other things . And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he he when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was was it didn't help at all in this particular case . But by having them both there The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . professor b: And some of the time it 's going to hurt you , phd a: Right . professor b: and by combining two information sources if , you know if if phd a: So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that professor b: That i i I think that 's counter to that idea . But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . professor b: and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA .  , we ,  we were getting ready to do the tandem , stuff for the Hub - five system , and , Andreas and I talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , \" Well , yeah , that i you know th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have  , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . phd a: You know , that you have it without it , then you have the LDA , then you have the neural net , and you can see , theoretically . professor b: or tha that 's a phd a: That 's what that 's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing . phd a: it everybody believes it , professor b: Oh , no it 's a g phd a: but you know , we just professor b: No , no , but it might not not even be true . professor b: it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea .  , one of the things that always disturbed me , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , a lot of people Because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , looking at all into the linear , versions of them . professor b: And , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , and You know , so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it . phd a: Yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their systems now , and so , I that 's what made me wonder about this , professor b: Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , phd a: but . professor b: but but but , phd a: Yeah , what  is it 's it 's like in the Hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , you know , LDA on their features . phd c: It 's the transformation they 're estimating on Well , they are trained on the same data as the final  are . Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that that you guys have . phd a: So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . professor b: part of why I I think part of why you were getting into the KLT Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , you know , getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? So you were just trying I think you r  , this is it doesn't have the LDA aspect but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? phd c:   phd d: So , yeah , I 've been exploring a parallel VAD without neural network with , like , less latency using SNR and energy , after the cleaning up . So what I 'd been trying was ,  After the b after the noise compensation , n I was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean . So that if if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech . And if it is n if it is close to zero , which is So it 's like a scale @ @ probability value . So I was trying , with full band and multiple bands , m ps  separating them to different frequency bands and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them .  , the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can professor b:   phd d: just like Which means that it 's it 's doing a slightly better job than the previous VAD , professor b:   phd d: so ,  professor b: But i d I 'm sorry , phd d: so u professor b: does it still have the median filter stuff ? phd d: It still has the median filter . professor b: So it still has most of the delay , phd d: So professor b: it just doesn't phd d: Yeah , so d with the delay , that 's gone is the input , which is the sixty millisecond . professor b: Well , w i phd d: At the input of the neural net you have this , f nine frames of context plus the delta . phd d: so the delay is only the forty millisecond of the noise cleaning , plus the hundred millisecond smoothing at the output . So the the di the biggest The problem f for me was to find a consistent threshold that works well across the different databases , because I t I try to make it work on tr SpeechDat - Car professor b:   phd d: and it fails on TI - digits , or if I try to make it work on that it 's just the Italian or something , it doesn't work on the Finnish . So there are there was , like , some problem in balancing the deletions and insertions when I try different thresholds . phd d: So The I 'm still trying to make it better by using some other features from the after the p clean up maybe , some , correlation auto - correlation or some s additional features of to mainly the improvement of the VAD . professor b: Now this this this , \" before and after clean \" , it sounds like you think that 's a good feature . That that , it you th think that the ,  the i it appears to be a good feature , right ? phd d:   phd c: Yeah , eventually we could could just phd d: Yeah , so Yeah , so that 's the Yeah . phd d: Because they did that itself phd c: Then you don't have to worry about the thresholds and phd d: There 's a threshold and Yeah . So if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere , then then that would be a , good thing . professor b: anybody has anybody you guys or or Naren , somebody , tried the , second th second stream thing ?  . phd d: Oh , I just I just h put the second stream in place and ,  ran one experiment , but just like just to know that everything is fine . phd d: So it was like , forty - five cepstrum plus twenty - three mel log mel . phd d: And and , just , like , it gave me the baseline performance of the Aurora , which is like zero improvement . phd d: So I just tried it on Italian just to know that everything is But I I didn't export anything out of it because it was , like , a weird feature set . Well , what I think , you know , would be more what you 'd want to do is is is , put it into another neural net . phd d: The  , other thing I was wondering was , if the neural net , has any because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net , where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional some four plus some f few more conditions which it hasn't seen , actually , phd c:   phd d:  instead of just h having c  , those cleaned up t cepstrum , sh should we feed some additional information , like The the We have the VAD flag .  , should we f feed the VAD flag , also , at the input so that it it has some additional discriminating information at the input ? phd c:  -  !  professor b: Wh -  , the the VAD what ? phd d: We have the VAD information also available at the back - end . phd d: So if it is something the neural net is not able to discriminate the classes professor b: Yeah . phd d:  Because most of it is sil  , we have dropped some silence f We have dropped so silence frames ? professor b:   So , by having an additional , feature which says \" this is speech and this is nonspeech \" , it certainly helps in some unseen noise conditions for the neural net . phd a: What Do y do you have that feature available for the test data ? phd d: Well , we have we are transferring the VAD to the back - end feature to the back - end . phd d: Which is which is certainly giving a phd a: So you 're saying , feed that , also , into the neural net . The other thing you could do is just , p modify the , output probabilities of the of the , neural net , tandem neural net , based on the fact that you have a silence probability . professor b: So you have an independent estimator of what the silence probability is , and you could multiply the two things , and renormalize . professor b: But but ,  phd c: Yeah , so maybe , yeah , when phd a: But in principle wouldn't it be better to feed it in ? And let the net do that ? professor b: Well , u Not sure . \" Or you can say , \" It 's silence ! Go away ! \"  , i Doesn't ? I think I think the second one sounds a lot more direct . So , what if you then ,  since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? professor b: Well , phd c: That 's what phd a: Well , I guess that 's the same . professor b: Yeah , y you 'd have to actually run it continuously , phd a: But   , train the net only on professor b: but it 's @ @ Well , no , you want to train on on the nonspeech also , because that 's part of what you 're learning in it , to to to generate , that it 's it has to distinguish between . phd a: But  , if you 're gonna if you 're going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision , would then you don't care about whether the net makes that distinction , right ? professor b: Well , yeah . Now the only thing that that bothers me about all this is that I I I The the fact i i It 's sort of bothersome that you 're getting more deletions . But So I might maybe look at , is it due to the fact that  , the probability of the silence at the output of the network , is , professor b: Is too high . So maybe So phd c: If it 's the case , then multiplying it again by i by something ? phd d: It may not be it professor b: Yeah . phd d: Yeah , it it may be too it 's too high in a sense , like , everything is more like a , flat probability . phd d: So , like , it 's not really doing any distinction between speech and nonspeech phd c: yeah . phd a: Be interesting to look at the Yeah , for the I wonder if you could do this . But if you look at the , highly mism high mismat the output of the net on the high mismatch case and just look at , you know , the distribution versus the the other ones , do you do you see more peaks or something ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: or professor b: But I bu phd c: It it seems that the VAD network doesn't Well , it doesn't drop , too many frames because the dele the number of deletion is reasonable . But it 's just when we add the tandem , the final MLP , and then professor b: Yeah . Now the only problem is you don't want to ta I guess wait for the output of the VAD before you can put something into the other system , phd c: u professor b: cuz that 'll shoot up the latency a lot , right ? Am I missing something here ? phd c: But phd d:   But but I I guess phd a: But if you were gonna put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net , right ? phd d: well . professor b: It 's kind of done in  , some of the things are , not in parallel , but certainly , it would be in parallel with the with a tandem net . So maybe , if that doesn't work ,  But it would be interesting to see if that was the problem , anyway . And and and then I guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you 're feeding into the VAD , and feeding it into the other one as well . professor b:  But that 's Yeah , that 's an interesting thing to try to see , if what 's going on is that in the highly mismatched condition , it 's , causing deletions by having this silence probability up up too high , phd c:   phd c: So , m professor b: Cuz Well , the V A if the VAD said since the VAD is is is right a lot ,  phd c: Yeah . Yeah , and the other thing Well , there are other issues maybe for the tandem , like , well , do we want to , w  n Do we want to work on the targets ? Or , like , instead of using phonemes , using more context dependent units ? phd a: For the tandem net you mean ? phd c: Well , I 'm Yeah . phd c: I 'm thinking , also , a w about Dan 's work where he he trained a network , not on phoneme targets but on the  state targets . professor b: Problem is , if you are going to run this on different m test sets , including large vocabulary , phd c: Yeah . I was just thinking maybe about , like , generalized diphones , and come up with a a reasonable , not too large , set of context dependent units , and and Yeah . But I d I d it it i it 's all worth looking at , phd c:   professor b: but it sounds to me like , looking at the relationship between this and the speech noise stuff is is is probably a key thing . phd a: So if ,  if the , high mismatch case had been more like the , the other two cases in terms of giving you just a better performance , how would this number have changed ? phd c:   If if i phd a: y Like sixty ? professor b: Well , we don't know what 's it 's gonna be the TI - digits yet . If you extrapolate the SpeechDat - Car well - matched and medium - mismatch , it 's around , yeah , maybe five . phd c: Well , it 's around five percent , because it 's s Right ? If everything is five percent . phd c: I d I d I just have the SpeechDat - Car right now , so phd a: Yeah . phd c: It 's running it shou we should have the results today during the afternoon , phd a:  . Well  So I won't be here for phd a: When When do you leave ? professor b: I 'm leaving next Wednesday .  , phd a: But you 're professor b: so I phd a: are you you 're not gonna be around this afternoon ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: This afternoon  Oh , right , for the Meeting meeting ? Yeah , that 's just cuz of something on campus . But , yeah , so next week I won't , and the week after I won't , cuz I 'll be in Finland .  , phd a: What 's September sixth ? professor b: and  , that 's during Eurospeech .  Right ? So it 'll be a few weeks , really , before we have a meeting of the same cast of characters . And and then  , we 'll start up again with Dave and Dave and Barry and Stephane and us on the , twentieth . Thirteenth ? About a month ? phd a: So , you 're gonna be gone for the next three weeks or something ? professor b: I 'm gone for two and a half weeks starting starting next Wed - late next Wednesday . Is that right ? professor b: I won't it 's probably four because of is it three ? Let 's see , twenty - third , thirtieth , sixth . And the the third one won't probably won't be a meeting , cuz cuz , Su - Sunil , Stephane , and I will all not be here . So it 's just , the next two where there will be there , you know , may as well be meetings , phd a: OK . And then starting up on the thirteenth , we 'll have meetings again but we 'll have to do without Sunil here somehow . phd a: When is the evaluation ? November , or something ? professor b: Yeah , it was supposed to be November fifteenth <doc-sep>professor c: OK , what are we talking about today ? phd b: I don't know . phd a: Oh , this was the , talk where they were supposed to try to decide phd b: To to decide what to do , phd a: Ah , right .  , so  , let 's let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead , phd b: Yeah . professor c: because even if they tell us that , the rules are different , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing .  , well , we 've a little bit worked on trying to see , what were the bugs and the problem with the latencies . phd d: To improve phd b: So , We took first we took the LDA filters and , we designed new filters , using  recursive filters actually . professor c: So when you say \" we \" , is that something Sunil is doing or is that ? phd b: I 'm sorry ? professor c: Who is doing that ? phd b: us . phd b: So we took the filters the FIR filters and we designed , IIR filters that have the same frequency response . phd b: So they had two filters , one for the low frequency bands and another for the high frequency bands . And the low frequency band has sixty - four milliseconds of delay , and the high frequency band filter has something like eleven milliseconds compared to the two hundred milliseconds of the IIR filters . So we have the filters but we still have to implement a routine that does recursive filtering professor c: OK . phd b: and professor c: You you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ? phd b: No . professor c: right ? So so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing , phd b: Yeah .  , I yeah , I don't know if th that 's what they were trying to They were trying to do something different like taking ,  well , using filter that takes only a past professor c: Right . I think that the the fact that we we did that with had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication . Well , there is w one , remark about these filters , that they don't have a linear phase . phd b: Well , I don't know , perhaps it perhaps it doesn't hurt because the phase is almost linear but .  , and so , yeah , for the delay I gave you here , it 's it 's , computed on the five hertz modulation frequency , which is the mmm , well , the most important for speech so . professor c: So that would be , a reduction of a hundred and thirty - six milliseconds , phd d: The low f f phd b: Yeah . professor c: which ,  What was the total we ended up with through the whole system ? phd b: Three hundred and thirty . professor c: So that would be within ? phd b: Yeah , but there are other points actually , which will perhaps add some more delay . Is that some other other stuff in the process were perhaps not very  perf well , not very correct , like the downsampling which w was simply dropping frames . phd b: so we will try also to add a nice downsampling having a filter that that professor c:  - huh .  , because wh when when we look at the LDA filters , well , they are basically low - pass but they leave a lot of what 's above twenty - five hertz . phd b: and so , yeah , this will be another filter which would add ten milliseconds again . phd b: yeah , and then there 's a third thing , is that , basically the way on - line normalization was done  , is just using this recursion on on the  , on the feature stream , professor c: Yeah .  , and when we look at this filter actually it has a delay of eighty - five milliseconds . If we want to be very correct , so if we want to the estimation of the mean t t to to be well , the right estimation of the mean , we have to t to take eighty - five milliseconds in the future . We would be at six so , sixty - five , plus ten , plus for the downsampling , plus eighty - five for the on - line normalization . So it 's professor c: phd b: plus plus eighty for the neural net and PCA . phd b: So it would be around two hundred and forty so , well , professor c: Just just barely in there . phd a: What 's the allowable ? professor c: Two - fifty , unless they changed the rules . phd a: What were they thinking of changing it to ? professor c: But phd b: Yeah . professor c: well the people who had very low latency want it to be low  , very very very narrow , latency bound . professor c: Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency , but phd a: Ah ! professor c: But , phd b: Yeah , and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency . professor c: Yeah , so they were basically  , they were more or less trading computation for performance and we were , trading latency for performance . And they were dealing with noise explicitly and we weren't , and so I think of it as complementary , that if we can put the phd a: Think of it as what ? professor c: Complementary . professor c: I think the best systems so , everything that we did in in a way it was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system , which is something actually , we 've done a lot over the last thirteen years . So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise . And , we did this , RASTA - like filtering which was done in the log domain and was tending to handle convolutional noise . So , the , spectral sub subtraction schemes a couple places did seem to seem to do a nice job . And so , we 're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff . I think you should be able to end up with a system that 's better than both but clearly the way that we 're operating for this other stuff does involved some latency to to get rid of most of that latency . To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we 'd have to throw out most of what we 're doing . And and , I don't think there 's any good reason for it in the application actually .  , you 're you 're you 're speaking to a recognizer on a remote server and , having a a a quarter second for some processing to clean it up . professor c: These aren't large vocabulary things so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time , and . phd a: And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency . What what does wa was your experience when you were doing this stuff with , the the the surgical , microscopes and so forth .  , how long was it from when somebody , finished an utterance to when , something started happening ? phd a: we had a silence detector , so we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector . phd a: And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance . phd a: but it was , I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds . phd a: So professor c: Yeah , so you you so you had a phd a: this w professor c: so you had a a quarter second delay before , plus some little processing time , phd a: Right . professor c: And there 's physical inertia there , so probably the the motion itself was all phd a: And it felt to , the users that it was instantaneous . professor c: Yeah , so you would think as long as it 's under half a second or something . A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds , and I 'm not even sure if we can tell the difference between a quarter of a second and half a second .  , basically if you yeah , if you said , \" what 's the ,  what 's the shortest route to the opera ? \" and it took half a second to get back to you , phd a: Yeah . phd a: because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other 's utterances . So like if I 'm asking you a question , you may start answering before I 'm even done . Well , anyway , I think we could cut we know what else , we could cut down on the neural net time by by , playing around a little bit , going more into the past , or something like that . phd a: So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ? professor c:   professor c: And there 's also well , there 's the neural net and there 's also this , multi - frame , KLT . phd a: Wasn't there Was it in the , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all ? professor c: They weren't looking ahead much . And and then But you also could just , we haven't experimented with this but I imagine you could , predict a , a label , from more in the past than in than than in the future . phd a: but I don't think professor c: Yeah , but we 've but we played a little bit with with asymmetric , guys . So , that 's what that 's what you 're busy with , s messing around with this , phd b: yeah . And , phd d: Also we were thinking to to , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson phd b: Yeah . professor c: phd a: What is the advantage of that ? phd d:  phd b: Well , it 's that by the for the moment we have , something that 's discriminant and nonlinear . Well , it 's it 's a linear transformation , that  professor c: So at least just to understand maybe what the difference was between how much you were getting from just putting the frames together and how much you 're getting from the discriminative , what the nonlinearity does for you or doesn't do for you . Actually what we want to do , perhaps it 's to replace to to have something that 's discriminant but linear , also . And to see if it if it improves ov over over the non - discriminant linear transformation . professor c: Yeah , well , that 's what I meant , is to see whether whether it having the neural net really buys you anything . professor c: But maybe it 's just the discrimination and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary . But the other part you were saying was the spectral subtraction , so you just kind of ,  phd b: Yeah . professor c: At what stage do you do that ? Do you you 're doing that ,  ? phd b: So it would be on the  on on the mel frequency bands , phd d: We was think phd b: so . professor c: OK , phd d: Yeah , professor c: so just do that on the mel f phd d: we no nnn We we was thinking to do before after VAD or phd b: Yeah , phd d: Oh , we don't know exactly when it 's better . phd b:  phd d: Before after VAD or professor c: So so you know that that that the way that they 're phd d: and then phd b:  . professor c: one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , run a good VAD , and and determine boundaries . professor c: The reason for that was that ,  if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't , or one had a better VAD than the other since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the the task , and that any any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection . It still wouldn't be perfect but  , e the argument was \" let 's not have that be part of this test . \" And so , I guess they argued about that yesterday and , yeah , I 'm sorry , I don't don't know the answer but we should find out . So ,  Yeah , so there 's the question of the VAD but otherwise it 's it 's on the the ,  the mel fil filter bank , energies I guess ? phd d:   professor c: And you 're you 're subtracting in the in the in the I guess it 's power power domain , or or magnitude domain . phd b: and professor c: if you look at the theory , it 's it should be in the power domain but but , I 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain phd b: Yeah . professor c: I have asked people why and they shrug their shoulders and say , \" oh , it works . professor c: and there 's this I guess there 's this mysterious  people who do this a lot I guess have developed little tricks of the trade .  , there 's there 's this ,  you don't just subtract the the estimate of the noise spectrum . phd b: so you have the estimation of the power spectra of the noise , and you multiply this by a factor which is depend dependent on the SNR . phd a:  ! phd b: When the speech lev when the signal level is more important , compared to this noise level , the coefficient is small , and around one . But when the power le the s signal level is  small compared to the noise level , the coefficient is more important . And this reduce actually the music musical noise , phd a: Oh ! phd b:  which is more important during silence portions , phd a:  - huh . professor c: Well , that 's  , that 's what differs from different different tasks and different s  , spectral subtraction methods . phd a:  ! professor c: if if you have , fair assurance that , the noise is is quite stationary , then the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise , get a much better estimate , and subtract it off . professor c: But if it 's varying at all , which is gonna be the case for almost any real situation , you have to do it on - line , with some forgetting factor or something . phd a: So do you is there some long window that extends into the past over which you calculate the average ? professor c: Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum . So one of the things that , Hans - Guenter Hirsch did ,  and pas and other people actually , he 's he wasn't the only one I guess , was to , take some period of of of speech and in each band , develop a histogram . And , in fact I think the NIST standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this . phd a: A couple seconds ? professor c: So No , no , it 's based on this kind of method , phd a:  . Now , if you have signal and you have noise , you basically have these two bumps in the histogram , which you could approximate as two Gaussians . professor c: So so basically now you have this mixture of two Gaussians , you you n know what they are , and , sorry , you estimate what they are , and , so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum . And the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to , determine through magical means that that , there 's no speech in some period , and then see what the spectrum is .  , a variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio is to just ,  you can do a w a  an iterative thing , EM - like thing , to determine means only . professor c: And then you just use those mean values as being the the ,   signal - to - noise ratio in that band . phd a: But what is the it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency . Cuz if you don't look into the future , right ? phd a: OK , well that I guess that was my question , professor c: if you just yeah phd a: yeah . professor c: if you just if you you ,  a at the beginning you have some phd a: Guess . professor c: esti some guess and and ,  phd b: Yeah , but it professor c: It 's an interesting question . I wonder how they did do it ? phd b: Actually , it 's a mmm If - if you want to have a good estimation on non - stationary noise you have to look in the in the future .  , if you take your window and build your histogram in this window , what you can expect is to have an estimation of th of the noise in in the middle of the window , not at the end . So professor c: Well , yeah , phd b: the but but people professor c: but what does what what what does Alcatel do ? phd d:   grad e: Pretty stationary , phd b: but ,  professor c: Well , the thing , e e e e grad e: yeah . professor c: Yeah , y  , you 're talking about non - stationary noise but I think that spectral subtraction is rarely is is not gonna work really well for for non - stationary noise , phd b: Well , if y if you have a good estimation of the noise , professor c: you know ? phd b: yeah , because well it it has to work . professor c: But it 's hard to phd b: i professor c: but that 's hard to do . So so I think that that what what is wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with r slowly varying or stationary noise . professor c: If it varies a lot , to get a If if to get a good estimate you need a few seconds of speech , even if it 's centered , right ? phd b:   professor c: if you need a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it 's changed a lot in a few seconds , then it , you know , i it 's kind of a problem . professor c: imagine e five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum , phd b: Mmm . So , phd b: So in this case , yeah , sure , you cannot professor c: Yeah . phd b: But I think y  , Hirsch does experiment with windows of like between five hundred milliseconds and one second .  and he worked on non - stationary noises , like noise modulated with well , wi with amplitude modulations and things like that , phd a: Were his , windows centered around the phd b: and But  , yeah . professor c: No , I understand it 's better to do but I just think that that , for real noises wh what what 's most likely to happen is that there 'll be some things that are relatively stationary phd b: Mmm . professor c: and other things where it 's not so stationary and  , you can always pick something that that falls between your methods , phd b:  . professor c: but I don't know if , you know , if sinusoidally , modul amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice . professor c: I think that it 's  phd a: We could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files , and built the averages from them . phd b: What What do you mean ? professor c: Just cheat You 're saying , cheat . phd b: But if the if the noise is stationary perhaps you don't even need some kind of noise estimation algorithm . phd b: We just take th th th the beginning of the utterance and professor c: Oh , yeah , sure . phd b: Well , everybody seems to use some kind of adaptive , well , scheme professor c: But but phd d: Yeah . phd b: is it very useful professor c: you know , stationary phd a: Very slow adaptation . phd b: and is the c phd a: th professor c: Right , the word \" stationary \" is has a very precise statistical meaning . But , you know , in in signal - processing really what we 're talking about I think is things that change slowly , compared with our our processing techniques . professor c: So if you 're driving along in a car I I would think that most of the time the nature of the noise is going to change relatively slowly . If you if you check it out , five minutes later you may be in a different part of the road phd b:   But it 's it 's i i i using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well . professor c: But you could get hurt a lot if you just took some something from the beginning of all the speech , of , you know , an hour of speech and then later phd b: Yeah . professor c: so they may be you know , may be overly , complicated for for this test but but but , I don't know .  , if possible you shouldn't you should you should make it , the center of the center of the window .  , phd a: If they 're going to provide a , voice activity detector that will tell you the boundaries of the speech , then , couldn't you just go outside those boundaries and do your estimate there ? professor c: Oh , yeah . So I I imagine that 's what they 're doing , right ? Is they 're they 're probably looking in nonspeech sections and getting some ,  phd b: Yeah , they have some kind of threshold on on the previous estimate , and So . Yeah , so , they h they have an estimate of the noise level and they put a threshold like six or ten DB above , and what 's under this threshold is used to update the estimate . It 's like saying what 's under the threshold is silence , professor c: Does France Telecom do this phd b: and grad e:  . professor c: Does France Telecom do th do the same thing ? More or less ? phd b: I d I Y you know , perhaps ? phd d: No .  , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly , just , things that that we 've been chatting about but haven't made it into these meetings yet . So you 're coming up with your quals proposal , and ,  Wanna just give a two three minute summary of what you 're planning on doing ? grad e: Oh , two , three , it can be shorter than that .  , but I 'm , looking into extending the work done by Larry Saul and John Allen and  Mazin Rahim .  , they they have a system that 's , a multi - band , system but their multi - band is is a little different than the way that we 've been doing multi - band in the past , where  Where we 've been @ @  taking  sub - band features and i training up these neural nets and on on phonetic targets , and then combining them some somehow down the line , they 're they 're taking sub - band features and , training up a detector that detects for , these phonetic features for example , he presents  , a detector to detect sonorance . And so what what it basically is is ,  it 's there 's at the lowest level , there it 's it 's an OR ga  , it 's an AND gate . So , on each sub - band you have several independent tests , to test whether  , there 's the existence of sonorance in a sub - band . And at the at the higher level , for every if ,  The higher level there 's a soft OR gate .  , so if if this detector detects  , the presence of of sonorance in any of the sub - bands , then the detect  , the OR gate at the top says , \" OK , well this frame has evidence of sonorance . \" phd a: What are what are some of the low level detectors that they use ? grad e: And these are all Oh , OK .  , and the ,  professor c: So that , by the way , basically is a is one of the units in our in our our neural network . Yeah , so he uses , an EM algorithm to to  train up these  parameters for the logistic regression . professor c: Well , actually , yeah , grad e: The professor c: so I was using EM to get the targets . So so you have this this this AND gate what we were calling an AND gate , but it 's a product product rule thing at the output . And then he uses , i u and then feeding into that are I 'm sorry , there 's it 's an OR at the output , isn't it ? Yeah , grad e:   phd a: And so are each of these , low level detectors are they ,  are these something that you decide ahead of time , like \" I 'm going to look for this particular feature or I 'm going to look at this frequency , \" or What what what are they looking at ? grad e:  phd a: What are their inputs ? grad e:  Right , so the OK , so at each for each sub - band there are basically , several measures of SNR and and correlation .  , and for for every s every sub - band , e you you just pick ahead of time , \" I 'm going to have like five i independent logistic tests . grad e: And you initialize these parameters , in some some way and use EM to come up with your training targets for a for the the low - level detectors . grad e: And then , once you get that done , you you you train the whole whole thing on maximum likelihood .  , and h he shows that using this this method to detect sonorance is it 's very robust compared to ,  to typical , full - band Gaussian mixtures  estimations of of sonorance . You get enough of these detectors together , then you have enough information to do , higher level discrimination , for example , discriminating between phones phd a:   grad e: and then you keep working your way up until you you build a full recognizer . grad e: So , that 's that 's the direction which I 'm I 'm thinking about going in my quals .  , one is the going towards , using narrow band information for , ph phonetic features of some sort rather than just , immediately going for the the typical sound units . professor c: Another thing I like about it is that you t this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for a product of errors rule , which is what , Allen keeps pointing out that Fletcher observed in the twenties , phd a:   And then , the third thing I like about it is , and we 've played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit but it hasn't been our dominant way of of operating anything , this issue of where the targets come from . So in our case when we 've been training it multi - band things , the way we get the targets for the individual bands is , that we get the phonetic label for the sound there phd a:   professor c: and we say , \" OK , we train every \" What this is saying is , OK , that 's maybe what our ultimate goal is or not ultimate but penultimate goal is getting these these small sound units . But but , along the way how much should we , what should we be training these intermediate things for ?  , because , we don't know  , that this is a particularly good feature .  , there 's no way ,  someone in the audience yesterday was asking , \" well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not ? \" phd a:   professor c: But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide , chunks of speech trying to determine whether I think it 'd be impossible . professor c: It 's all gonna sound like like sine waves to you , more or less . professor c:  Well not  , it 's g all g narrow band  , i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination . It could sh be that you should , not be paying that much attention to , certain bands for certain sounds , in order to get the best result . professor c: So , what we have been doing there , just sort of mixing it all together , is certainly much much cruder than that . Now we have I guess done experiments you 've probably done stuff where you have , done separate , Viterbis on the different grad e: Yeah . Did did that help at all ? grad e: it helps for one or t one iteration but  , anything after that it doesn't help . professor c: So so that may or may t it that aspect of what he 's doing may or may not be helpful because in a sense that 's the same sort of thing . You 're taking global information and determining what you how you should But this is this is , I th I think a little more direct . phd a: How did they measure the performance of their detector ? professor c: And Well , he 's look he 's just actually looking at , the confusions between sonorant and non - sonorant . professor c: So he hasn't applied it to recognition or if he did he didn't talk about it . It 's it 's just And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , the ,  he he did a comparison to , you know , our old foil , the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth . But the one of the good questions in the audience was , well , yeah , but that wasn't trained for that .  , this use of a very smooth , spectral envelope is something that , you know , has evolved as being generally a good thing for speech recognition but if you knew that what you were gonna do is detect sonorants or not So sonorants and non - sonorants is is is almost like voiced - unvoiced , except I guess that the voiced stops are are also called \" obstruents \" .  , so it 's it 's  , but with the exception of the stops I guess it 's pretty much the same as voiced - unvoiced , phd a:   So , if you knew you were doing that , if you were doing something say for a a ,  a a Vocoder , you wouldn't use the same kind of features . Nonetheless , it was one that was interesting because , this is what we are actually using for speech recognition , these smooth envelopes . And this says that perhaps even , you know , trying to use them in the best way that we can , that that that we ordinarily do , with , you know , Gaussian mixtures and H M Ms and so forth , you you don't , actually do that well on determining whether something is sonorant or not . phd a: Didn't they professor c: Which means you 're gonna make errors between similar sounds that are son sonorant or obstruent . phd a: Didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment where they said \" if we could detect the sonorants perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition ? I thought I remember hearing about an experiment like that . professor c: That would that 's you 're right , that 's exactly the question to follow up this discussion , is suppose you did that , got that right . phd b: What could be the other low level detectors , for Other kind of features , or ? in addition to detecting sonorants or ? Th - that 's what you want to to to go for also grad e:  phd b: or ? grad e: What t Oh , build other other detectors on different phonetic features ? phd b: Other low level detectors ? Yeah . e  , w easiest thing would be to go go do some voicing stuff but that 's very similar to sonorance . grad e: phd a: When we when we talked with John Ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that w grad e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah , so there 's a half dozen like that that are grad e: Yeah , nasality . professor c: Now this was coming at it from a different angle but maybe it 's a good way to start .  , these are things which , John felt that a a ,  a human annotator would be able to reliably mark . So the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark would be tongue position kinds of things . professor c: But stress doesn't , fit in this thing of coming up with features that will distinguish words from one another , grad e:   professor c: right ? It 's a it 's a good thing to mark and will probably help us ultimate with recognition phd a: Yeah , there 's a few cases where it can like permit and permit . professor c: Well , yeah , but i either case you 'd write PERMIT , right ? So you 'd get the word right . phd a: No , I 'm saying , i i e I thought you were saying that stress doesn't help you distinguish between words . As long as you get The sequence , professor c: We 're g if we 're doing if we 're talking about transcription as opposed to something else phd a: right ? Yeah . Yeah , so that 's yeah , that 's , you know , a neat neat thing and and ,  So . grad e: S so , Ohala 's going to help do these ,  transcriptions of the meeting data ? phd a: well I don't know .  , we just talked about some possible features that could be marked by humans and , grad e:  . phd a: because of having maybe some extra transcriber time we thought we could go through and mark some portion of the data for that . professor c: that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time . professor c: But but , in the long term I guess Chuck is gonna continue the dialogue with John and and , and , we 'll we 'll end up doing some I think .  , so , y you want to talk maybe a c two or three minutes about what we 've been talking about today and other days ? grad f: Ri Yeah , OK , so , we 're interested in , methods for far mike speech recognition , mainly , methods that deal with the reverberation in the far mike signal . So , one approach would be , say MSG and PLP , like was used in Aurora one and , there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG . And so we 're interested in , comparing the performance of  , a robust approach like MSG with these , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches . grad f: And , it looks like we 're gonna use the Meeting Recorder digits data for that . phd b: And the de - reverberation algorithm , do you have can you give some more details on this or ? Does it use one microphone ? grad f: o o phd b: Several microphones ? Does it ? grad f: OK , well , there was something that was done by , a guy named Carlos , I forget his last name , who worked with Hynek , who , professor c: Avendano . grad f: it was like RASTA in the sense that of it was , de - convolution by filtering  , except he used a longer time window , phd b:   And the reason for that is RASTA 's time window is too short to ,  include the whole , reverberation  , I don't know what you call it the reverberation response . The reverberation filter from my mouth to that mike is like it 's t got it 's too long in the in the time domain for the  for the RASTA filtering to take care of it . And , then there are a couple of other speech enhancement approaches which haven't been tried for speech recognition yet but have just been tried for enhancement , which , have the assumption that  , you can do LPC  analysis of th of the signal you get at the far microphone and the , all pole filter that you get out of that should be good . It 's just the , excitation signal that is going to be distorted by the reverberation and so you can try and reconstruct a better excitation signal and , feed that through the i  , all pole filter and get enhanced speech with reverberation reduced . professor c: There 's also this , echo cancellation stuff that we 've sort of been chasing , so ,  we have ,  and when we 're saying these digits now we do have a close microphone signal and then there 's the distant microphone signal . And you could as a kind of baseline say , \" OK , given that we have both of these , we should be able to do , a cancellation . \" So that , we we , essentially identify the system in between the linear time invariant system between the microphones and and and and re and invert it , or or cancel it out to to some some reasonable approximation phd b: that 's not a practical thing , if you have a distant mike , you don't have a close mike ordinarily , but we thought that might make also might make a good baseline .  , but And then there are s  , there are single microphone methods that I think people have done for ,  for this kind of de - reverberation . Do y do you know any references to any ? Cuz I I w I was w w I I lead him down a a bad path on that . phd b: I g I guess I guess when people are working with single microphones , they are more trying to do professor c: But . phd b: well , not not very Well , there is the Avendano work , professor c: Right . phd b: but also trying to mmm ,  trying to f t find the de - convolution filter but in the  not in the time domain but in the  the stream of features  I guess . Well , @ @ there there 's someone working on this on i in Mons professor c: Yeah , OK . phd b: So perhaps , yeah , we should try t to He 's working on this , on trying to professor c: Yeah . phd b: on re reverberation ,  professor c: The first paper on this is gonna have great references , I can tell already . professor c: It 's always good to have references , especially when reviewers read it or or one of the authors and , feel they 'll \" You 're OK , you 've r You cited me . Well , he did echo cancellation and he did some fancier things like , training different network on different reverberation conditions and then trying to find the best one , but . professor c: The oth the other thing , that Dave was talking about earlier was , multiple mike things , where they 're all distant . So , there 's there 's all this work on arrays , but the other thing is , what can we do that 's cleverer that can take some advantage of only two mikes , particularly if there 's an obstruction between them , as we as we have over there . It 's part of why you have such good directionality with , with two ears phd b:   professor c: So that Yeah , the the head , in the way , is really that 's what it 's for . It 's basically , phd a: That 's what the head 's for ? To separate the ears ? professor c: Yeah , it 's to separate the ears . professor c: Yeah ? phd a: I think th that may be due to the fact that Adam ran out of digits , and didn't have time to regenerate any . professor c: Oh ! Oh ! I guess it 's Well there 's no real reason to write our names on here then , phd a: Yeah , if you want to put your credit card numbers and ,  professor c: is there ? grad e: Oh , no ? professor c: Or do did any do we need the names for the other stuff , phd a: yeah , I do need your names and and the time , and all that , professor c: or ? Oh , OK "

        "Query": "Why was the concept of an intelligent controller proposed by the user interface designer and disapproved by the project manager?",
        "Summary": "The user interface designer proposed incorporating speech recognition and gesture recognition technologies into the controller for convenience and to differentiate it from traditional controllers. However, the project manager raised concerns about the reliability of these features and the potential increase in cost. The designer suggested collaborating with a research institute to address these issues, as the vocabulary would be limited and language adaptations could be made for international users. Despite these solutions, there were still unresolved problems with the necessary microphone and camera for the technologies.",
        "Article": "project manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first  marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager: What ? marketing: No ? project manager: I I think I will let  our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . The second concept is a fancy controller ,  so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,  they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g  industrial designer:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: It's very big , user interface: if you're project manager: yeah . marketing: user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . user interface: so maybe we should  use   technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and  gesture recognition . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but as the  expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface:  I think some time it's very  convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just  speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you have one brother and one sister marketing: Yeah project manager: and they want to watch their favourite  T_V_ programme , marketing: Yeah , but the project manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , industrial designer: Yeah but Yeah user interface: Yeah , it's very interesting . industrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I don't think it project manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , industrial designer: It's it's marketing: No . user interface: so it's c come to channel three , marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . user interface: I don't have to project manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager: Yeah , but one other question . marketing:  if you if if you use the basic user interface: No no we just  have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? Or ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's  because  this technology is   for limited wor or limited wor  lexical recognition , it's very project manager: Yeah , but   user interface: it's  yeah . It's marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . industrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem , user interface: No it's  Even for the f  because the the vocabulary the industrial designer: you know when you project manager: project manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that  Baba talked about is the international industrial designer: Yeah . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , the key , the key  the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some  adaptation marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or industrial designer: Yeah but you know . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . industrial designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe project manager: okay . user interface: Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah , but how will you user interface: So industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . industrial designer: because  the for example for Se user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to industrial designer: Oh really ? That's project manager: Oh . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , but we're marketing: No , but then it's it's like this  project manager: here it's  an object . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . user interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: No no it's n y if you lose it industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . project manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it we should give the  flexibility to the user and we think marketing: Okay , so you project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if  ,  I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , but marketing: But if if if it like doubles  industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . user interface: project manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that marketing:  industrial designer: It's not really the we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But  I think a user need user interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah user interface: Okay . user interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing: Cause for example yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but  we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah ,  project manager: You don't need to tune it . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's marketing: for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . marketing:  thi this  , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The then nn marketing: or user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See user interface: That's the same marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah .  , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two  project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: industrial designer: so . marketing: industrial designer: So I think project manager: I can industrial designer: Can you go to the next one ? I  it's not this one . industrial designer: It's  oth the oth so I marketing: industrial designer: It's the working design . project manager: It's okay industrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use project manager: industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager:  I think there's something wrong with your user interface: It did didn't r receive it . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with  user interface:  to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: exac marketing: project manager: You will had s some more information in industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with user interface: project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: industrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example  d  solar energy alimentation user interface: -huh . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have  both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities  for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: industrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . project manager: And what tha what about the  materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for industrial designer: or you know , you can have some project manager: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . project manager: And you think that we will be industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know  yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or  if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . industrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .  , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  i i it sounds good technically user interface:  . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Wha what we really see this year is that  everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then  if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion  from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: Spongy 'Kay . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like  industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like  industrial designer: Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be  enough to have something working well . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No wood but Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but  ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah ,  it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: Google and project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer:  maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface:  yes . industrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: so . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . And pf what can we think a supplement to marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something added value . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the  simple vocal commands recognition . project manager:  you will have to work more , Baba , on the  spongy way to to add spongy  touch to the buttons industrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and  the colour of the  the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . project manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us  modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach "

        "Query": "What are the future prospects for data collection?",
        "Summary": "In the second phase of data collection, the group plans to use more complex scenarios to generate intricate dialogues. To ensure an adequate number of participants, subjects will be recruited from within the Psychology department, as their participation in experiments is mandatory. The group's goal is to collect over 100 hours of Meeting Recorder data, and they are currently revising the speaker consent forms. It has been proposed that subjects should sign a new consent form after every 10 recording sessions.",
        "Article": "grad g: So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working . postdoc b: And it looks like you 've found a way of  mapping the location to the without having people have to give their names each time ? phd a: Sounds like an initialization thing . postdoc b:  it 's like you have the So you know that grad g: No . postdoc b: are you going to write down that I sat here ? grad g: I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down . u And I should say that  , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly . professor e: So  , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project . grad g: And I 'm surprised I sort of I 'm surprised I forgot that , professor e: Yeah , I I 'd I think it 's some grad g: but  I think that would be a good thing to add . professor e: Yeah , well , that 's  , so I I do have a a an agenda suggestion .  , we I think the things that we talk about in this meeting  tend to be a mixture of  procedural  mundane things and  research points and  I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So  I 'm suggesting we turn it around and and  sort of we have anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later ,  hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the the research - y kind of things .  , so  the one th one thing I know that we have on that is  we had talked a a couple weeks before   about the  the stuff you were doing with with    l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was  points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean  interruptions with something else phd d: Yeah . phd d: To professor e: So at any rate you were you 've you 've done some work on that phd d: right . professor e: and  then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other  research  areas that  we 're thinking about doing .  , I think especially since you you haven't been in in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data ,  and one of the things I know that also came up  is some discussions that that  that  Jane had with Lokendra  about some some some   work about I I I d I I don't want to try to say cuz I I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some some potential collaboration there about about the about the working with these data . Well , I don't know if we if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple a couple people primarily  but   , wh why don't Actually I think that that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you you start with that . postdoc b: so , he was interested in the question of you know , relating to his to the research he presented recently ,  of inference structures , and  , the need to build in , this this sort of  mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how  , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how  , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the the the causal aspects of the  floor and and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that  it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , and  , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and  , one of them was something like  , during the course of the transcript , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and  , the question was raised \" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? \" And and Dan Ellis said , \" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now we really don't need to \" . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \" ? You know . So it 's the it 's i What you what you int what you draw you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording , grad g: metaphorically . postdoc b: that  , i that i we have enough space , and he continues , like \" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling \" . So you have to sort of get the idea that  , \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that  that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far . grad g: So , do you think his interest is in using this as a data source , or training material , or what ? professor e: Well , I I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , so  we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours grad g:   professor e: and   I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data ,  and  such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much  effort into that he should  , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're already have and see , is there anything to this at all ? grad g:   professor e: Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it . Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say \" well , this is just the wrong task for for him to pursue his \" grad g: Wrong , yeah . professor e: And and  I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that that you looked at that that it 's plausible at least .  , he was he he you know We met and he was gonna go and  you know , y look through them more systematically professor e: Yeah . postdoc b: So it 's , you know , not a matter of a professor e: Yeah . professor e: So anyway , that 's that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might might might come out from some of this .  , he 's talking about just using text postdoc b: That 's his major I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours phd c: pretty much , or ? postdoc b: and that wasn't as directly relevant to what he 's doing . postdoc b: inferences that you draw i from professor e: he certainly could use text , but we were in fact looking to see if there is there is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in in in this stuff . grad g: And I imagine that transcripts of speech  text that is speech probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing . postdoc b: Yeah , I don't think I would make that leap , because i in narratives , you know  , if you spell out everything in a narrative , it can be really tedious , grad g:   grad g: Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel and And postdoc b: Oh . And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face .  , so , if I just read that Dan was saying \" we 're ahead of the game \" in that in that context , postdoc b: Well Yeah . grad g: I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else . postdoc b: I you know , I I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them . postdoc b: This this one really does  m make you leap from So he said , you know , \" we 're ahead of the game , w we have built - in downsampling \" . postdoc b: And the inference , i if you had it written down , would be grad g: I guess it would be the same . But there are others that have backchannelling , it 's just he was less interested in those .  , I f f f I 've @ @ d A minute  , several minutes ago , I , like , briefly was was not listening and So who is \" he \" in this context ? phd c: Yeah , there 's a lot of pronoun phd f: OK . So I was just realizing we 've You guys have been talking about \" he \"  for at least  , I don't know , three three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again . Actually to make it worse , Morgan uses \" you \" and \" you \" phd f: So this is this is this is gonna be a big , big problem if you want to later do  , you know , indexing , or speech understanding of any sort . phd f: You just wrote this ? phd c: and he never said Li - He looked grad g: Well , I think he 's doing that intentionally , phd c: Right , so it 's great . grad g: aren't you ? phd c: So this is really great phd f: Right . phd c: because the thing is , because he 's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation , phd d: Yeah . phd c: Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice . postdoc b: Oh , but you 'd have the phd c: Put Morgan always like this postdoc b: You 'd have fainter phd c: and postdoc b: Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here ? professor e: Well , these grad g: Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ? Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking , now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking , I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference . grad g: So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you . professor e: I probably been affect No , I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about and concerns about \" oh gee is somebody going to say something bad ? \" and so on . professor e: And so I so I 'm I 'm tending to stay away from people 's names even though  postdoc b: I am too . phd c: Even though you could pick up later on , just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at . grad g: or or is that just too sensitive ? professor e: No no , it isn't sensitive at all . postdoc b: Well professor e: I was just I was just I was overreacting just because we 've been talking about it . professor e: It 's OK to postdoc b: I I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention .  , it fits into the m area of the mundane , but they did say You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , you know , it says \" no individuals will be identified  , \" in any publication using the data . \" OK , well , individuals being identified , let 's say you have a a snippet that says , \" Joe s  thinks such - and - such about about this field , but I think he 's wrongheaded . \" Now  , we 're we 're gonna be careful not to have the \" wrongheaded \" part in there , but but you know , let 's say we say , you know , \" Joe used to think so - and - so about this area , in his publication he says that but I think he 's changed his mind . Then the issue of of being able to trace Joe , because we know he 's well - known in this field , and all this and and tie it to the speaker , whose name was just mentioned a moment ago , can be sensitive . professor e: b But I postdoc b: So I think it 's really really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there 's a slanderous aspect to it , then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove ? professor e: Yeah , well , there 's that . But I  I think also to some extent it 's just educating the Human Subjects people , in a way , because there 's If  You know , there 's court transcripts , there 's there 's transcripts of radio shows  people say people 's names all the time . It 's just that i  you 're right that there 's more poten If we never say anybody 's name , then there 's no chance of of of slandering anybody , phd c: But , then it won't  , if we if we professor e: but grad g: It 's not a meeting . postdoc b: Well , my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it , you know . phd f: Well , if you ha since you have to  go over the transcripts later anyway , you could make it one of the jobs of the people who do that to mark grad g: Well , we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization . grad g: If we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name . professor e: So it 's postdoc b: So , we need to talk about this later . I sorta knew I was doing it but it was phd f: Well , I still don't know who \" he \" is . phd c: No , you have to say , you still don't know who \" he \" is , with that prosody .  , I I would like to move it into into  what Jose  has been doing postdoc b: Yeah . I I remind that me my first objective eh , in the project is to to study difference parameters to to find a a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded . But eh , tsk , ehhh In that way I I I begin to to study and to analyze the ehn the recorded speech eh the different session to to find and to locate and to mark eh the the different overlapping zone . And eh so eh I was eh I am transcribing the the first session and I I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events , eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I I  the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , eh I don't know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the n speech phd a: Nonspeech sounds ? phd d: Yeah . grad g: Oh , I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail . Eh , I I I do I don't need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic , but I prefer because eh I would like to to study if eh , I I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh , eh acoustic events , to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh  pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature grad g:   phd a: You know I think some of these  that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there 's two there . phd a: if it 's a tapping sound , you wouldn't necessarily or , you know , something like that , it 'd be it might be hard to know that it was two separate events . grad g: Well You weren't talking about just overlaps phd d: Ye grad g: were you ? You were just talking about acoustic events . phd d: I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general , grad g: Someone starts , someone stops Yeah . professor e: How many overlaps were there  in it ? No no , how many of them were the overlaps of speech , though ? phd d: How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session grad g: Oh , God ! phd d: in five eh in forty - five minutes . postdoc b: Does this ? So if you had an overlap involving three people , how many times was that counted ? phd d: Yeah , three people , two people . Eh ,  I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background , be professor e: No no , but I think what she 's asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ? phd d: Oh . This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh are talking together . grad g: Well So let 's postdoc b: For grad g: So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time , and then Liz starts talking also over all of us . phd d: Yeah ? grad g: Is there an event right here ? phd d: Eh no . For me is the overlapping zone , because because you you have s you have more one eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a in in a moment . If professor e: So then , in the region between since there there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking . professor e: Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event , phd d: Yeah . professor e: or are you calling the entire length of it the event ? phd d: I consider the the , nnn the nnn , nnn eh , the entirety eh , eh , all all the time there were the voice has overlapped .  , I 'm not considering eh the the ehm eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ? Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are  , eh speaking , and eh , eh a third person eh join to to that . For me , it 's eh it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event . Wi - but  , without any mark between the zone of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together , and the zone with the three speakers . grad g: Well , but But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two . phd d: I I don't know what eh will will happen with the grad g: Yep . grad g: That 's a lot of overlap , phd d: Yeah ? professor e: So again , that 's that 's three three hundred in forty - five minutes that are that are speakers , just speakers . postdoc b: But a a a th professor e: So that 's about eight per minute . postdoc b: But a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's phd d: Yeah , but Yeah . postdoc b: Well , but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot . phd c: Actually phd d: I I con I consider I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too . grad g: Silence starting or silence ending phd d: Yeah , silent , ground to bec to detect eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech .  silent , I I I I don't I I haven't the eh I I would like to to do a stylistic study professor e: Yeah . phd d: and give you eh with the report eh from eh the the study from the the the session one session . When eh eh I w I I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm the mixed file , to to transcribe , the the events and the words , I I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh collected by headphone . The the the I I I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different , but eh the the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by by that mike  qui compared with the mixed file . And so if when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn the mixed file , it 's possible eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system , it 's possible you eh in the eh i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh to nnn to do the experiments with the the system , professor e:   phd d: its possible to evaluate eh , eh or to consider eh acoustic events that which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the by the mike . The the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription . grad g: So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here phd d: Yeah . grad g: if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gonna show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM . So and I I I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I I in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh to eh to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal . phd d:  the the the signal collected by the eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech professor e:   professor e: Yeah , well , just  , just in that that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that that we we passed on to others a few months ago , there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time and and  , in the close - talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap , and in the distant mike you could . So yeah , it 's clear that if you wanna study if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap , it 's probably better to use a distant mike . professor e: On the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes , phd d: Yeah . phd c: But why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ? professor e: so it 's grad g: If you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , you would hear Jane interrupting me , but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling . And so if you 're interested in phd c: I  if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem , professor e: Some of it 's masking masked . grad g: Although the other issue is that the mixed close - talking mikes  , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that . phd d: I I I think eh I saw the nnn the eh but eh I eh I have eh any results . I I I saw the the speech file collected by eh the fet mike , and eh eh signal eh to eh to noise eh relation is eh low . phd d: And I I found that nnn that eh , ehm , pr probably , grad g: Did Did you phd d: I 'm not sure eh by the moment , but it 's it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , eh for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh in in several eh parts of the files where you you can find eh , eh eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the in the meeting , professor e:   phd d: it 's probably in in that eh in in those files you you can not find you can not process because eh it 's confused with with noise . But eh my idea is to to process only nnn , this eh nnn , this kind of s of eh speech . I 'm not sure it 's a good idea , but eh professor e: No i grad g: Well , it 's more realistic but it 'll it 'll be a lot harder . professor e: Well , it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your if i if if your concern is to get  the overlapping people people 's speech , you will you will get that somewhat better . professor e: Are you making any use  you were you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed . professor e: Now  did you make any use of that ? See I was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed . professor e: Do you phd d: The the transcription by Jane , t eh i eh , I I I want to use to to nnn , eh to put i i it 's a reference for me . But eh the transcription eh for example , I I don't I I 'm not interested in the in the in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in eh follow in the in the in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker , in the in the meeting ,  eh she she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh there is an overlapping zone . But eh there isn't any any mark , time temporal mark , to to c eh to mmm e - heh , to label the beginning and the end of the of the professor e:   Right , so she is phd d: ta I 'm I I I think eh we need this information to professor e: Right . So the twelve you you it took you twelve hours of course this included maybe some some time where you were learning about what what you wanted to do , but but  , it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes , your grad g: Twelve minutes . professor e: I thought you did forty - five minutes of phd d: No , forty - five minutes is the is the session , all the session . phd d: Tw - twelve hours of work to to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part of f professor e: Oh . I I consider all the all the session because eh I I count the nnn the nnn the overlappings marked by by Jane , professor e: Oh , OK . So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes , but you have you have time  ,  marked twelve minute the the the  overlaps in twelve minutes of it . phd f: So , can I ask can I ask whether you found  , you know , how accurate  Jane 's   labels were as far as grad g: Well , not just the overlaps , everything . phd f: you know , did she miss some overlaps ? or did she n ? phd d: But , by by the moment , I I don't compare , my my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I I want to do it . Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the in the marks , I and if I I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I I I can correct and and and to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file . phd c: Well , not only a word level , but actually phd d: Well phd f: I 'm expect I 'm not expecting phd d: No , it 's phd c: you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption , you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or grad g: Right . postdoc b: And and sometimes , you know , it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle , phd d: Yeah . postdoc b: but , yeah , w it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that i disrupt that unit in order to have , you know , a the words in the order in which they were spoken , it would have it would have been hard with the interface that we have . postdoc b: Now , my a Adam 's working on a of course , on a revised overlapping interface , phd d:  - huh . phd d: I I I think It 's it 's a good eh work , postdoc b: but phd d: but eh I think we need eh eh more information . phd f: I expect you to find more overlaps than than Jane grad g: Always need more for postdoc b: Yeah . I I have to go to phd f: because you 're looking at it at a much more detailed level . professor e: I have grad g: But if it takes sixty to one professor e: Well , I but I have a suggestion about that .  , obviously this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things which I 'm sure are gonna be very interesting , but in the interests of making progress ,  might I s how how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ? phd d: Only . professor e: but only mark speaker Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ? phd d: OK . I I I I w I I wanted to professor e: Do y do you think that would speed it up ?  , speed up your your your marking ? phd d: nnn , I don't understand very . professor e: Now , my suggestion was for the other thirty - three phd d: On - only to mark only to mark overlapping zone , but professor e: Yeah , and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ? phd d: Oh , yeah . professor e: Then I think it 's a good idea , because it phd d: Sure , because I I need a lot of time to to put the label or to do that . professor e: There 's there 's  continual noise  from fans and so forth , and there is  more impulsive noise from  taps and so forth phd d: Yeah . We know that all that 's there and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study , but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things . professor e: Whereas th i I would think that  you we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking . Then you can get the Cuz you need If it 's three hundred  i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really phd d: Yeah . professor e: And and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of  even visual sense of of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics . phd c: Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the grad g: Well , that 's That 's what I was gonna bring up . phd c: you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand , professor e: OK , yeah . professor e: So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as  there 's a bunch of things  , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one . professor e: and  , it 's not obvious , you could you could do the dumbest thing and get get it ninety percent of the time . But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the you know , the right detector . And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say \" OK this , i you know , it 's it 's really here \" . phd a: But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ? phd c: What  is get it from the close - talking mikes . phd c: A or ge get a first pass from those , professor e: We t we t w we t we talked about that . phd c: and then go through sort of It 'd be a lot faster probably to phd f: And you can grad g: Yeah , that 's his ,  professor e: We we we talked about that . s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is , phd c: Yeah , I just professor e: the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway , and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful , phd c: Right . You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better , or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurements ,  from the close - talking mike . phd c: Well , that 's what I wonder , because  or how bad it is , professor e: Well phd c: be  , because that would be interesting grad g: I 'm working on a program to do that , and phd c: especially because the bottleneck is the transcription . phd c: so  it seems like one kind of project that 's not perfect , but  , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know , if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech , professor e: Right , we discussed that . phd c: you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ? grad g: And postdoc b: Oh . grad g: I 've I 've written a program to do that , phd c: OK , I 'm sorry I missed the grad g: and it ,  professor e: It 's OK . And , it seems to work , I 've I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something , and I haven't I don't what I 'm working on was working on was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , into Transcriber . I 've worked on it for about half a day , grad h: I have to go . grad g: so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with . professor e: See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working , because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided , phd c: Right . phd c: It professor e: So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when when he he gets his thing going , grad g: But professor e: and phd c: Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of postdoc b:   postdoc b: Was that  there m there was this already a script I believe  that Dan had written , that  handle bleedthrough ,  cuz you have this this close you have contamination from other people who speak loudly . So I I haven't tried that , but that If It it might be something it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little . postdoc b: So , some thought of maybe having Yeah , having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours . professor e: But but that 's a refinement postdoc b: That 's what we were discussing . professor e: and I think we wanna see try the simple thing first , cuz you add this complex thing up  afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first . professor e: But  , having having somebody have some experience , again , with with  with marking it from a human standpoint , we 're  , I don't expect Jose to to do it for  f fifty hours of of speech , but  we if  if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it . professor e: And when when  Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different . phd a: You know , I did I did  something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs , and it works pretty well .  , i almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with a median filter , you look for runs . phd a: And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to to do it . grad g: Yeah , do you have a patent on it ? phd a: It was when I was working for the government . postdoc b: Well , is this something that we could just co - opt , or is it ? phd a: Nah . I think I think it 's phd a: Yeah , he 's it it doesn't take a long time . I just thought if it was tried and true , then and he 's gone through additional levels of of development . Although if you if you have some parameters like what 's a good window size for the median filter phd a: Oh ! I have to remember . phd f: They grad g: I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , sorts of numbers . professor e: I don't know , it if if we want to  So , maybe we should move on to other other things in limited time . postdoc b: Can I ask one question about his statistics ? So so in the tw twelve minutes , if we took three hundred and divided it by four , which is about the length of twelve minutes , i  , I 'd expect like there should be seventy - five overlaps . postdoc b: Did you find  more than seventy - five overlaps in that period , or ? phd d: More than ? postdoc b: More than How many overlaps in your twelve minutes ? phd d: How many ? Eh , not @ @ I Onl - only I I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the professor e: Yeah . phd d: but eh I I don't co eh I don't count eh the the overlap . phd d: I consider I I The the nnn The the three hundred is eh considered only you your transcription . grad g: I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than than sort of the middle . grad g: Because i we 're we 're dealing with the  , in the early meetings , we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , and things like that , phd d: Yeah . professor e: So so I was gonna ask , I guess about any any other things that that that either of you wanted to talk about , especially since Andreas is leaving in five minutes , that that you wanna go with . phd c: Can I just ask about the data , like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data , just cuz I 'm I wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what what can be done first and like how many meetings are we recording professor e: Right so there 's this this There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed . phd c: and professor e: That piece was then  sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point . Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and  put on CD - ROM and sent  to IBM . phd c: How many meetings is that ? Like how many grad g: What 's that ? professor e: That was about ten hours , and there was about phd c: t ten It 's like ten meetings or something ?  - huh . And then then we phd a: Ten meetings that have been sent to IBM ? phd c: And professor e: Yeah . grad g: Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the missing files . phd a: H how many total have we recorded now , altogether ? professor e: We 're saying about twelve hours . And we 're recording only this meeting , like continuously we 're only recording this one now ? or ? professor e: No . No , so the the that 's the that 's the biggest one  , chunk so far , grad g: Nope . phd c: Do they meet every week , professor e: And then there phd c: or every professor e: they do . w w And we talked to them about recording some more and we 're going to , we 've started having a morning meeting , today  i starting a w a week or two ago , on the  front - end issues , and we 're recording those ,  there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded , phd c: Great . So actually , we 're gonna h start having a a pretty significant chunk and so , you know , Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff things like that , now that  the things are starting to happen . So right now , yeah , I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings , but there are scattered other meetings in it and that that amount is gonna grow  so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately i if we 're if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , you know , twenty or thirty percent of it , not not not eighty or ninety . phd c: So there 's probably there 's three to four a week , grad g: That 's what we 're aiming for . professor e: Yeah and th the the other thing is I 'm not pos I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times , that I really don't know maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty , but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .  in fact , the morning group is really motivated cuz they 're working on connected digits , so it 's grad g: Actually that 's something I wanted to ask , is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits . grad g: We don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and I have those . grad g: And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance .  , if I did that , is someone gonna be working on it ? professor e: yeah , I I think definitely s so Absolutely . grad g: is it something of interest ? professor e: Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that .  , I I 'm I 'm interested in it , I just don't have time to do it now . phd f: I was these meetings I 'm sure someone thought of this , but these this  reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do  adaptation . phd c: Actually I have o grad g: I I would really like someone to do adaptation . grad g: So if we got someone interested in that , I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder . professor e: Well  , one of the things I wanted to do , that I I talked to to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation , grad g: Since it 's the same people over and over . professor e: to try to get rid of some of the effects of the the the far - field effects .  ,  we have the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation phd f:   professor e: because people move around , and  , if if it 's if it 's  not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's it 's it 's you can't really do inversion , phd f:   professor e: and even echo cancellation is going to  be something It may you Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we 've taken is more \" lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal \" . But it occurred to me a few months ago that  party lines are always , you know , sort of dangerous . And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do . So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close  mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation .  , there was a have been some nice talks recently by by Lucent on on their b phd f:  . professor e: the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me ,  you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . And  , you know , th phd a: W what is the  the artifact you try to you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ? phd f: Ciao . professor e:  so it 's it you have a a direct   , what 's the difference in If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would  phd f: I 'm signing off . that would subtract off the   parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so so   I guess in most echo cancellation Yeah , so you Given that  Yeah , so you 're trying to So you 'd There 's a a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the there 's a a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract essentially to subtract off  different  different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had you had some  some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a there 's an echo . phd a: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those .  , just the raw data , you would you might hear kind of an echo ? And and then this noise cancellation would get professor e: Well , I 'm I 'm I 'm saying That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening . What 's really happening is Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you  try to r you To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I but not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the the room response , but just to try to   eliminate some of the the effect of some of the echos .  , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone ,  it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . You say I I I want to use this  this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this this filtered version  of the speech  gets   gets subtracted off from the original speech . phd a: Kind of a clean up thing , that professor e: It 's a clean up thing . professor e: So , echo cancelling is is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and and and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike . phd a: When  , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a  some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was  And then it would come on and it was very clear , professor e: Yeah . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So  ,  anyway that 's that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try somebody look And and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was  large vocabulary speech or anything .  postdoc b: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ? professor e: Brian 's Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that  doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible ,  i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know There 's also  oh yeah , noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those those echos . But  if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right you know , right right  delays are is ,  is right delayed signal is is is  is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , also in a in a situation that 's very reverberant with long reverberation times and really long delays , it 's it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a a c a complete inversion , if you actually I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics .  , that 's difficult because  often times the the  the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually  , you know , rings , and and  goes to infinity . So it 's so there 's there 's there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents  there 's all sorts of all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons ,  we we we sort of  , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and  we decided to do this approach of taking  , just picking  features , which were  will give you more something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . I guess you you actually already said this thing about the  about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to So this was the human subjects folks who said this , or that that ? postdoc b: The a apparently  , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course .  but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it that often , but  just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .  , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that that we have . We have we have an hour  that that is transcribed , we have we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going ,  by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we if this really  Well , do we have that much ? phd c: Not really . professor e: Let 's see , we have phd c: So that 's what You know , that professor e:  eight weeks ,  is phd c: So that 's not a lot of hours . professor e: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's Yeah , so like thirty thirty hours ? phd a: Three Three hours .  I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with  energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves , professor e: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester . phd c: so professor e: Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours . phd c: is there Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of deci  , that are less well I don't  , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong grad g: We had some good ones earlier . phd c: There 's laughter ,  I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or grad g: I think it 's hard to record those . phd c: To be allowed to record them ? postdoc b: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards . professor e: Yeah , people will get postdoc b: But I but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea . So I I  , I I 'd mentioned to Adam , and that was another thing I was gonna talk  , mention to them before that  there 's  It it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to  acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , that that  it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a ,  or and and so it doesn't really give us the the the  characteristics we want . But  , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show , or this you know , this discussion show , and  can you record multi - channel ? \" And  they may be willing to record it  with phd c: With lapel mikes or something ? professor e: Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant . professor e: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they they they start recording , isn't als also is not going to be this exact setup . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live ,  that we could invite them to have like some of their record some of their shows here . postdoc b: Wow ! phd c: Well Or The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount  , they 're on the radio , grad g: Right , as we are . phd c: Th - that 's an a side of style a style that we 're not collecting here , so it 'd be great . professor e: And and the  , the other side to it was the what which is where we were coming from I 'll I 'll talk to you more about it later is that is that there 's there 's  the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably ,  related to , you know , legal issues and and permissions and all that . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and  and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . The thing was , I was hoping that we could @ @ in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . Yeah I was mostly trying to think , \" OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with . And you you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your your data for awhile so  right now and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM right ? Do Oh , do we now ? professor e: Well , we don't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was phd c: So  , not complaining , I was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus  six months from now professor e: Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like , grad g: Right . professor e: and and and  and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can you can do a lot of other things . phd c: Cuz I 'm not actually sure , just logistically that I can spend you know , I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time . phd c:  anyway , I shouldn't say too much , but  if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person . And so it 's professor e: i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now .  , three months from now  ,  the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , unreasonable to say that  in January , you know , ro roughly  which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours . phd c: And we just don't know about the transcription part of that , professor e: So that 's postdoc b: Yeah , we need to I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards , phd c: so .  , it postdoc b: and  es especially since these people won't be  used to dealing with multi - channel  transcriptions . postdoc b: So I think that we 'll need to adjust some And also if we wanna add things like  , well , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through . There 'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several  , you know , friends , and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to , right ? professor e: If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @  , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions , but I think if it 's a real Why not ? Yeah . postdoc b: You could do this , phd c: Well yeah , postdoc b: you know . phd c: or just if you 're if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't  have them do the digits , or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it was , you know , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do . grad g: We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to . phd c: Then , having the data is very valuable , cuz I think it 's  politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data , especially with the ITR , if we put in a proposal on it .  , whether it 's transcribed or not  , is another issue , but there 's there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions , or at least that you can start to answer . phd a: Would it help at all  , we 're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings . One is   without doing the digits Or , I guess the full - blown one is where you do the digits , and everything , and then talk about doing it without digits , what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff . I 'm really scared grad g: It seems like it 's a big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes . phd c:  or at least , like , me personally ? I would I couldn't use that data . phd c: So it 's a great idea , professor e: Yeah , I I b By the by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck . phd c: and if it were true than I would just do that , but it 's not that bad like the room is not the bottleneck , and we have enough time in the room , it 's getting the people to come in and put on the and get the setup going . Right ? And and  d Do you have any idea when when  the you 'll be able to send  the ten hours to them ? grad g: Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have . So early next week we send it to them , and then then we check with them to see if they 've got it and we we start , you know asking about the timing for it . professor e: So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on . professor e: Right ? grad g: Yeah , but professor e: Well grad g: Yeah , who knows where they are . professor e: Yeah , but You know , so they they they have you know , they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do , phd c: What if grad g: Yeah , you we can't complain . professor e: right ? But they But at any rate , they 'll I I think once they get that sorted out , they 're they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they who 's who is doing it , and  I think it 's not going to be I don't think it 's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour , I think . phd c: Really ? So it 's the amount of professor e: It 's it 's just getting it going . phd c: I don't know , if there 's any way without too much more overhead , even if we don't ship it right away to IBM even if we just collect it here for awhile , to record you know , two or three more meeting a week , just to have the data , even if they 're  not doing the digits , but they do wear the headphones ? professor e: But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and phd c: No , I meant , sorry , the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs , maybe they don't wanna be recorded , but grad g: Oh , and we 're just chatting ? phd c: Just the ch the chatting . phd c: I actually I actually think that 's useful data ,  the chatting , grad g: Yeah , the problem with that is I would I think I would feel a little constrained to You know ?  , some of the meetings phd c: but OK . phd c: Alright , so I 'll just throw it out there , if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI ,  that we could record , I think it would be worth it . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW   really m a lot more than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus , grad g: Right . phd a: Is the  , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ? professor e: they seem to have some problems with it .  , but , again , Jerry is Jerry 's open So  , we have two speech meetings , one  network meeting ,  Jerry was open to it but I I s One of the things that I think is a little a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved  in our work , we probably can't do it every week . You know ? I I I I think that that people are gonna feel  are gonna feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . And the then so then they can just really sort of try to put the mikes on and then just charge in and grad g: Yep . phd c: What if we give people you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ? postdoc b: Well , you know , I I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise . postdoc b: But I had another question , which is  , you know , in principle , w  , I know that you don't want artificial topics , phd c: Alright , alright , alright . postdoc b: but  it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial . postdoc b: and i you know , people who are Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the the  goldibears goldi goldilocks , it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small . And  a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word . phd a: Well , even  , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about postdoc b: We could pay subjects . phd a: or what about people in the in the building ? phd c: Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo phd a: there 's the State of California downstairs , and phd c: Yeah .  grad g: I just really doubt that  any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public . grad g: So I  I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition phd c: Alright , well . grad g: and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said \" well maybe we could have meetings down here \" , but then I got email from them that said \" no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . phd a: What about Joachim , maybe he can professor e: But but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . professor e:  i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but phd a: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones . phd c: Well , and they 're already they 're these things are already recorded , grad g: Yep . phd c: we don't have to ask them to even and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual professor e: n Well No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones phd c: Why why not ? professor e: because because because we would be asking them to do something different . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested  in in LDC getting data , and professor e: Right , that 's the found data idea . professor e: But what I 'm saying is  if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere phd c: Right .   professor e: and  But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they  might be e e willing to the I might be able to talk them into it . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here . Well I don't why don't we why d u why don't we   turn them turn grad g: OK , leave leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time <doc-sep>You know how to toggle the display width function grad a: Well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet .  , so we haven't had a meeting for a while , and and probably won't have one next week , I think a number of people are gone .  , so Robert , why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with EDU ? grad b:  in a in a smaller group we had  , talked and decided about continuation of the data collection . So Fey 's time with us is almost officially over , and she brought us some thirty subjects and , t collected the data , and ten dialogues have been transcribed and can be looked at . She 's actually suggested to look  , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements . And  , we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time , two days , for example , to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time , and , sort of package the whole thing in a in a re in a few more complicated  , structure . As for SmartKom , I 'm the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis , which as of this morning should be resolved . grad b: \" should be \" means they aren't yet , but but I think I have the info now that I need . Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow , so maybe   , when tomorrow is over , we 're done . And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again Maybe it 'll take some more time , to be realistic , but at least we 're we 're seeing the end of the tunnel there .  , the  ,  I don't think we need to discuss the formalism that 'll be done officially s once we 're done .  , something happened , in on Eva 's side with the PRM that we 're gonna look at today , and  , we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University . grad a: So when you said \" Andreas \" I thought you were talking about Stolcke . grad b: And , grad a: Now I know that we aren't , OK . grad b: Eh grad c: Cuz there is another Andreas around , grad a:  . grad b: So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University , one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied . And , the  , he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he 's actually doing , and why it is s somewhat related , and by  using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using .  , so , I 've be just been looking at , Ack ! What are you doing ? Yeah .  , so , this is , sort of like the latest thing I have on it , and I sorta constructed a couple of classes . Like , a user class , a site class , and and you know , a time , a route , and then and a query class . And I tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually  , look at it more .  , so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , and then tried to The red lines on the , graph are the  , relations between the different  , classes . Like , a user has like , a query , and then , also has , you know  , reference slots to its preferences , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest . And so this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that . And So I tried to construct the dependency models , and a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on , and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see how I can do ,  put in the computational nodes in between . And so I ended up making several classes Actually , you know , a class of with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility . And so some of these classes are s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . S like , these here , it 's only like , user , but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the  , preference of the user is versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or you know , which form of transportation the user has and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case . And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites in in mind . And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , and that makes a I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . And so , I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , cuz otherwise you would c well , it 's probably the same . But  , No , you would definitely have be able to re - use , like , all the user stuff , and not not having to recompute a lot of the stuff , because it 's all from the user side . But , you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how  , using the PRM will help .  , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes . And that would basically it 's just another class in the model , with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . And then , after you group them together this no the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this .  , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff . And one is basically how desirable a site is meaning , how good it matches the needs of a user .  , so , instead of  , doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of the user wants to visit , I 'll come well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . And for each site , you know , where h how how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it . She 's ac   Eva 's got a little write - up on it that  , probably gives the the details to anybody who needs them .  , so the You you didn't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation . So one so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is grad d:   professor f: we aren't gonna build our own interpreter , so if if we can't find one , then we  , go off and do something else and wait until s one appears .  , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down . If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually  , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it .  , I actually think it is cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , will help in the expression . I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net , without going to some incredible hacking of sort of rebuilding it on the fly .  , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net . So , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert i it looked to me like if Eva were able to come up with a you know , value for each of a number of  , sites plus its EVA thing , that a travel planner should be able to take it from there . And you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever , and then plan a route . grad b:  -  , well , first of all  , great looks , mu much cleaner , nnn , nnn , Certain certain beauty in it , so , if beauty is truth , then ,  we 're in good shape . So if you have a write - up then  , I 'd love to read it grad d:   grad b: and  because , i Can you go all the way back to the the very top ? grad d: Yeah . grad b:  these @ @ these w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ? grad d: I can't really see the whole thing . grad b: or are they have they changed , in a sense ? grad d: Well I think I basically leave them to similar things . grad d: Some of the things might that might be different , maybe like are that the hours for the site . grad d: And , eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not . grad d: And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction , and and or stuff like that . grad b: And the , other question I would have is that presumably , from the way the Stanford people talk about it , you can put the probabilities also on the relations . I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not , grad a: Mmm . grad b: It 's sort of in the definition or in the in Daphne 's definition of a PRM is that classes and relations , professor f: OK . grad b: and you 're gonna have CPT 's over the classes and their relations . grad d: I remember them learning when , you know , you don't know the structure for sure , professor f: Yeah . grad d: but I don't remember reading how you specify grad b: Yeah , that would be exactly my question . So , the the plan is is when Daphne gets back , we 'll get in touch and supposedly , we 'll actually get s deep seriously connected to to their work and grad b: Yep . professor f: somebody 'll  , you know If it 's a group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever . We get rocking and rolling on this again , once we get a package , if , when , and how , then this becomes foregrounded grad d:   grad b: And  , until then we 'll come up with a something that 's @ @ that 's way more complicated for you . grad b: Because this was laughingly easy , right ? grad d: Actually I had to take out a lot of the complicated stuff , cuz I I made it really complicated in the beginning , and Jerry was like , \" this is just too much \" . So , you could , from this , go on and say suppose there 's a group of people traveling together and you wanted to plan something that somehow , with some Pareto optimal  , thing for grad a: That 's good . professor f: or grad a: Except for humans can't really solve it either , so . Well that 's the that would that would be a  , you could sell it , as a grad a: Yeah . professor f: OK , eh you don't have to fight about this , just give your preferences to the grad a: And then you can blame the computer . But what does it  Would a pote potential result be to to split up and never talk to each other again ? You know . So there i there are some some u  , you know , elaborations of this that you could try to put in to this structure , but I don't think it 's worth it now . But  , it 's good , yeah and and there were a couple other ideas of of  , things for Eva to look at in in the interim . So , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's  that 's relevant to you  , a at the moment , the the reason is really for me  , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . And and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , and  , I just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and and so I 'll be  , happy to talk to you and and  , I 'd also like to find out some more and and maybe I 'll just walk around the office and and then and ask some some questions , in a couple days . OK , so , what I started looking at , to begin with is just  , content management systems  , i i in general . So  ,  what 's  Sort of the state of the art there is to   you have a bunch of of  documents or learning units or learning objects , and you store meta - data  , associate to them . So there 's some international standards like the I - triple - E ,  There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard , and  , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have  author information , you have  , size information , format information and so on . One is  you store keywords associated with the  with the document , and one is  , you have sort of a , well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic  , ordering of of the of the units . Now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses ,  you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit  , assumption behind that is that  , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of  , whichever taxonomy is used , and  , I think that 's a that 's a very that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and  As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , science , biology , and then But that 's really all that we have at the moment . Now , what this  a standard like this would give us is we could  , sort of  with a search engine just query  , different repositories all over the world . But we can't really  , so what I 'm what I try to do is  , to have  ,  So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . Now , what what we have at our university quite a bit is that  , students  , try to u program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same problems , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and so , what I want to build is basically a a smart F A Q system . Now , what you  need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than \" I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . I 'm I 'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , context it , and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . So , I want to be able to model information like , so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , maybe what 's the background of that student 's  , which  , which error message was encountered . Now , basically giving this   so we somehow need to have a formalized  , way of writing this down basically , and that 's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again . And , using this and some some  , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some some simple inferences . Like you know that when somebody 's working about  , working on on servlets for example , he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used are written in Java . So some some inferences like that , now , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of  off the documents you 're you 're searching against . So ,  what I wanna do is basically have some sort of  given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match , and use this as a metric in the search . Now , what I plan to do is I want to  sort of do a   try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth  ,  steepest descent approach . So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? And and having  ,  a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , and find out which  which questions are worth  , asking . And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is  , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system  quickly , that that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . And   , so Robert was mentioning  , earlier today is that  , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network , which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . And so ,  what I 'm What I try to do is basically try to model this  , in a way that you could really combine  , knowledge from very different sources , and and  , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community  , came up with . Trying to to have  , an approach how to integrate s  certain  representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , what you can do with those . What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic  , computational model . And then  ,  sort of as an add - on to this whole idea ,  that would be now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which  , which  , rules and which ontologies it it uses , or basically its view of the world ,  you can get very different results . And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach , where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , and  , if you have a question about a homework , it 's probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , rather than going to some Yahoo - like  , search engine . And I think a lot of the even though it 's a it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , issues are are fairly similar . grad a: And so some of the I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , I Are you grad c:  I know , yeah I know abou about it . It 's like , you know , the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret , grad c:   We - we 've kind of talked about that , but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse . grad b: Well , in a in one t one s mmm , small difference in a in a way , is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer , but he wants to point to the places w w grad a: Documents that have the answers . So I 'm I 'm not I 'm not building an expert grad a: you have to s still m understand what the content says about itself , and then match it to what you think the informational needs grad a:   You 're just taking the keywords as a topic text , as grad c: I I assume that that the there will be learning systems that that tag their their content . grad c: And  , m @ @ and basically what I what I envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an FAQ for example you could state sort of like a logic condition , when this document applies . So \" this document explains how to set up your  , mail account on Linux \" or something like this . So something something very specific that you can then But the I think that the key point with these  , learning systems is that  , a learning system is only as good as  the amount of content it it carries . grad c: You can have the best learning system with the best search interface , if there 's no content inside of it , it 's not very useful . So I think ultimately because  ,  developing these these rules and these inference  inferences I think is very costly , so  ,  I think you must be able to reuse some some existing  , domain domain information , or or or ontologies that that  other people wrote and then try to integrate them , and then also search the entire web basically , rather than just the small  , content management system . grad c: So I think that 's that 's crucial for for the success of or @ @ grad a: So , you 're not I guess I 'm trying to figure out how how it maps to the kinds of things that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups , grad c:   grad a: cuz some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses , and I 'm guessing that you you won't be doing that ? OK . grad a: So , you take the query , and and professor f: On the other hand , FrameNet could well be useful . professor f: Because , you know , the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames , and the frames may well give you additional keywords or  , if you know that that that a a bunch of keywords  , indicate a frame , then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame , rather th than just  , individual grad c: Mmm . There 's linguists and stuff and there 's a lot of it and they 're they 're busily working away . And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that . I 'm sure I could learn a lot about  , yeah , just how to how to come up with these structures , grad a: Mmm . grad c: cuz it 's it 's very easy to whip up something quickly , but it maybe then makes sense to to me , but not to anybody else , and and if we want to share and integrate things , they must well , they must be well designed really . grad b: And Andreas and I tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with a eh with him working on an interface for FrameNet , as it was back then , that would p do some of the work for this machine , professor f: Right . grad b: which  , never got done because Prashant found a happy occupation professor f: W yeah , I know ,  it it he w he did w what what he did was much more s sensible for him . professor f: I think  , grad b: But so I 'm just saying , the  , we had that idea professor f: you know Yeah . professor f: Yeah , actually you guys never grad b: And Srini 's doing information extraction also , right ? professor f: Right . grad c: professor f: this was supposedly an exchange program , and I we you know , it 's fine . We don't care , but it just I 'm a little surprised that  , Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send .  I had forgotten a I To be honest with you , I 'd totally forgotten we had a program . grad b:  it 's in the program ? grad c:  I I think it 's it 's really the lack of students  , at IU at the moment . I think it 's ju it 's more the lack of of students , really , and w we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams . grad c: Well  if if I were a student , I 'd love to come here , rather than work for some German company , or professor f: Yeah . professor f: Oh , right ! grad c: Well , I didn't say anybody to anything to offend well , except for the sponsors maybe , but professor f: Right . So I thi tha that 's that 's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you 're here . professor f: unfortunately , Srini , who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town . professor f: I don't know why he @ @ oh , I , who knows ? grad a: The  professor f: Anyway , s yeah , you 'll see you 'll certainly see a lot of the people there . grad a: The other person I thought of is Dan Gildea ? because he did some work on topic spotting professor f: Yeah . I don't Depending on how well you wanna integrate with that end , grad c:   grad a: you know , like , taking the data and fig you said the learning systems that figure out We There 's someone in ICSI who actually has been working on has worked on that kinda stuff , and he 's worked with frame net , so you could talk to him about , you know , both of those things at once . grad c: So , who is that again ? grad a: And , he 's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff , grad b: Who ? I can take you to his office . professor f: Alright , was there anything else for this ? One of these times soon we 're gonna hear about construal . professor f: Good thinking ! grad b:  well , maybe I can I can bribe my way out of this . professor f: Well , no , but he 's he 's he 's he 's as you said , he 's , like the state legislature , he 's trying to offer us bribes . grad b: This  Oh , they refused the budget again ? Is it so about CITRIS ? Yeah , still nothing . professor f: this this this t the s we 're , involved in a literally three hundred million dollar  , program . And , the State of California is now a month and a half behind its legis its legally required date to approve a budget . professor f: and , yesterdayday there was this   I thought that the other branch would just approve it , but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who who approved it got flak from there , eh anyway . So ,  Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , OK ? And then we 'll go . In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS , even though we don't have the money they So they 've been hiring people right and left , so , they think the money 's coming . And , is now doing all the politics for CITRIS , but also , has a  , a lot of interest in  , actually doing things for society , so digital divide and stuff like that . But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , something that is of great social value . He said , \" for example \" , this was his only example , \" if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , and as compelling as a video game , then that would have a huge social impact \" . So it was nice that  , he 's got this view , of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B , language would be a good way to do it . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing , grad a:  - huh . professor f: but , you know , a again , if if you if you grad a: Oh . So this is reading , rather than teaching Another project we started on , and and didn't get funded for was , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , for kids whose first language wasn't English . So , enormous problem in California , and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build  , programs that would be tutors for the kids . professor f: and  , I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now , but it i it 's it 's interesting and I may  , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that . So I I did manage to get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS , professor f: No , no . grad b: but , I I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n  among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings , professor f: Yeah . grad b: and also revising , thanks for all the comments , the c the original construal proposal . And , if I put one and one together , I may end up with a number that 's greater than one and that I I can potentially present once you get back . Yeah , so OK , so that 'd be great , but I 'd I think it 's it 's time again , right ? grad b: Absolutely . grad b: But  , and hopefully all sidetracking  , other things will have disappeared , soon "

        "Query": "Summarize the main points discussed in Marketing's presentation during the last meeting and the group's feedback on it.",
        "Summary": "The remote control should not only be small, easy to use, and eye-catching, but also have buttons with a soft feel and a trendy design, possibly incorporating fruit and vegetable elements. Marketing suggested incorporating one or two star features, such as speech recognition, to build the campaign around. The energy source for the remote should be a battery, and it was emphasized that the remote should be brought to the market before the competition. Marketing emphasized the importance of adopting the latest trends and fashion updates for the remote control, particularly for the targeted young users. This includes features like an LCD screen, vivid colors, and a cool shape. However, it was noted that the decisions made regarding the interface did not align with the desired look and feel. The team discussed the possibility of incorporating Bluetooth functionality, but ultimately decided against it. They also explored the idea of using squeezable rubber as an energy generator. Easy usability was another key point raised by Marketing, who suggested incorporating fruit-shaped buttons to align with the upcoming fashion trend. The Project Manager proposed marketing the control in different colors for different groups of people, similar to the iPod. During the evaluation process, Marketing expressed dissent regarding the financial aspects of the design, highlighting the need for further adjustments during budget control. The lack of information about prices led to unrealistic discussions about costly functions like recognition. Marketing believed that users would be interested in a speech recognizer to simplify program selection and reduce the number of buttons. The remote control should also be small and affordable. The team briefly considered lighting adapting options but ultimately left the decision to the Industrial Designer and User Interface designer. The team also discussed potential user-friendly features, including tracking devices to recognize personal preferences and a voice activator to help locate the remote. However, due to budget constraints, these ideas were set aside. The Industrial Designer mentioned the importance of considering repetitive strain injury (RSI) in the ergonomic design process and suggested using touch buttons instead of press buttons to mitigate this issue.",
        "Article": "marketing: Hello project manager:  like before we  I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting marketing:  it was discussed in the last meeting  which was opened by the presentation from the interface  designer that  looks would be very important on this new remote user interface: Designer . It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera .  speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal  features she would like see d d to be integrated in this  in this new remote . user interface: project manager:  marketing: And she was challenged on that point project manager: that's right . industrial designer: project manager: But  her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful .  technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the  to the generat to the generator amplification and  the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature  to to to consider . project manager: She would like  this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip  scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . The marketing expert  who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . To do that  maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . And the decision that we took last time was that  the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery  should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . industrial designer:  and it's it's blue in colour  bright and  it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons marketing: industrial designer:   and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . marketing: You used to have all the buttons user interface: industrial designer:  yeah and   the material which we are going to use for the case is  plastic and  w which which is s strong   and also  for the  the material is plastic and  for the buttons it is  s soft rubber  and als marketing: Oh that's good , industrial designer: yeah . industrial designer: Yeah because   you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . industrial designer: And then   for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green marketing: Now these features includes the s  signal emitting  signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . user interface: we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness marketing: Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . marketing: The next channel in the numeric pattern , or user interface: No , swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . user interface: And at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . user interface: give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective . industrial designer: marketing: Okay , well  what what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , user interface: Yes , yes . marketing: that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands industrial designer: marketing: and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ? project manager: Yes the buttons are all raised , right ? marketing: The buttons are all raised project manager: Are raised , marketing: and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , project manager: Right . user interface: industrial designer: marketing:  and  I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . project manager: Yes , and it sort of sticks up so that you really marketing: Yeah , that's great . project manager: you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah ,  the  these buttons  around here are the mute user interface: No , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . project manager: So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . marketing: And this brings the menu up on the screen ? user interface: Pardon me ? This is the menu yes , yes . marketing: This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are user interface: A the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , marketing: Okay . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Okay and now I'm supposed to project manager: Well , I have one question marketing: yeah . project manager:  will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? user interface: Yes , it will have  these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . project manager: Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it user interface: Yes , which can be easily recognised . marketing: Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Text that we can have on the case itself , project manager: That's right . user interface: And and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . marketing: Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow industrial designer: marketing: and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that user interface: project manager: Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? marketing: So project manager: That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual marketing: I think voice recognition is our big selling point industrial designer:  . project manager: And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . marketing: So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image  play with the visual and then the voice recognition . project manager: Okay , now  having said that marketing: I'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't I ? project manager: No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we  just have done . marketing: Ah , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something . marketing: Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? Or project manager: Oh , okay yeah , okay , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  electronics , simple chip on print ? Is that's what we're using ? user interface: Yes . project manager:  but , yes but industrial designer: I think  that is  f for rubbers that is  yeah case material . project manager: That's just for the case material , user interface: Is this for the case ? Yes . project manager: so special colours though , we having that , marketing: Oh okay , the - , ' kay . marketing: 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , right ? project manager: No . project manager: button supplement special colour ? user interface: Speci Yes project manager: Special form ? user interface: Yes d we do have special form . user interface: One two three four five six seven eight nine project manager:  ? industrial designer: Maybe it is it just n project manager: Eight , eight point two . marketing: Okay , well  obviously my method for  s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . marketing: We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . marketing: And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . marketing: And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons industrial designer: marketing: and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . industrial designer: marketing: So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel  and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . marketing: They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . The size is small  and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . I think that it's I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven . And then functionality  I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . marketing: So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . project manager: And  I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . marketing: Well ,  we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? project manager: Eight , eight twenty , yes . industrial designer: Eight twenty so marketing: And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend . industrial designer: We have  four euros , yeah project manager:  maximum we have another four point three euros  four thirty . Well  that's project manager: But  we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . marketing: Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . project manager: I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just  recog I just remembered that there was no that that was not  included  that there was no room for any special features , okay ? industrial designer: Included , yeah . You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ? marketing: well I isn't this my last slide ? project manager: I dunno .  and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . project manager: Why ? Wh why you need that up ? marketing:  ? Well because I can't remember what I put on there . Okay user interface: marketing: you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . user interface: industrial designer: marketing:  and then how about how we doing on colour ? project manager: Colour  I marketing: Colour , I gave it a one . marketing: Okay , I gave it a three , two , user interface: I'll give three . marketing: And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but project manager: Well it's also you can't really try it out  the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view marketing: Yeah .  the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . marketing: But  otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product . Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? project manager:  . Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? user interface: We can always improve , yes .  I think they are quite big , so I think I  we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . Well then again if we're gonna  do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . marketing: So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . marketing:  and a couple of other th maybe comp  consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . project manager: Y  al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget industrial designer: user interface: And maybe project manager: and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just  add a whole lot of more things . project manager:   we need  you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . project manager: So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ?  ,  are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ?  I think personally I think  I'm pretty happy . marketing: I'm pretty happy with it too , yeah  , project manager:  an industrial designer: Even I'm happy . project manager: and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?  marketing: I think you've done a good job , Miss leader . project manager: And I think team work I think was very very good , I think we really industrial designer: project manager: And  I think we are we happy with the means we used ? We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things . marketing: Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , user interface: Whiteboard more , yes , yes .  , it's maybe not in the best position in the room  you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit . project manager: I think we we did ,  in more than one respect and  so I think we did very well here . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: project manager: So I I thank you all very much . project manager: I always get it on here , but getting it off is industrial designer: Do we do we have some time left ?  you have user interface: They say it's forty minutes . project manager: Ah yes we have time later marketing: But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished . marketing: It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace <doc-sep>user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And this  design , detailed design meeting  we will discuss  the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . If you hold it and you press another button ,  the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? user interface: So Yeah . marketing: when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . user interface: that's just  the normal  as th as the normal  remote controls  So  You put it  you  came in  page  one hundred . user interface: Oh yeah ? project manager: But  I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . user interface: industrial designer: I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this . industrial designer: because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ? industrial designer: Yeah , they're project manager: Just n normal plain buttons . user interface: it industrial designer: But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . project manager: If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see  something wrong . project manager: I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . project manager: Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . project manager: I think we can  discard the help and the mute button  by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . project manager: And this is marketing: d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ? project manager: No those are one , I think . Where did  marketing: Well , think actually there're two buttons , user interface: it's just one button . project manager: So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing marketing: Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . user interface: So  , project manager: Yeah w user interface: we've still got four buttons , but just  So project manager: Yeah th I think they count  the materials . user interface: You got  not not a butt button itself , but  on the  project manager: Yeah on the chip there . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . project manager: I think they  try t industrial designer: If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . project manager: That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? marketing: Only the docking station , I guess . industrial designer: Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th  these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . industrial designer: So user interface: Are we gonna buy a  a remote control  when you can  use it ? marketing:  user interface: So  Yeah . marketing: Well , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . So project manager: I think it's  difficult as well , marketing: Or b project manager: but marketing: Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . project manager: Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . marketing: But how does scroll-wheel work here ? project manager: Then you will Or maybe you can  scroll . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ? industrial designer: If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . project manager: Yeah but I think that's That is a big advantage , user interface: So Yeah project manager: if we're user interface: Yeah it's a big advantage . project manager: But user interface: But  , it's project manager: Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? user interface: yeah . project manager: If you push it three times ? marketing: Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are user interface: Yeah . marketing: right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , project manager: Yeah . user interface: But if you push the teletext button twice industrial designer: What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . marketing: I think that's the case on most user interface: It's  One m  one b  , a few buttons . project manager: Ah that's not really that marketing: Well , that could be just  like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . marketing: But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , industrial designer: No . marketing: Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . project manager: I think if you make a good advertisement  on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . industrial designer: If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . industrial designer: So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button project manager:  yeah . user interface: But  , you can make a f quite a big  remote remote control for  just the same price as a small one . It's  it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think .  , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ? marketing: Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design . Yeah I'm ag marketing: I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote . project manager: So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , user interface: Yeah . project manager: No , but I think marketing: So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . project manager: I think the most user interface: But they know the scroll-buttons from  old radios . project manager: We can let l user interface: So maybe it's  project manager: We can stick it out , a bit . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and  But we will see . marketing: Five more minutes ? project manager: No we've got fifteen minutes but marketing: Okay . What ? marketing: 'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . Innovative ? What new functions are there ?  , easy to use ?  , learnability is a very important factor here .  , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions  among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost . If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? And So we're supposed to evaluate it right now . Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . marketing: Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? project manager: I think it's fancy . Sh marketing: I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . project manager: So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ? industrial designer: user interface: marketing: Should be do-able . project manager: Is it functional ? industrial designer: marketing: Is the design functional ?  , do we have all functions that we want to include ? project manager: Yes . Oh , and do we  take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and R_S_I_ influences ? user interface:  m industrial designer: we haven't thought of that one . marketing: Are the production costs within the preset limits ? industrial designer: marketing: Well they are now . project manager: No I think with our new radio button , I think it's  I think it's better . marketing: I think project manager: I think it marketing: I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control . I was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this . marketing: Is this Like after this , are we done ? Or project manager: N We've gonna We're going to evaluate it . project manager: What is it ? marketing: Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here . industrial designer: Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance  marketing: Yeah , true . Was it clear what everybody had to do  according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you two of you with the  last phase ? user interface: So industrial designer: Yes , was okay . industrial designer: The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy . Were the means sufficient for the tasks  we had to do ? Or were they too much ? user interface:  . industrial designer: Well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but The digital the digital pen is very nice . industrial designer: A flip-over or a more precise  digit user interface: A flipper's  easier , so Yeah . user interface: But if you want to share  of  when you make  a picture like this  on the presentation , it's easier to  share it with  other people . user interface: you can sh save it  and  put it on the internet , or   in shared f  folder or  sh  shared directory . marketing: Yeah , user interface: So So marketing: I tried to open the file on my laptop , user interface: Yeah ? No ? industrial designer: No . project manager: But I think you can user interface: T can  can you export it  like a Yeah . Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? Or user interface: yeah maybe   when we n  just  give the numbers of of    o one of  out of s  sev project manager: Yeah . user interface:  it's  easier to  to do the th things that are like that on a computer . project manager: But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well . project manager: Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , still I think  if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . project manager: So you can also try to  reach the younger people by  putting fancy covers on on the market . marketing: Yeah , I think then it would be way more  popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . I didn't get a message from the from ending of the user interface: I believe y  project manager: Oh I think I have one now . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: marketing: project manager: Export as picture , I think . So  project manager: Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents marketing: Yeah , it probably will . marketing: Oh yeah , you're supposed to make a final project manager: And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . marketing: Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? user interface:  maybe we have to fill  another questionnaire <doc-sep>It's not as  interesting as it should be because we just  had the meeting , marketing: project manager: but I'll show them . I've put a f  a file in the project management folder , which says exactly  what kind of decisions we should take .  this because of our last model was very functional , but it  people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . project manager: marketing:  such as an  L_C_D_ screen ,  speech  acknowledgement , as we  talked about earlier . marketing: So we have to have  something like that , like we  project manager: L_C_D_ and our  our fronts . industrial designer: Easy to use ? project manager: Well , easy to use  s is a bit  contradictionary with the first  marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: I think that's your ta user interface: project manager: Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . industrial designer: you can make a very complicated   remote anyway , so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device . But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that's real great  great concept . project manager: user interface: marketing: The group we are targeting is  very pleased with fruit and vegetables . industrial designer: marketing: So we we we might cons consider in front of  in in that sort of  way . project manager: Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . And the materials ?  I have heard several things , so I  I'll have to change that on the way . project manager: Well maybe it it it is , industrial designer: We should move to  something project manager: but it doesn't look strong . Y Hard plastic i is of course  pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look .  it's   generally the case that  senior and wealthy people above  forty five years old  like , as you said ,  particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . industrial designer: And then we have  young  and dynamic  people , which is of course our  group , the people we aim at . Soft materials is of course  agai again a bit a contradiction with  our  material choice of what you said , that  it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . And if  also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as  discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But  since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that . project manager: Sports  , they're  that  are accessible on on your L_C_D_  window  user interface: Soccer fronts . project manager: All the results ? industrial designer: Well I also have  several examples of  styles , marketing: We keep coming back to the fronts . industrial designer: It looks like Well you know  you recognise the shapes , project manager: industrial designer: it's very primary colours ,  bright colours and  round shapes . project manager: industrial designer: You also  see  this device , it's not very round and Fruity of course . industrial designer: So to give you an idea of  marketing: Well it's got a strong look , this . Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look . Well we have to make a project manager: Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . I don't think that's very practical , project manager: No , it isn't . industrial designer: Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more  does make it looking a lot more stronger . industrial designer: 'Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong , marketing: Yeah but the industrial designer: becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but marketing: But it doesn't have to look strong . project manager: So , if you ti industrial designer: Well user interface: And it it doesn't have to be strong , also . project manager: Well marketing: Nah yeah the feel project manager: You you Maybe you should have  some some coloured titanium or something . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of  sun . marketing: industrial designer: And  kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for  for a simple remote , marketing: industrial designer: that's a bit , oh , that's a bit  That's a bit  much . If you use the curved case ,  a curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium . project manager: What do you exactly mean with double curved ? industrial designer: Now  this  to give it a more modern look . project manager: Double curved ? industrial designer: I'll draw it , project manager: It it mean user interface: Yeah . marketing: industrial designer: And it makes  it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have  . No  otherwi  no  difficult scroll things or some  things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . And ,  as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or   speak  speech  controlled device . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we  we do have to consider  of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But It's worth the trouble I think , project manager: Well user interface: The buttons can be made of an  a soft material . project manager: marketing: user interface:  there are new developments in speech recognition  systems ,  and they are already being  used on  coffee machines . user interface:  it's not really speech recognition , it's more  like you can  talk to the chip ,  record the message and record an answer , and then once you  talk to the remote , then  he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded  hi Mike back , then you will get that . That's a bit  user interface: But i it's just a marketing: But that that makes it cheap . marketing: It's it's just a an extra function , project manager: But it has no functionality for our remote at all . user interface: No marketing: No but user interface: but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . user interface: Well , as I said  earlier I think the  L_C_D_ screen should be  positioned at the lower end of the remote . project manager: user interface:  the buttons for screen width and general settings and  and that kind of stuff marketing: user interface:  we can also do let that kind of functions  be shown in the L_C_D_ screen ,  instead of  extra buttons . project manager: So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? user interface: I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that .  the buttons  should be positioned  positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . And  I drew an example , industrial designer: user interface: but it did not work quite the well  the way I wanted it to do . user interface:  ? Well I have the I can draw it again , industrial designer: Can you draw it now ? user interface: and I know what I did wrong . marketing: How do you   give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? user interface:  with the  the up and down and and well buttons and the marketing: Alright . industrial designer: Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? user interface: Yeah just  the numbers . industrial designer: And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? user interface: These these will be bigger in the the real design . user interface: This must be the Okay button used to  interact with the L_C_D_ screen . user interface: And with this you can  , yes , go to through the menus project manager: Yeah . user interface: and that can  the video button should be  an apart button , marketing: You've project manager: Yes . project manager: And what's the menu button ? user interface:  it's marketing: And you you need a you need a speaker . user interface:  ? marketing: For the user interface: This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus industrial designer: project manager: But how did How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah . user interface: Well we we can add another button here , but project manager: Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . project manager: Yes , well but bec because when you push Menu you get in , industrial designer: Yeah ? Yeah ? project manager: and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . That's you you should have  user interface: No no , we we we should  add  a extra Menu button industrial designer: No . project manager: Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s  window an option Get Out . user interface: Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: marketing: Or don't user interface: if we decide to  to implement that , maybe we should . industrial designer: Why would you put it  then , and where is the recording  the microphone ? user interface: Well they that could be anywhere . user interface: Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same  little hole thingy . industrial designer:  but  we could  d do , but it's perhaps more expensive ,  the speaker on the back or something . user interface: Well i  there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be  very expensive . And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better  at the lower end , or at the bottom . project manager: Yes ? user interface: You can  But I did not like it very much , but marketing: user interface: Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . user interface: No , well th marketing: Nei They're n they're not trendy . user interface:  this is for children but th industrial designer: Tho Yeah those marketing: It doesn't look strong . user interface: W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to . industrial designer: But it it must not look too childish of course huh ? project manager: It's it's all too much buttons . I think we should , if it's  possible ,  one with colours , but marketing: Nah th It's too expensive . user interface: I don't know  project manager: Well , that's too expensive I think . project manager: It still has t marketing: You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is . user interface: Well marketing: I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with  the round  thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . It's just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very nice . All the the materials from the case ,  the electric cable that's all your  your side of the story .  now from the user interface , your  package ?  where No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . marketing: Materials are the most , most impor project manager: So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good .  so if we  go through them industrial designer: Copy paste  this story into a into a Word document , and then  put the answers after the subjects . industrial designer: Well we have to decide all these things ? user interface: Yeah but all these examples are  of a coffee machine . project manager: Yeah well  Why should I  industrial designer: W we can  override them ? marketing: project manager: Yeah .  I suggest Well what do I suggest actually ? project manager: What what kind of properties should it have ? Well we just listened . user interface: Why don't we  use  titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the  the the whole remote except the front . industrial designer: Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , user interface: Yeah . user interface: And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . user interface: Well any colour industrial designer: According to my sources ,  it's it's totally possible to make an entire    Titanium is available , and  we can  make  an entire remote out of it , if we want . marketing: So , we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? project manager: I've  user interface:  . project manager: So material ,  hard plastic for the front ? industrial designer: Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back . marketing: But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . industrial designer: Well but marketing: You know ? industrial designer: The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah , i it doesn't  curves . Titanium is very No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . industrial designer: And even if it does  doesn't match , it will  People like  colours that don't match . industrial designer: Excuse me ? marketing: user interface: The electrical cable  does industrial designer: project manager: It's  from  our coffee  industrial designer: Yeah copper i just a ba basic  user interface: No we don't use an electrical cable . industrial designer: Yeah in project manager: industrial designer: Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of  project manager: Of course . project manager: Well  marketing: project manager: all the all the inside work of our remote is  standard work . user interface: and I will  project manager: Well you can put that in  into the shared folder , user interface: The shared folder . And what do we ? user interface: project manager: We thing that fruit and bright colours are industrial designer: Yeah the the the front w marketing: I think we can launch a couple of packages . marketing: Yeah but if you if you launch  five different packages like iPod mini user interface: Yeah , right For the  initiative  launch . project manager: We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time . user interface: Well you can you can give them  s s three or so , industrial designer: The most boring fronts possible . industrial designer: Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , project manager: Yeah . user interface: Red red , blue and green you give them or something , industrial designer: and and  marketing: Yeah .  this fruit and bright colours , yeah well I think we'll have to in the next  half an hour , we'll have to  s s specify the different  types we want to launch , when we  well introduce our remote . industrial designer:  we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design . project manager: Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get Where is my mouse ?  where is my mouse ? industrial designer: marketing: Lost my mouse . industrial designer: How Yeah yeah , but how do I user interface: But bu we stay we stay here or something ? project manager: Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think . Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it marketing: You can take the SMARTboard . And take it to our rooms and  project manager:  so you can  you you are going to make a prototype , and y Well that's includes  specifying the buttons etcetera .  well you will go and do something else  on the project user interface: industrial designer: Some Some non functional tasks . project manager: what are you going to do ?  I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but  you'll get  the specifications . user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No but project manager: How long do we still have ? industrial designer: Well , can we talk about something else ?  project manager: Yeah .  industrial designer: Yeah ? user interface: Will we use  round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? industrial designer: Round I think . user interface: And these  these s these buttons  are more  triangle-ish shaped project manager: Why does marketing: Curvy . industrial designer: But now I see the marketing: And this must be  volume I think , project manager: Heh ? marketing: and this programme . project manager: We can't get user interface: Well most of the time  up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think . user interface: Yeah , it depends , but If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up . industrial designer: Well we  We we j we'll just give them an  marketing: Yeah , that's right .  industrial designer: project manager: So what are we going to do ? I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue .  I think  a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be project manager: Also the slogan ? On the industrial designer: Yeah , why not ? If there's enough space , you can put  user interface:  I I'd say only the logo . project manager: And well you c On the back , you can put  h At the bottom , you can put the logo with the industrial designer: Right corner , or maybe here in the middle ? user interface:  the text ? project manager: Yeah . user interface:  yeah , at the back ? marketing: But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . industrial designer: Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , project manager: Yeah well marketing: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , user interface: Yeah , but then you must  really  yeah push it in or something . industrial designer: I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . user interface: industrial designer: But am I the only one , or  user interface: Yeah , on the backside . industrial designer: No not on the front , user interface: On the back Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , industrial designer: but on the backside . industrial designer: I think it's a nice idea , to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan . project manager: Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo industrial designer: But we'll  we'll take that  with us into the design . industrial designer: Do you do you see a bit of the of the  of the  titanium ? O on the front ? project manager: Five minutes left . industrial designer:  maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , user interface: Yes we could industrial designer: the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that user interface: No , they have two fronts , marketing: No no no no . industrial designer: This enti entire bottom ? marketing: Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ . user interface: No , you can you can just And then not a straight line but  some sort of wave or something . industrial designer:  it's  marketing: Yeah , project manager: What ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: That's a bit too much , but project manager: No that's nothing . project manager: Well I think we can , I just It's marketing: It's not relaxing . project manager: Yeah , o user interface:  the fourth one is empty , isn't it ? marketing: project manager: Oh user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: You have to empty one huh ? project manager: Oh , we have a one . marketing: industrial designer: What are you doing chief ? project manager: So , you can  draw a Yeah . user interface: Yeah I think we have to wait ? industrial designer: Yeah project manager: Well I'll get a I'll get the message . marketing: No user interface: industrial designer: But I don't  Do we have to stay here , marketing: project manager: No , I think  industrial designer: or I think we have to return first . Well we have  b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too , marketing: You just have to push harder . industrial designer: project manager: We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but industrial designer: But  th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so marketing: No . project manager: Well , that's not bad , is it ? industrial designer: Well they  marketing: No . project manager: So is it user interface: Yes , but you you get really close to the screen with your hand , industrial designer: user interface: and I don't think that's industrial designer: marketing:  . user interface: industrial designer: Where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah . industrial designer: Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it  goes off again . Alright now we know what to do , so user interface: We'll stay here ? project manager:  marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ? project manager: No , get away <doc-sep>project manager:  for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about  the work for each one . user interface: project manager: And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . project manager: and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . industrial designer: So  Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder project manager: Here . project manager: industrial designer: Right , so  I will talk about the the w working design and user interface: F_ five . industrial designer: And  well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve  what we want to do . user interface: industrial designer: So   I'm thin  I think  I I'll do a survey about what is  what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . Then  I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see  with  h how this little box would  look look like . user interface: industrial designer: And how an and we can  start troubleshooting first  com communication problems or things like that . user interface: industrial designer: And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or  things like that . Okay so can you go down  So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired user interface: project manager: industrial designer: so  I think we u we can use a battery for the . And the communication with the T_V_ set is  made through  infrared communication So  this is the the schema of the o of the future  remote controls user interface: Did you draw it ? marketing: project manager: Wow . industrial designer: so  you can you can see the components ,  battery and  the two chips goes to the infrared  connection to the T_V_ set . industrial designer: The one on top is for the  well the functionali the functionalities user interface: marketing: One is a communication . industrial designer: and the the th red  sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together ,  f transform the data into  qu into the format to to  to communicate with the T_V_ set . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t user interface:  . What is F_P_G_A_ ? industrial designer: It's field programmable  something array . user interface: So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? industrial designer: Well ,  a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can  you can pr programme it  wi with wh whatever you want . industrial designer: And  well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to  make the communication  between  the two devices .  So this are the they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice industrial designer: No . marketing: Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . marketing: Okay , and how about the battery power ?  you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? industrial designer:  no no no no , I think  we have  to to  have  embedded  b batteries in in the project manager: . user interface: industrial designer: And  I I don't think it will need  very  much power to make it run , so user interface:  . user interface: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? industrial designer: That's a good idea . marketing: project manager: Ma industrial designer: Also , but but I I I think  the the goal is to sell our remote control . So the the purpose is to to find  the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . user interface: and  and I found that  the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . user interface: For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . marketing: G user interface: So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors industrial designer: user interface: so can you industrial designer: project manager: This are usual functionality . industrial designer: user interface: But then  loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons industrial designer: project manager: And they are small . O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that  if I have hundred channels I have  I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number industrial designer: Yeah . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? industrial designer: user interface: And then we the speech recognition as  Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . project manager: What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ user interface: Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the project manager: than the industrial designer: So we have to t project manager: So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this . project manager: Yeah , we don't marketing: user interface: Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . industrial designer: I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because user interface: Okay . user interface: So i the processing on on the remote controller project manager: Yeah , user interface: so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? project manager: we . project manager: Keep the navigation industrial designer: We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so  project manager: but user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It's easy to build , user interface: industrial designer: it does not consume much power . marketing: Oh , but you have a catch there ,  assume that  if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . user interface: industrial designer: Well , then y you you go to the main menu and  you have  go to channel user interface:  . No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: but  I I think i i if you if you want to to make  well a a big jump but  well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could marketing: But project manager: So you are user interface: Ah . user interface: A mouse or industrial designer: Well , not a mouse but  something that that says more clearly that  right , left , up , down , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or marketing:    . So it'll beep if you wanna find it marketing: too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . project manager: user interface: you just  shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . user interface: And responds to you , and industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , that's right . marketing: Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . user interface: marketing: And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier industrial designer: Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to  make a speech recognisers runs on the small  ts user interface: project manager: marketing: An it does how feasible it is . I if you just recognise  numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary marketing: Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . industrial designer: And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without  adding  buttons user interface: Yeah . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , project manager: marketing: so this is an important criteria here is user interface: But project manager: But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . user interface: I no I I think that  i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with  reasonable cost . marketing: user interface: Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , marketing: Little bit more if it's with extra features . industrial designer: Well ,  project manager: There is in the marketing: for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . industrial designer: marketing: Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . industrial designer: we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or  well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so marketing: I think user interface: industrial designer: I well project manager: I think i industrial designer: it will be alright . project manager: What about lighting adaptive options ? marketing: Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think  not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . user interface: So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? It's very complex . marketing:  industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too user interface: marketing:  yeah , it's for the  industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . industrial designer: For our next product , our new T_V_ set with  automatical  sound adjustment light marketing: I think project manager: user interface: Yeah , then we can conclude that . So any things to to discuss ? Or any suggestions ? user interface: marketing: I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for  marketing . And regarding the teletext  these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . marketing: And  if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . industrial designer: marketing: So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . industrial designer: Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? project manager: I think we we can we is the . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think  about a way to to access the internet via the television . industrial designer: Because if user interface: Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand industrial designer: Yeah , but  we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . industrial designer: So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we  think about how to to to build up our remote  control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . industrial designer: So if we already have it in our remote control project manager: So you have to anticipate the the future ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible <doc-sep>industrial designer: Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ? user interface: Think we all industrial designer: You will as well ? user interface: Huh . I just wanna 'cause basically I can't re I've really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna rather than going  Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again . industrial designer: Okay I'm project manager: just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll you know . And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_ marketing: I am Reissa .  this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: I am your Project Manager , and ,  yeah , I'm just here to industrial designer: project manager: sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically .  right , this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is  I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . We'll we'll  talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all .  and then we'll , yeah , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it . industrial designer: How long is the meeting ? project manager: This meeting it's not very long . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . project manager:  if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . project manager: are you  b are you joining in with this meeting here marketing: I  yeah , yeah . project manager: or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just  doing some Internet shopping there ? user interface: Think she's finishing up her presentation . Alright , let's have  well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . project manager: I think the first thing we should look at is  probably the  what it is that it is actually supposed to be . project manager: You don't have to worry about screwing it in just industrial designer: Are we getting i Really ? project manager: there you go . marketing: industrial designer: So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so  I've oh no , you can't see a thing . So  the idea is that we've got the energy source  , which in our case will pr , oh well okay , never mind . So  I think maybe  two batteries , I dunno what they're called six , or something like that . industrial designer:  and then  then on the  remote control itself will have  the sender for the signal , which could be  an infra-red signal ,  which will be sent by an electronic chip . industrial designer: And  the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . industrial designer: Sorry the presentation wasn't very  clear but project manager: I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . industrial designer: should I erase this or project manager: Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down . project manager:  I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ? industrial designer: Fine . Or suggestions ? marketing: Is a battery like the only way of industrial designer: Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s user interface: Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or project manager: Yeah , you blow on it and i industrial designer: In indoors . marketing: No I meant like industrial designer: marketing: No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing   batteries can get like annoying . industrial designer: marketing: The battery's down and maybe , I dunno , solar charged ? industrial designer: I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but project manager: Yeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know . user interface: One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is  , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ?  , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . project manager: It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , user interface:  industrial designer: Well , the thing is  you you don't project manager: does it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . marketing: Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room . industrial designer: Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but marketing: How about Bluetooth ? Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth . industrial designer: Why not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more marketing: Isn't that a better signal ? project manager: Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . industrial designer: and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it . industrial designer: It's a fancy idea  it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , project manager: Yeah , exactly . industrial designer: you are gonna project manager: Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . industrial designer: But project manager: We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . industrial designer: Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't marketing: 'S just an idea . industrial designer: Do you need the border ? user interface:  I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint  . user interface: Yeah , and basically  , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at  already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with ,  what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design  . we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess ,  people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities  and and does the basics , but project manager:  yeah . user interface:  so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want .  so things that seem like absolute must-haves  would be a volume control ,  so up-down keys for that ,  channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and  a mute button .  one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing  some sort of lock  function . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this ,  freeze frame .  it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , project manager: Yeah . user interface: And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after ,  or the direction we were going in at least . So , the engineering centred ones  provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use .  and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person  , Reissa , marketing: user interface: because  we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . This w  research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff .  have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or user interface: No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I dunno , what  do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? project manager:  I would say it's If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be , user interface: Yeah . project manager: even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that ,  then yes , user interface: project manager: it's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , user interface: Right .  I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is  we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . project manager: You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . project manager: So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . user interface: Well yeah these , I think , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . Because we need user interface: I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here ,  . industrial designer: user interface: everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of   in the market , I guess . user interface: Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up . Well , for our marketing report  we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants  questionnaires to fill out .  total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings .  eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So , they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave .  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel . project manager: You are a child of technology , aren't you ? marketing:  so yeah  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . And it's easy to find , so I don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in  voice activating . marketing:  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . industrial designer: project manager:  but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't . project manager: It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and marketing: Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so project manager: People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . marketing: project manager: For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it .  but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , user interface: Yeah , that would be my guess as well . marketing: So they don't project manager:  d and tha marketing: Well project manager: and that's a that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent . user interface: What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ?  if if it's twelve fifty per unit . marketing:  also with  with buttons , a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense user interface: Repetitive strain  rep repetitive strain injury marketing: Huh ? user interface: or like from doing marketing: Yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . project manager: So y so it's so it's so you got user interface: project manager: so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of marketing: Yeah user interface:  . project manager: see have a look if  there's any w any medical background we can find out about this . industrial designer: Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a marketing: Yeah . project manager: Let's jus marketing: Maybe project manager: we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . project manager: I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , user interface:  .  okay , so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be , you know  , we're going for a basic television remote . project manager: Now going back to the  industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything ,  and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries .  mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . But a in there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . user interface: Yeah , it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page . Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? user interface: Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager . Do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ? marketing: Yeah , you can . I industrial designer: Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think . marketing: I think he's participant one , aren't you ? industrial designer: So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ . project manager: Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? marketing: project manager: . industrial designer: You have them i you have them , user interface: Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one , participant two . project manager: Send me , yeah industrial designer: You want to have friends , don't you ? project manager: yeah , okay . user interface: So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . project manager: Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit user interface: Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . project manager: Well , maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ? industrial designer: It wouldn't be user interface:  . marketing: Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col project manager: Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . project manager: It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product . marketing: But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction , project manager: There's loads of companies that called R_R_ . project manager: This is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . user interface: And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products industrial designer: Well you could project manager: as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . project manager: It's got to so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . industrial designer: It could come But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and project manager: Yeah . project manager: If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em <doc-sep>project manager: I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . user interface: marketing: user interface: That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . project manager: Are you ready ? Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now .  which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually  supposed to be doing , marketing: project manager: and who we all are and stuff like that ,  get bit more of an idea together of what's going on .  what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is  now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some  R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , user interface: marketing:  yeah , we're gonna hear your  th three little presentations , marketing: project manager: whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . Do you have any preference  of order ? project manager:  I'd like to  hear marketing: project manager: o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the  from from  Catherine actually first . I want what I'd like to hear about is  if we've finally decided on  what sort of energy we're gonna be using and industrial designer: marketing: Batteries . project manager: It's just that yeah , let's let's hear from you first . industrial designer: Where is that thing ? user interface: Okay , it's  marketing: It's here . industrial designer:  so  for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used  in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v project manager: I don't think any of us remember the fifties . marketing: industrial designer: You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . industrial designer: Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but user interface: Well , there's sometimes combinations , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . project manager: Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? marketing:  . user interface:  I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know . industrial designer: And  if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , marketing:  . industrial designer: For the case of the remotes itself ,  they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have  a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what  , so project manager: What's a double curved one ? industrial designer: You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . industrial designer: So  then the case material itself , so it can be   either plastic or latex ,  rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have  cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing  solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could  project manager: So that might be an idea of using the rubber , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but then it should , you know user interface: Let's have a squeezable remote . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , project manager: when a T_V_ programme's got one industrial designer: I dunno user interface: project manager: watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . marketing: I think rubber's project manager: Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ? marketing: But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more project manager: Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse ,  or you could have  L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . industrial designer: So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . project manager: Well , we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so industrial designer: So it's a constraint . Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . user interface: If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double  isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? project manager: rubble double double . industrial designer: No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , project manager: I'll have a Big Mac , please . And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why , but we need to go for  rubber push-buttons .  so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . industrial designer:  and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . If we get an advanced chip which is  used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . project manager: is  , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the  infra-red sender ? industrial designer: .  what a what alternatives do we have to that ? Y  what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? industrial designer: Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive  project manager: so it sounds industrial designer: Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . project manager: So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . project manager:  we wanna go for an i i all industrial designer: So let's not go for the project manager: so long as it works , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . marketing: What about the just developed  sample sensor ? user interface: I think push-buttons is project manager: What about what ? marketing: G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? marketing: I dunno . industrial designer: It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , user interface: Yeah . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and project manager: S user interface: Th the the speech recognition  option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us  , project manager: Yeah . user interface: 'cause  The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi  That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . user interface: it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , but it's not that . user interface: So , yeah , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , hello , how how are you ? marketing: Oh , then then project manager: Yeah . marketing: I thought I thought it was when they said user interface: Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's marketing: I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant  like , industrial designer: Channel five . industrial designer: Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . project manager: It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? project manager: We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? user interface: Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . industrial designer: Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , project manager: Yep , but we're going for the simple buttons . industrial designer: and that's fine ? project manager: And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it industrial designer: P user interface: Yeah . project manager: as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that  the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ . You industrial designer: I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a project manager: You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . project manager: It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . industrial designer: project manager: But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific marketing:  . marketing: Yeah , so they can sit there and go like user interface: Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . project manager: And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah . marketing: user interface: Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports .  I also took  Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration  , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as  what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . user interface:  and so the manufacturing division  sent some some samples of of  interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products ,  like the coffee machine . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ .  so yeah , they they also give the  they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . user interface:  so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_  you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . user interface: and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested  , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours  , the keys might be you know , funny or or , project manager: user interface: or  something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . You don't want  you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without  always pressing the wrong one  . And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of  , good layout and bad layout industrial designer: user interface:  from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so  project manager: Yeah . user interface: And so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page  . user interface: I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the  L_C_ display were were crucial for us . Well let's  so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? The  The the  the interface type we're going for user interface: So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think  . user interface: ideally ,  a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . user interface: Well now that we've decided on our project manager: Are we gonna hav hav an are we d marketing: project manager: have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something user interface:  it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , project manager: We're marketing: Maybe we can user interface: but  Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like  like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . Let's move over to user interface: I I guess the fact  also that we are having a rubber case  would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . user interface: 'cause  s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . user interface: But I think that should be   , I can speak with the button department , but  I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other  the other buttons from operating . Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets project manager:  yeah . marketing: and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to project manager: marketing: which we've already probably discussed . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . So it has to be project manager: Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? marketing: Yep . So project manager: What's that mean ? marketing: Technologically it should be like  work , basically , I guess . user interface: Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , marketing: Should user interface:  have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . project manager: Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . user interface:  it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . marketing: That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and  when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . marketing: Well , they do , but it's like it's not project manager: One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not . project manager: Okay , well , what do you two think about this ? user interface: So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other marketing: But like project manager: Yeah , what I don't understand what m user interface: electronics ? marketing: You could always insert , yeah . user interface: Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , project manager: Yeah , user interface: right ? project manager: and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television . marketing: Yeah , but , people like project manager: It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , marketing: Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . industrial designer: Well project manager: does it ? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . industrial designer: Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to   connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . industrial designer: No i user interface: Yeah , the that wouldn't be the remote so much , project manager: Yeah , user interface:  project manager: and i industrial designer: No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to project manager: Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . marketing: Well , it doesn't project manager: An and there is no there is no such thing marketing: Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery it could be something really really minor , you know , like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . marketing: If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and  just go creative . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . marketing: project manager: The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . industrial designer: Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . user interface: Yes , so can project manager: But yeah , by the squeezing it the marketing: I think , safety s user interface: Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So next year people will be buying , I found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs , industrial designer: user interface: Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a  and an avocado key on them .  and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is user interface: . And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls  like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . marketing: So we're moving in the right direction like project manager: Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , user interface: Yeah . project manager: so through all that we've we go we're right , we're gonna go go back to  going with the kinetic thing , industrial designer: Yep . project manager: that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , marketing:  . project manager: industrial designer: sued the Beatles so user interface: Okay , we'll make it a  pomegranate , a big pomegranate . industrial designer: project manager: Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally  agreed on is its image . Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , user interface: . project manager: or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? marketing: Well I think , if it's rubber it needs to be project manager:  you said earlier on i it should be funky . I think , it's it should be  , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like project manager: L keep it clean , keep it clean . industrial designer: marketing: Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ?  industrial designer: marketing:  like I'm just thinking bright colours . Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like project manager: Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? user interface:  . Tha user interface: The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having project manager: Yeah ,  we that's we we user interface:  if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato  remote . user interface:  what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? marketing: Well I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . project manager: marketing: And  parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's  like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but project manager: Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . marketing: So user interface: marketing: so it's rea it's quite project manager: marketing: it's quite like  user friendly industrial designer: marketing: and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something . project manager: So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different marketing: Yeah . project manager: so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the industrial designer: That's yeah . marketing: So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour wow . So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . user interface: Yeah  , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , marketing: It's  user interface: where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . industrial designer: Although I'd be curious to see how many  marketing: D you've got the industrial designer: You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour . project manager: Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , user interface: Right . Well  , we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then  is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design . project manager:  Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design . project manager: come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . project manager: We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's industrial designer: It is . project manager: you know now we can actually start , you know , s some sort of physical something or other . And I will be  industrial designer: marketing: project manager: talking to the bosses , basically , and  marketing: project manager: f fielding off some more spam and  industrial designer: Great . So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . project manager: we definitely know that  it's gonna be a simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . project manager: People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , marketing: Yeah . you know , we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have ? We'll look into this lock key user interface: Right . project manager: facility , although whether or not it happens , or is possible , I don't know , but something to look into . project manager: everyone know what they're doing ? 'Cause if you don't , you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it . project manager: It's  we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . But  I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together marketing: project manager: so bef before you all disappear off just user interface: Okay , I'll stay in here . user interface: Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that project manager:  I think , it's  , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: So we're buying fut  , we're getting futures in the company . project manager: Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . user interface: I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well . user interface: Well I I did notice looking at  , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable . user interface: if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious . Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black . project manager: And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it user interface: No "

        "Query": "What were Barry Hughes' thoughts on the legal framework, infrastructure of out-of-court disposals, targets for performance measures, and the registration of grandparents in relation to the childcare offer?",
        "Summary": "Barry Hughes believed that implementing a clear legal framework would provide clarity for parents and professionals, but there was confusion and ambiguity when it came to prosecution, leading to some cases falling into grey areas. He also suggested that the infrastructure for out-of-court disposals could be developed by the Welsh Government, the police, and crime commissioners. Barry clarified that they did not have specific targets for prosecution, but only pursued cases with reasonable prospects. Similarly, the police no longer had targets, except for certain individuals. Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the focus on registered licensed providers for the childcare offer, aiming for higher quality and a broader range of services compared to individual childcare. However, it was noted that some grandparents who were registered, licensed, and inspected also cared for their grandchildren and other children in small groups.",
        "Article": "We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag? huw irranca-davies am: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding\u2014we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the\u00a0seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one\u2014that's in Blaenau Gwent. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out. hefin david am: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that? huw irranca-davies am: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have\u2014and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there\u2014one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler. hefin david am: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020? huw irranca-davies am: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not\u2014and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out\u00a0to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within\u00a0densely urban areas,\u00a0where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd\u2014the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer.\u00a0Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course\u2014in short order\u2014as well. So, we\u00a0have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020. hefin david am: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for\u00a0the services is not spread evenly across? huw irranca-davies am: Absolutely. hefin david am: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales? huw irranca-davies am: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that\u00a0there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. We're not finding a problem here\u00a0with capacity,\u00a0whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision,\u00a0whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding\u00a0that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of\u00a0the well-known ones\u2014and I've spoken\u00a0about\u00a0this before\u2014is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a\u00a0family tradition of doing childcare\u00a0within\u00a0the families. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered,\u00a0unlicensed childcare of a sort. So, some of the aspects are cultural, but what we're also doing\u00a0alongside this, whilst looking at the capacity and looking at how we\u00a0learnt from the pilot roll-out, is that communication with\u00a0parents and providers and local authorities as well. It's about communicating what the offer is, how\u00a0simple it is to get invovled in this and\u00a0where they go to, and, critically, I think, how we do that national roll-out would be important as well. hefin david am: So, given the point you've made about\u00a0grandparents and family, wouldn't it be sensible, then, to offer a subsidy to\u00a0grandparents to provide this kind of care? huw irranca-davies am: Unregistered grandparents? hefin david am: Well, through some kind of analysis of that. huw irranca-davies am: Well, we don't think so and there are good reasons behind this. hefin david am: Is it because you say that they wouldn't be registered as\u00a0carers for their own family member? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but there's a deeper reason behind that\u00a0registration as well. The childcare offer isn't only to just provide childcare; it's the wider aspects\u00a0that come\u00a0with this.\u00a0This childcare offer ties into\u00a0the foundation years offer. There's an element of education linked to the\u00a0childcare offer\u2014there's that 10\u00a0hours of the early education foundation years as well. So, there's an issue here with quality, about socialisation and how children learn in an environment, as opposed to purely\u2014as great as all our grandparents and aunts and uncles are\u2014simply child-minding. So, the\u00a0focus of this scheme is very much on registered\u00a0licensed providers, which could be, by the way\u2014because we do have them, and we're discussing this at the moment internally and with the\u00a0Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years\u00a0and others\u2014grandparents\u00a0who are actually registered and\u00a0inspected by the care inspectorate? We're having\u00a0those discussions. hefin david am: How many of them are there? huw irranca-davies am: We don't think there is a huge number, but we're trying to\u00a0bottom this out at the moment. We haven't got\u00a0the exact number, but we don't think they are huge numbers, but there are, in our constituencies, registered, licensed, inspected grandparents who look after other\u00a0people's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven, but also their own grandchildren. Now that, I would say to you\u2014and I know that Darren raised this on the floor yesterday as well\u2014is markedly different in the nature of it, because it's\u00a0registered and licensed, than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles. I say that as well\u00a0because we also get\u00a0people who will say to us, 'I don't\u00a0want to be paid for looking after my grandchildren; I look after my grandchildren\u00a0because I look after them'. hefin david am: And what about the view, given that you said that\u00a0capacity\u00a0wasn't an issue, of the National Day Nurseries\u00a0Association, which says that Wales has the most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain? huw irranca-davies am: I don't agree we have the most fragile, but the childcare offer gives us an\u00a0opportunity to make it more\u00a0resilient and more robust. We know from the\u00a0early piloting, and as we roll it out, that there is the immense diversity\u00a0within the childcare sector, and we're talking about\u00a0everything from those very small terraced homes that have been licensed and registered to take six or seven children,\u00a0to large, complex environments that perhaps\u00a0are on maintained premises within school premises, provided by a voluntary or third sector organisation. So, there's immense complexity and we know that that differs across Wales, and we also know there's immense regional variation in the scale and the type of childcare offer. What the roll-out allows us to do, backed by \u00a360 million of capital money behind it, in terms of capital development of childcare facilities, backed by a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare\u2014and bear in mind this is bolted in as part of our foundational economy approach as well\u2014that means, by 2020, we get to the point where we're putting the money into the capital development but also to the workforce development, because\u00a0in some areas we're finding it's not to do with lack of provision and facilities, it's to do with lack of staff. hefin david am: That's fair enough, but is it realistic to think that there's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product? Is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, I think it is, absolutely, because, again, what we're finding is we've got several things going on at once in terms of how we monitor and assess the development\u00a0of this roll-out. One is the work that we're doing on the ground with the phased roll-out, so we're literally learning live time, and I have pretty much weekly or fortnightly updates on how things are going, but also there is a termly update as well. We've also commissioned additional work from\u00a0Arad to look at this first phase of the roll-out that we've done to see what that tells us as well. But the feedback that we're getting from the childcare providers themselves, on the basis that we're now identifying where either the gaps in the workforce or the physical facilities are, is that, 'Yes, we can do this', because\u00a0we're putting the money in, we have the strategy for the workforce development, and it's not going to be the same in all parts of Wales. It's not as if what we're saying is, 'Here's what we're going to do all of a sudden\u2014flick a switch and we have a universality of the same type of provision everywhere.' So, let me give you one key example. Alongside this, alongside\u00a0the \u00a360 million capital fund, alongside\u00a0the workforce development, we've also identified a separate\u00a0strain of money into cylch meithrin. We're specifically putting money into developing that, and, in fact, the first one of those will be, from\u00a0that new tranche of money, opening up, I think, in September. They anticipate, as part of our big strategy with Welsh language development, we'll have an additional 40 of those by\u2014 jo-anne daniels: Thirty. huw irranca-davies am: It's an additional 30 by 2020, and an additional doubling of that in the 10 years\u00a0after that.\u00a0We can't take this for granted, Hefin. hefin david am: The last thing from me: the \u00a34.50 single national rate\u2014is there a danger that we might be creating a kind of EasyJet-style nursery provision where you get the basics but the wealthier parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because\u00a0of the add-ons? huw irranca-davies am: We really mulled over this a lot and discussed it, I have to say, not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities. The\u00a0first thing to say is the \u00a34.50 rate that we've set has been welcomed, and it's been welcomed because it's unlike the much more complex offer that's in England, where there's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it's added complexity\u00a0and confusion. hefin david am: Can I just ask there, it's been welcomed perhaps\u00a0in Blaenau Gwent, but has it been equally welcomed in Cardiff? huw irranca-davies am: No, because\u00a0we haven't rolled it out in Cardiff yet, and that is a salient point. But will it be, then? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, it will be. Some of the more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport are knocking on our door saying, 'Please can we have this offer?', and we are keen to give it to them. But, as I say\u2014 hefin david am: But do you anticipate\u00a0a capacity\u00a0problem with the \u00a34.50 in those areas, compared to, say, the Cynon valley? huw irranca-davies am: We can't anticipate\u00a0it yet,\u00a0Hefin, but that's exactly the reason\u00a0for going into that area and then assessing how it works. We're reasonably assured by the feedback that we're having that the \u00a34.50 might work as a universal amount. But if we learn, when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport, that there needs to be some variation, we can look at that, because we're not doing a big-bang approach. So, that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it, but at the moment, I have to say, the \u00a34.50 amount has been welcomed\u2014it's appropriate. You touched on the other aspect, though, of the wider aspects of beyond the \u00a34.50, because\u00a0the \u00a34.50 doesn't cover everything.\u00a0The \u00a34.50 is a contribution\u00a0towards the wraparound childcare element but it doesn't cover\u2014and we agonised over this\u2014the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this. Now, we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are. I have to say, this hasn't been ivory-tower stuff; it's been in discussion with the providers but also parents.\u00a0One: parents are quite used to\u2014with childcare settings and play care settings and so on\u2014the idea that providers are quite different. Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents\u2014and I'm used to this as a parent myself, although mine are older now\u2014'Mr Irranca-Davies, when you sign on, just to be aware, if we do take your kids down to St Fagans, there's going to be a little bit of a charge for that' and so on. hefin david am: That's fair enough, but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that, because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons, the lower income ones won't. Isn't that a concern? huw irranca-davies am: If money was absolutely no object, then I think you'd be looking at quite a different offer, but it has to be affordable within what we've got as well. The fact that parents, including those who are on lower incomes, are used to currently discriminating between providers, not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well, where very often schools now will say, 'We're doing something extra'\u2014 hefin david am: That may be the case, but it's not fair, is it? huw irranca-davies am: In a pure argument about equity, and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money\u2014'You can do what you want'\u2014I think you'd be looking at a very different approach. But within what we have, I think this works very, very well indeed, because it's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions. But\u00a0within those additional hours, you may be with a local provider in the middle of Powys that actually says, \"Within that we provide everything\"; you may be with a provider that says, \"Well, actually, we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips, but it's up to you if you want to come, and here's the additional cost\u2014\".' Parents are used to making that decision and realistically, in terms of what we can do with this offer, this is actually\u2014the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily\u00a0disadvantage. In a total fairness argument, would you make it universal and with no additional charges? Well, possibly you would. But we work within the realistic\u2014 hefin david am: Or have a lower top-end income limit. huw irranca-davies am: Depending on how the Bill progresses in the main Chamber and when it goes through committee, there's that flexibility built into the Bill that those things can be looked at over time and adjusted. For the moment, I think there is an attraction, in terms of the upper limit, of saying: one\u2014'Let's try not to add additional complexity, let's go with a scheme that's already working its way through the system, which is, if you like, what they're doing in England, and not add additional complexity. But, secondly, there is an appeal to universality, curiously, in saying to all parents\u2014and I say this regardless of political hues across the committee here\u2014there's an attraction when you say, 'Let's make an offer focused on working parents as it is', as universal to those working parents as possible, and avoid the administrative costs of saying, 'Well, let's take the upper limit down to \u00a380 or \u00a360 or \u00a355.' There's always the question of how much additional cost is incurred in actually doing that tweak of complexity. darren millar am: Just to ask, the labour market costs are changing, aren't they? You've got the national living wage increasing\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014that's going to have a bearing, isn't it, on the affordability of this project in terms of the childcare offer and the suitability of the \u00a34.50 per hour regime? By the time it's fully rolled out, of course, that \u00a34.50 rate is going to be a number of years old, for example. Do you have plans to review that? Where is it headed? Because it's certainly not going to be enough in the future. huw irranca-davies am: It depends how far in the future you're looking. I have to say, the feedback that we're having at the moment from organisations like the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years and from the National Day Nurseries Association Wales and others is that this is the right rate and it's suitable not only today but for the foreseeable\u00a0future of rolling this out. darren millar am: But they've raised concerns about the national living\u00a0wage implications, haven't they, as well? huw irranca-davies am: Of course, and I think it's incumbent on us as well to not\u2014 darren millar am: So, it's not fair to say that they haven't raised concerns about the rate. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but what they're not arguing for at the moment is for this rate to be raised. darren millar am: But they have suggested that in meetings\u2014 huw irranca-davies am: That in future\u2014 darren millar am: Absolutely. huw irranca-davies am: Well, of course, in future, any Minister, any committee, will want to come back and look at\u2014is the hourly rate, as one element of the scheme, appropriate to the current financial challenges for the sector, and not least, by the way, as we try not only to develop the workforce, but to develop the career pathways through this as well? And I think that's the right discussion to be had, live time, as this is taken forward. But at this moment in time, we're not getting people saying within this part of the roll-out that we need to adjust this amount. darren millar am: So, have you forecasted\u00a0for any adjustment in the rate going forward in terms of affordability of the project? Because\u00a0you've still got this \u00a3100 million price tag on it, haven't you? huw irranca-davies am: Similar to the point that was raised with Hefin about Cardiff and Newport, if we identify that the rate is not appropriate, if it's\u2014. I don't think anybody's going to come back to us and say that it's too little. But do bear in mind that it's above where the average England rate is, even though there's this complex variability\u00a0within the English\u00a0rate that has caused some confusion there, which is why the universal rate with us has been welcomed. If we find, as we pilot it, or if we find because\u00a0there are more expensive areas for it to be delivered in, there needs to be adjustment, then we'll be back in front of the committee arguing why that needs to be the case. darren millar am: But that won't put the project at risk in terms of its finances? huw irranca-davies am: No, no. We are still very confident, looking forward, on the best projections we have, fed by the live input that's coming in from the pilot, which will be fed again in the autumn\u2014the Arad\u00a0report coming forward\u2014that we have not only the capacity to actually deliver this\u2014challenging as this is, we have the capacity to deliver it\u2014but also that the funding that's available, on our best estimate\u2014the estimate we've stood by, that broad ball park of that \u00a3100 million figure\u2014it's deliverable within that. And if it changes, I'll have to be sitting down with my boss, Vaughan Gething, and with Mark Drakeford, to argue the case on it. But that rate, combined with the other elements of this childcare offer\u2014there is sufficient there allocated to actually deliver the whole roll-out. mark reckless am: Minister, as a parent who's been researching childcare options, it's obvious to me that in Cardiff, and to a degree in Newport and Monmouthshire, costs are substantially higher than this, and I haven't\u00a0been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for \u00a327, which is implied by your rate. Isn't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you're going to need a higher rate to make it work? Isn't that already obvious? Why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future? huw irranca-davies am: Chair, my biggest fear is a parent who's actually involved in this area already, but, having been one myself\u2014. Mark, you may be right, that's exactly why we're piloting it and that's why when we pilot in Cardiff and Newport, we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability\u00a0and the \u00a34.50 per hour rate. mark reckless am: But you're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that I've referred to. mark reckless am: When are you starting? huw irranca-davies am: Cardiff and Newport\u2014September. The reason we've gone for the other areas first, by the way\u2014please take this back to any authorities affected\u2014is simply because we've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales, areas in north Wales, areas around Welsh language provision, areas in deep valleys, understanding\u00a0the cultural and the economic impacts. So, we've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision. But it's coming, it's imminent, and we'll learn the lessons from it. And do you know, you may be right? And if you are right, that it's more expensive, and we need a higher rate within\u00a0those areas, then we're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee. lynne neagle am: Just before I bring David in on the issue that Hefin raised about the chargeable\u00a0items, your paper says that providers can charge up to \u00a37.50 a day for food, snacks, transport and consumables such as nappies. Now, that's \u00a337.50 a week, which is a lot of money for parents, and I just wondered if you wanted to comment on that figure?\u00a0But also, do you think there's a risk\u00a0that providers who maybe aren't charging at the moment may start charging because of any new pressures that arise because of this scheme? huw irranca-davies am: I think they're the right areas to flag up, and if I thought that was going to happen I'd be concerned as we take this forward and design this scheme. I think part of the evaluation from Arad will also show us that\u2014whether or not, within the pilot areas that we are already in, which are quite diverse, that is happening. We're only one term into learning the lessons, by the way, but I would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families. I think also, by the way, that providers know that this is a collaborative effort to do this here. It's not in their interests, I have to say, as the umbrella bodies or individual providers, to see this as some way that they can unduly rake in additional income from this on the backs of poorer families. But especially, I have to say, the early evaluation that we've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts\u2014in the early evaluation\u2014are those who are below the average working wage within in Wales. That's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it, and we don't want them then being priced out because of add-ons. So, there has to be some pragmatism, I have to say, and some open partnership working here with the sector, and we do have that. john griffiths am: I want to come back to the \u00a34.50 rate, but in terms of working with the sector, briefly, if I might, Chair, I just wonder, Huw, in terms of that \u00a34.50 figure and understanding the sector in Wales, to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity? Is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate? huw irranca-davies am: This has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability, around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well. This is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says, 'Here we've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it', because we recognise that there's great diversity in provision out there, and we also recognise that things will change over time. I think we need to, as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out, continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the Welsh Government within the constraints that we have. Just to flag up one issue, it's right that we're focusing on those elements that aren't included within it, to some extent as well, and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families, but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well. Let me give you a clear illustration: some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well, it would add something like in the region of 50p to that \u00a34.50 rate. That would have, at this moment, impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it. I would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now, okay? But, it's that open dialogue with the sector that says, 'There's one thing about what you're saying you demand as a market; there's another thing about what we're saying that we have affordability from taxpayers' money to actually put into this'. They also understand, John, that as well as an enabling policy\u2014and we're seeing the evidence, by the way; I can cite it\u2014of individuals who are being helped into more flexible options to get back into work, increase their hours and so on, this is also about building capacity in a fundamental foundation sector that is in every single part of Wales. The sector itself understands that if we boost the childcare offer in all its diversity, including, by the way, not just the independent sector but social enterprises and third-sector organisations, such as exist in Neath and elsewhere that I was involved\u00a0in 20 or 30-odd years ago setting up\u2014that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well. So, it's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely, 'Our wonks have crunched the numbers and we've come up with \u00a34.50.' lynne neagle am: David, you had a question on the pilots. Before I go to my question, I want to come back to Mark Reckless's question and the answer you gave. I got the impression that if there is a need to look at different rates because of the higher-end areas, you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate. Is that also on the cards? huw irranca-davies am: David, it's possible. I think our preference would be, I have to say, to stick with the universal rate, because we know it's\u2014. One of the defining hallmarks of the way that we've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision. If we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas, then we'll have to look at that, but there might be other ways of splicing it. We might find, Mark, we might find, David, that we go in and when everything is tallied up, the \u00a34.50 per hour works in supporting provision there. If I can now remind you: I don't remember the word 'affordability' coming in the manifesto pledge of the Government. In the situation regarding Welsh-medium, you answered that a little bit earlier, but I have concerns about capacity. There's clearly a need to get more staff, because in your own paper you say that the report in 2016 said you do not have the childcare capacity in Wales at the moment. Do you believe that you can actually deliver the workforce to meet that capacity, first of all through the English medium, but secondly through the Welsh medium as well? Because there's a clear need to look at it. Do you actually think you've got that workforce capacity set up before this is fully rolled out? huw irranca-davies am: I hope, Chair, you'll appreciate that in our submission to you we've been very open. We have confidence that we can do this if everybody is working together across the sector, across the local authorities. Let me talk broadly about capacity, first of all, including English and Welsh-medium provision for children with complex needs, provision for children with disabilities\u2014all of this. The work that we're doing to increase both capacity in terms of trained staff and qualified staff: we have the 10-year plan that I mentioned, which has already been announced. So, we're identifying not only broadly at a national level where we need to develop those qualifications, but also at a regional, geographic level as well, and that's being taken forward. As you can see from what I've said before, it's rolling out progressively, but with all 22 authorities we're working with them on their childcare sufficiency assessments to identify where their shortages are. david rees am: What have the pilot programmes actually shown you about this, and how are you going to move this forward? huw irranca-davies am: Well, it's precisely that. So, within the pilot areas, we have a greater depth of analysis now of where both the workforce and the physical provisions are. Whether those are maintained or non-maintained or third sector or school facilities or whatever, we've got a much deeper granulation of identifying where that is, and we're working, then, with those authorities, with the capital moneys that we've allocated to this and the workforce development, and with local colleges, to develop the workforce and the physical constraints. But we're also doing that with the other 22, with all the 22 authorities as well, in anticipation of the wider roll-out. And by the way, it's not only the Cardiffs and the Newports; it's all the other ones where there isn't full roll-out. We're engaged with them deeply at the moment with that analysis on their childcare sufficiency assessments, both in terms of workforce, but also physical provision. It doesn't mean, by the way, that we exclude the third sector or social enterprise approach, or the independent sector, but co-location could be key to the roll-out of this in the right areas where it can be done, because then we avoid any\u00a0fracture between the education hours and the childcare hours: the physical transportation of children from one location to another. So, we're engaged with the 22 authorities on that: where could that be developed, who would be the providers that would do it and do they have the workforce to scale up to do it? If not, how do they talk to local colleges to do that? So, we're doing that at the moment. I mentioned we've put the \u00a31 million additional funding into the meithrin over the next two years, targeting\u00a040 new Welsh-medium groups by 2021, which pretty much coincides with the full roll-out of this. So, all of those things, David, give us a confidence that we're going to be in the right place. david rees am: But in particular, take the Welsh language\u2014I understand Gwynedd, and I won't ask another question on that for obvious reasons at this point in time\u2014but in some of the other areas where you've piloted, you've gone partial in some areas. When there's Welsh language education, and the three to five-year-olds go to schools, they go from all areas of the council, basically. They don't actually go necessarily from the local area, and therefore you're getting a different picture. Have you been able to assess the actual impact, properly, upon the Welsh-medium side of things? Because, for example, my grandchildren will go from my area, which may not be in one of the considerations, to a school that may be in that consideration, and that happens regularly. We know that historically we've got, across the country, a shortage of Welsh-language childcare provision\u2014meithrin and so on\u2014but we have not only a strategy in place, but the fact that we've got local authorities now doing their own assessments within their area, across the piste of childcare, but also in terms of Welsh language, that means then that we can start filling those gaps with the money we've put to it, and that includes in all parts of Wales, including those areas within south Wales and others that are less deep in their tradition of speaking Welsh over recent history, anyway, but where the demand for it is massive. So, local authorities are tasked with doing their own assessments of childcare sufficiency for this childcare offer. They're identifying the gaps, David, and we will work with them and with providers to fill those gaps, and that includes with the umbrella organisations for Welsh language childcare provision. And this does mean, Chair, that it will be different, as it currently is in different areas: the type of provision, where the provision is located. This offer won't happen unless the provision is there for those children with complex needs, children with disabilities, Welsh language provision, as well as more generic provision as well, but it will be diverse in its provision around areas. lynne neagle am: I do want to move on now, John, so if I can come back to your question. llyr gruffydd am: I would like to pick up on the last point, if I may. A question from me though, the wider question, is: how do we mainstream Welsh medium into childcare? Because, clearly, leaving it to meithrin is one way of doing it, but there's a lot of existing infrastructure out there that we need to upskill in terms of the provision of Welsh medium. So, it's not a question as such, but I'm sure you recognise that\u2014that there is a challenge there. Because if we are to get to where we want to get to, it isn't about growing meithrin, or Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin; it's about mainstreaming Welsh-medium provision within the wider sector. So, looking at the manifesto commitment that was made in 2016, clearly the main or the principal aim of this policy is around removing some of the barriers to secure employment for parents, albeit with very positive outcomes for the children themselves, and we don't ignore or neglect that at any cost. But I'm just wondering: how would you then reconcile that with the findings of the Public Policy Institute for Wales report, which I mentioned to you yesterday, which was commissioned by the Government to look at policy options in this context, which concluded that there will be no 'substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children' and that 'the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers in families with a child of target age is extremely small'? huw irranca-davies am: Well, the first thing I would say is that what we're learning from the pilots is that it is having real-life impacts on parents, including in disadvantaged families, and we're having this fed back from real-life situations on the ground, where parents are making different choices in the areas where it's being piloted. So, the types of different choices they're making could be to expand the number of hours that they're in work, because they now have a choice, they're not constrained to certain hours or whatever, they have a wider choice, with a wider number of providers, and they're making that decision and they're able to expand their hours. Some, by the way, Llyr,\u00a0I have to say\u2014and, again, these are real-life situations\u2014are saying, 'What we're doing is not expanding our hours, but, because of the increased provision of childcare and the increased offer, we are now able to actually spend more time with our children, because we're adjusting our hours of work, based on the childcare provision offer.'\u00a0That in itself, I have to say, is a worthy aim. But I would say what we found out, in real-life examples\u2014I'm not saying that in direct contrast to what that paper was saying\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: That's what I was going to ask; it sounds as if you're saying they were wrong. huw irranca-davies am: But what we have is the advantage of this phased roll-out, where we are learning, live time, and I think the Arad report in October\u2014we're hoping to see the final report in October\u2014will help put some flesh on this as well. It is already having an effect: the majority of parents who are taking advantage of this are actually in those groups that are below the average wage, they are making positive choices to get into this offer and to either expand, take more hours, adjust their own lifestyles around it or more. I can cite to you examples, because I've asked my own officials on this, of families who tell us they're saving up to \u00a3250 a week on the basis of this offer within the pilot areas, who've increased their hours of employment, who've changed their working patterns to suit their work life, but also to suit their families. llyr gruffydd am: So, in effect, you are saying that the PPIW\u00a0report got it wrong, basically. huw irranca-davies am: No, I'm not saying that they got it wrong and it's wholly wrong, but it is interesting, within that report, that it did identify that there were a range of factors here that play upon this. It's not only the childcare; it is the transport, it's the training and education, it's the employment support and all of those. And we agree with that, but we do think, and what we're seeing, live time, at the moment\u2014maybe at some point, somebody else will produce a report beyond the Arad\u00a0report in October that will say, 'Well, actually, the way this is designed, that they've done it in Wales, is having a material effect on those families, particularly the most disadvantaged families.' llyr gruffydd am: But you're asking us to support a Bill here, albeit a framework Bill, to achieve a policy aim where you're giving us anecdotal evidence that it's having an impact, contrary to research that's previously been done, albeit with promises that, maybe, an evaluation sometime in the autumn might tell us a different story. huw irranca-davies am: We know, and we are constantly told\u2014I'm sure this is commonplace in constituency surgeries, as well\u2014by parents who say that the biggest mitigating factor for them, actually, either going into work at an earlier opportunity or expanding their hours is purely the cost of childcare in front of them. I think our further reports, both Arad and as we go forward with the pilots, will substantiate this more. It'll go beyond the anecdotal, it will show that parents are having an enhanced opportunity to balance their work life, to make better choices, either in terms of expanding the number of hours they're working and increasing their disposable income within their families, or actually making it simply better for them in their family situation, where they don't currently have that offer. So, I get the fact that we have one report out there, but it's one report. It's a report, and we're not dismissing it entirely, but what we are saying is: we are now working with real-life piloting of an offer, and we are seeing the benefits coming through. As we roll this out, we'll be back in front of this committee saying, 'Well, this is now what we're finding. We can go beyond the real-life stories that I'm relating to you now, and we can say, \"Well, here's some hard data that goes with this, as well.\"' llyr gruffydd am: Okay. You reference in your paper, as well, another report, which is the\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0report, 'Starting Strong 2017', and it highlights countries that have, maybe, the most similar childcare offer to what's being proposed here in Wales. I'm just wondering what assessment you've made of those similarities, because, clearly, there'll be different economic contexts in different countries and different levels of public expenditure, et cetera. huw irranca-davies am: We haven't done really detailed analysis of comparisons with other countries far from Wales, but we will be doing work\u00a0that will be doing some benchmarking against, where we can find similar models, where appropriate\u2014do some appropriate benchmarking. What we have been doing is looking at what's been happening across the border in England and trying to learn from the lessons there, and also the offer in Scotland as well, which are both close to hand. But we will do some work, Llyr, around benchmarking against good comparative international examples, where appropriate. llyr gruffydd am: Yes, there we are, because one of my concerns was that the focus in a number of the countries in the OECD report are for nought to three-year-olds, whereas, of course, the policy focus here is for a slightly older age group. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, and I fully get that, but again, and I know it can be said, 'Well, this is an example' but it's real-life examples. We are having people who are telling us that they're now making the choice to go to work earlier because\u00a0this is extended to three-year-olds, but they would have delayed. There is a direct outcome\u00a0there if this childcare offer enables somebody to say, 'Well, I'm going to go a year earlier back into work and bring income into the family.' llyr gruffydd am: Okay. So, moving on, then, to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness, of course, which is an important one to address. Clearly, one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children, hopefully, later on in life. I want to come back to this point that the Children's Commissioner for Wales and others have raised: the concern that, actually, the most disadvantaged\u2014those from workless households\u2014are being excluded from this policy. Isn't there therefore a risk that they'll be left even further behind? huw irranca-davies am: I've had long, detailed and positive discussions with the children's commissioner on this, and I know the children's commissioner would want a more universal offer, but I make two points on that: one is, that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was, and it's not the offer that's being taken forward now. It is a different thing, a universal offer, and there\u00a0are issues around that with complexity, and also affordability. But it isn't the offer that we took forward into Government; this is what we're taking forward. I'd say two significant things on it: one is, this doesn't stand alone purely as 30 hours of childcare. Within this, there are 10 hours of the foundation years, educational input, which is there for everybody. But before that, particularly for those disadvantaged families, before we even get to that stage, you have schemes such as Flying Start, and I know this committee has looked in detail at Flying Start and has said that it would like to see it rolled out everywhere. If I had all the money under the sun, I would really do that, Chair; I would really do it. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but the fact that Flying Start, we know, is leading to those outcomes where those children, in quite challenged circumstances very often, are more ready to step up to the foundation year, are more ready, then, to step through into mainstream education in later years\u2014those things tie together. So, there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family, by the way, within this offer, let alone the childcare. That doesn't mean that everybody's excluded, but it does mean, yes, that this offer is focused on working parents. In fact, it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election, which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags, which is, 'I can't afford to go back to work because I can't afford the childcare. Don't tell me to go back to work, I can't afford it.' llyr gruffydd am: The majority of disadvantaged children don't live in Flying Start areas, do they? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, indeed. llyr gruffydd am: So, there's a missing cohort there that can't access one or the other, and the school readiness gap is growing, and, really, are we focusing our resources in the right place here? huw irranca-davies am: Well, yes, in terms of this scheme, but it doesn't sit alone as this scheme\u2014it's the wider plethora of, I have to say, progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in Wales that take different\u00a0forms. It's not only Flying Start that provides that other support for parents, and readiness not only for the parents and for their children, but also the support into work. So, if, for example, you look at the Parents, Childcare and Employment programme, which is separate from this, there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families. If you look at the support for the children, we've got the 10 hours that sits within the sphere of the education, but we've also got all the other family intervention programmes that help with socialisation, education and so on and so forth. If you look at this solely on its own and say, 'Well, there is nothing else there;\u00a0the rest of Wales is a desert and there's no support for parents, for getting parents back into work or for\u00a0those parents who are not seeking to go back into work but also need the support and for their children in education',\u00a0I'd be worried. But, actually, this fits as part of the jigsaw that we have in Wales, where I think we are well ahead of the other nations. Yes, we could do more, and I always say, Llyr; I always say, Chair, that if I had\u2014I don't have a chequebook at all, because it's not in my gift\u2014if I had a blank cheque I'd do a lot more, but we don't. But what we can do is get the right schemes in place, and if this helps drive more choices for working parents, including, by the way\u2014.\u00a0There are niceties within this as well; it doesn't have to be that both parents are working. darren millar am: I am surprised by the answer there,\u00a0particularly given that one of the ambitions of the Government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations, when they're 16 years old. Yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development, which could, of course, lead to a perverse outcome later on in life, but I don't want to ask you about that. If I can just very quickly ask you: has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they're in 16 hours or more of education each week? So, they may not be entering the labour market, but, of course, one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education, so what arrangements are in place there? huw irranca-davies am: Darren, we have considered it, and we haven't included it within the scheme because this is designed to enable parents to go into work, not into training to enable them to get into work. There are other forms of support available for parents in terms of college and so on and so forth, but it's not this scheme. darren millar am: But it's not prescribed support, is it? You know, it's not universally available to people who might be wanting to get back into the labour market over that barrier. You must have done some costings, then, if you've considered it, and you must have tried to identify numbers. huw irranca-davies am: We haven't\u2014 darren millar am: So, you haven't considered it that much, have you? huw irranca-davies am: We have actually considered\u2014. We consider it from the point of, 'What is this scheme set up to do?' It's very clear. But, very specifically, when you say you've considered it, what you mean is you thought about it but you've not costed it, you've not identified the numbers that might be involved\u2014 huw irranca-davies am: Absolutely, absolutely. darren millar am: And therefore you've not considered whether it might be affordable in addition to the policy objective that this is trying to meet. huw irranca-davies am: No, Darren, you're right: we haven't considered affordability because we've considered it on first principles to do with what this offer is trying to do. It doesn't fit within the offer so, as such, why would we do the costings? darren millar am: Perhaps I can frame my question in another way. Are you prepared to consider it if you're able to identify the numbers and potential cost? huw irranca-davies am: Ah, right, okay.\u00a0We'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee, but it doesn't actually fit within the first principles of what the\u00a0scheme is designed to do. Darren, can I just pick up on your point, in case you misinterpreted what I was saying to Llyr?\u00a0I drew attention in my answer to Llyr\u00a0to schemes such as the PaCE scheme.\u00a0In Gwynedd,\u00a0one of our pilot areas, they\u00a0are combining the Team Around the Family with this childcare offer. It is not the case, as you've suggested then, that there is somehow more disadvantage being heaped on other families. What this does is tie in in those pilot areas with the existing provision, and that's\u00a0the way we want to see it work. So, I wouldn't want you to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families. Those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works, and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme.\u00a0All families will qualify for the 10 hours\u00a0of education. In Gwynedd, they're wrapping the Team Around the Family with this offer\u2014 darren millar am: But on the other hand, Minister, you've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it, and yet not all kids will be able to access it, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. huw irranca-davies am: But all children can access the 10 hours, and they can access Flying Start\u2014 darren millar am: But 10 hours is very different to 30 hours, is it not? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but they can access Flying Start or they can access the Team Around the Family\u2014 darren millar am: If they're in a Flying Start area. huw irranca-davies am: \u2014or they can be in a children's zone area or they can\u2014 darren millar am: If they're in those areas. lynne neagle am: Right, I've got John and then David, and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief, please. In terms of child development and how this fits with wider\u00a0Welsh Government strategy, Huw,\u00a0I'd be interested in what you'd have to say about the quality of childcare.\u00a0We're talking a lot about quantity, but obviously we want to up quality, and that's recognised by Welsh Government. I just wonder how that sits within the \u00a34.50, because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there, and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place. huw irranca-davies am: John, you're absolutely right, and two things on that: I visited one of the facilities in the Valleys the other day that was taking this forward\u2014a very good independent sector-run childcare provision, with Welsh language and English language running alongside each other, and I asked the point about the integration, curiously, but\u00a0what they were doing was\u2014. Their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we'd want to see: not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects\u2014. So, it was hard to differentiate, in some ways, what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding, and including the nutritional stuff and all of that. Now, that is the model we need to see, and the \u00a34.50 seems to work, at the moment, for that. But the quality, I think, is key, and that's why we're focused very much on registered inspected providers, as opposed to every Tom, Dick and Harriet. john griffiths am: If we want to increase salary levels, though, which I think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality, then obviously that might impact on the \u00a34.50 rate. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, indeed, and we are cognisant\u2014. It's interesting that we focus on whether the \u00a34.50 is affordable, but the \u00a34.50\u2014you know, we're having an interesting discussion internally about how that \u00a34.50 offer per hour sits alongside others, such as the foundation phase offer, and it's more generous. So, I think it's: how do we align, as time goes by, the child development aspects of the whole early years stuff? Now, we're doing some fascinating work that I think I've referred to on this committee before about aligning the early years development entirely. Now, this is an evolving piece of work, but I think the childcare offer should ultimately fit within that. How do you make sure that every offer that is Government-funded works on child development? It's not simply childcare. mark reckless am: In terms of child development and not accentuating disadvantage, another area where this may apply is the kids who are born in the summer term, compared to those who are born in Michaelmas. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they start with a disadvantage at school and often don't make that up, even as they go through school. What is the rationale for providing the older children with five terms of this, compared to three terms for the younger children who already have the relative disadvantage? huw irranca-davies am: I'm looking to my colleagues here and\u2014 jo-anne daniels: Well, the criteria for eligibility for the offer are the term after the child's third birthday, which is equivalent to the eligibility criteria for the foundation phase early education offer. Clearly, then, the number of terms that a child is able to, or parents are able to, access the childcare offer will be influenced by when the child is born,\u00a0but I think you may be referring to a sort of parallel question, which is about whether\u2014. There have been questions raised about whether children who are summer-born should, in fact, start school in the term after they turn four, or whether actually they should be allowed the flexibility to start school at a later age, which I know is something that has been tested in England, and there is some mixed evidence about school starting age and the birth month of children. That's the compulsory school\u2014 jo-anne daniels: Well, that's the legal position, but, obviously, in practice, most children will start school in the term after they're four. mark reckless am: So, given the disadvantage we know that the younger children born in the summer have, relative to the older ones, why accentuate that by giving the older kids five terms of this project, which you tell us will have such positive effects on their child development, but the summer kids only get three? Doesn't\u00a0that make the situation worse? jo-anne daniels: I'm not 100 per cent sure I understand the question. So, children will stop being in receipt\u00a0of the childcare offer once they become eligible for a full-time school place, and most children will become eligible for a full-time school place in the term after their fourth birthday. mark reckless am: But the older kids become eligible for this five terms before they start school, where the younger kids, who're already disadvantaged, become eligible for it only three terms before, accentuating the problem, surely. Could more thought be given to this issue? huw irranca-davies am: We'll take that away. Minister, you got, or Welsh Government, really, got the Public Policy Institute for Wales to study this proposed policy and they concluded that it would have no substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children, and that the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that? huw irranca-davies am: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what\u00a0I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income\u2014as I mentioned earlier, up to \u00a3250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples\u2014but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do. lynne neagle am: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost \u00a361 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost \u00a3144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. , are those numbers really credible from PPIW? huw irranca-davies am: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks\u2014beyond the term time and so on\u2014carries advantages that are not picked up in that report. mark reckless am: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive? huw irranca-davies am: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of \u00a326,000 in Wales\u2014 it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. mark reckless am: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government\u00a0offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK? huw irranca-davies am: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England\u2014the tax offer is more integrated\u2014has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every\u2014 mark reckless am: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project\u2014people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by. mark reckless am: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria\u2014you have a \u00a3100,000 cap, as well as the \u00a36,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC\u2014will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the \u00a37.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, absolutely. owain lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay<doc-sep>Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands, and how do you think the law as it currently stands today, and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment\u2014how does that protect children. barry hughes: Sorry, can I just be clear? How does the law as it presently stands protect children? sian gwenllian am: Yes. barry hughes: We have a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, does provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. In respect of children in particular, you'll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. sian gwenllian am: Well, a review was undertaken by the Government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form\u2014that that would be the best thing to do because there's no evidence that it's not working satisfactorily. You are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that's happened since 2007. barry hughes: I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that. We don't need to go back a very long way to find, for example, that there was no such offence as raping one's married wife, and the law has changed to reflect the fact that that is simply not acceptable. And from what I've seen of the research, and I think back to the 2007 review, to which you've just referred, there is evidence within that review already that opinions are changing. And I've seen research more current than that that suggests that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastising a child than do people of an older generation. Of course, as we move forward in time, the people who are young now are going to be the older adults of the future. We have heard evidence as a committee that this proposed law would provide a much clearer legal framework\u2014that is, to take out this reasonable punishment defence, that then would make things much clearer for parents and professionals. Does the CPS have a view on that? barry hughes: I think it will make things clearer. I'm not sure it will make them much clearer, because if we get into some of the\u2014. And when it comes to prosecuting, it's often the case that things aren't just black and white; there are multiple shades of grey in between. We know that the Children Act did introduce a degree of clarity, in that it removed the defence of reasonable chastisement for offences of causing actual bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and various incidents of child cruelty under the Children and Young Persons Act. There were a series of Court of Appeal cases that sought to clarify the law, but that was at a time, at the end of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, when we had the European convention on human rights and we had a quickly developing body of case law. A decision was clearly made back then in the early 2000s not to include common assault in the same category as actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm et cetera. As we wind forward some 15 years, I have seen the research that suggests that some people see that the present legislation, and the way in which section 58 applies to reasonable chastisement for common assault of children\u2014some people have interpreted that as saying that smacking is acceptable. I don't think that it is what it says, but there is a degree of confusion around that. And the reason why I say it's not as simple as that is, going back to my words a couple of minutes ago, it's rarely a case of being black and white; there are these degrees of grey. sian gwenllian am: What are the areas of grey that you refer to? Can you give a few examples? barry hughes: If you take an example\u2014so, one of the examples that I've heard discussed has been a child\u2014a young child; let's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road\u2014who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic. Now, technically, taking hold of the child at that point is an assault, because it's an unwanted imposition of physical force. But no-one's going to say that's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts. At that point, the parent then seeks to admonish the child, tells them off and smacks the child on the legs. But so much depends upon the circumstances, whether this is something that happens frequently with the child, the size of the child, the parent, the force of the slap, the way in which it's imposed. As we move towards the other end of the spectrum, we might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. There'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police, and the police would take some form of action, and then, as we move through the tiers, it'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. And the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court. That would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that I've just described to you. Does that help to illustrate that, at one end, it's relatively white and the other end it's relatively black, but in the middle we have the shades of grey? sian gwenllian am: But that would mean that there could be more prosecutions at the softer end. So, you are probably aware, but forgive me if I just explain quickly anyway, when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is\u2014. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case\u2014the light smacking on the leg\u2014at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think\u2014and I think this is what will probably happen in practice\u2014that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. It may be that the police decide that it is\u2014it may have been two smacks, three smacks, so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious. We would then apply independently the same test, and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists, which takes us on to considering the public interest. In the circumstances that I've described, every case is going to be unique on its own facts, but in the circumstances that I've described, if it is just a light smack and it's a one-off and there's no history of this, it would probably be the sort of offence we'd decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. sian gwenllian am: But isn't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that? Do you know what I'm saying? barry hughes: If this Bill goes through, then it will remove a defence, which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the CPS than beforehand, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will refer it, because it will depend on the facts of each individual case. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in England and Wales from Dawn Bowden. The Assembly doesn't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the CPS, as you know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that? barry hughes: Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this\u2014and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing\u2014that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. The second example that I'll give you is that we already have within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example I'll give to you is this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 \u00b5g in 100 ml of breath. As you drive into Scotland, you're probably okay to drive if you've got 34 \u00b5g; by the time you get into Scotland, you won't be. And the consequences for you are significant, because of course it's an offence in Scotland, and not an offence in England, but the punishment, namely disqualification, applies everywhere in the United Kingdom. So, we already have a degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognises this. In our code, we have a specific provision that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that? barry hughes: Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, we would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences\u2014and we might want to get into the number of potential offences, but my take on it is the number of offences is likely to be very small and we would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that comes through goes to people who've got a close network and can talk with each other\u2014 dawn bowden am: And that would be primarily around the public interest issue. So you're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications. What's actually been your involvement with the Government as they've been developing this legislation? barry hughes: My own personal involvement? dawn bowden am: Or the service's. I met with a Minister and a Deputy Minister\u2014I met with Huw Irranca-Davies a little while ago, and I met with Julie Morgan a few months ago\u2014to discuss the overall implications, and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other. It hasn't been a very close-knit involvement, but we have had enough involvement so that we've felt we've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation. I don't feel that it's been too much, nor do I feel we've been left on the side at all. Now, we've just talked about the divergence of criminal law, and this is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance. barry hughes: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that. dawn bowden am: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales\u2014well, and in England, actually, across the border\u2014will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law? barry hughes: Not as of the present day. [Laughter.] dawn bowden am: But you would expect that to be something you would\u2014 barry hughes: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes? barry hughes: They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that. Oh no, that's right\u2014obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers\u00a0of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision? barry hughes: I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. What we would envisage is that we would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which are set out, in my view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and we would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that we're discussing here. And we'd need to work that up as we go along, and I think you'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse, if I may put it like that. suzy davies am: It's just that, personally, I think the public interest test is critical in all this, and it would really help us to understand what it could look like before we commit to a particular course of action in supporting or not supporting the Bill, that was all. sian gwenllian am: My point is about the criminal law in Wales and England diverging in this particular instance, and we've been told that this is probably the first time it's happened. Can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion? barry hughes: There are other offences in Wales that don't exist in England, but they don't crop up very often. So, to give you examples, there is an offence of putting an electronic collar on your pet\u2014let's not stretch that into children. But putting an electronic collar on your pet that administers a shock is an offence in Wales; it's not an offence in England. There are also offences around the picking of cockles in west Wales, which is not an offence\u2014. So, you can see there are some, but I would argue that the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England is possibly more significant for the general public. Of course, the topic we're discussing here is of real relevance for the general public, and you have heard evidence, I know, already, that comes from people who are quite strongly in favour and people quite strongly against it. One of the ways in which I've approached this is looking at it from the perspective of what the law is there for, which is to set out, in essence, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to use the law for that, but it signifies how society views a certain behaviour. I like to look at it from the perspective of the person who is being affected by this, namely the child, and the change in the law here would afford children a degree of protection that they don't presently have, but which they do have when they attain the age of 16.FootnoteLink So, I looked at this\u2014. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying\u2014but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. sian gwenllian am: Do you think that what we're doing in Wales will be emulated in England at some point? barry hughes: Well, it's certainly going through in parallel in Scotland, and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this, including a large number of European countries. Who knows? Trying to get any legislation through Westminster at the moment\u2014who knows? Not tomorrow, I'd say. Can I just begin by asking you to help the committee out here in understanding how the burden of proof is going to work if this defence is removed? Because the issue of whether something is punishment or not is going to disappear, providing that it's clear that contact with a child has happened. Is that going to work on the presumption that that's an unlawful contact? Is that something the prosecution will still have to prove, or will it be for an accused parent to say, to use your example, 'I was just dragging them out of the traffic or stopping them putting their hands in the fire'? barry hughes: I understand your point. So, if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement, in a sense that alters some things but it doesn't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution, which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And if the defence raise an argument and say, 'Well, look, that was a lawful act; I was only doing what I thought was reasonable in the circumstances', it's for the Crown to disprove that. barry hughes: And we've got to disprove that to the criminal standard, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. I can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter, to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial, and it would be our responsibility to disprove that. Obviously, when we're talking about CPS guidelines and all the rest, we've already come some distance down the process, haven't we? Have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest? Because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you're arrested, that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like DBS checks in the future, even if it goes no further. Do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on, even at the point of the knock at the door? barry hughes: From the perspective of the CPS, I'm not sure I can help you there. Unlike in many other jurisdictions, we have no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decide not to investigate\u2014. I routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something, and they want us to do something about it and we can't. suzy davies am: Thank you for that, because I thought that was important to get on the record as well. We're looking at a period of a couple of years after this Act passes\u2014if it does\u2014for implementation. Is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law? barry hughes: I think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we've built up with the Welsh Government and colleagues there. We have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and I believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected; that we can liaise, in turn, with Kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop. So, I think we've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose\u2014at least, 'adequate' might sound a little\u2014 suzy davies am: Sufficient. suzy davies am: So, you're confident, by 2022, then, that you'll have changes to the CPS guidelines that are good to go, if you like. Bear with me a second\u2014thank you very much\u2014in your written evidence, you did welcome the indication from the Welsh Government that this reasonable period after Royal Assent would be necessary. Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this? barry hughes: If this legislation goes through, there will be minor financial consequences for us and I don't see any significant financial consequences in the period between now and the Bill becoming law other than the time of ourselves in discussing this today. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will\u2014. Normally, we do this through our case management system, which is England-and-Wales wide, and you'd put a flag on. So, for example, domestic abuse, there's a flag for that, and assault on a child, there's a flag for that. Trying to get that through on a system that covers all of England and Wales\u2014it's quite expensive, unbelievably; it wouldn't happen. My take on it: I've seen and spoken with Matt Jukes about this, from South Wales Police; I have seen the justice impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever\u201412, 18 months, maybe 24 months\u2014where we'd look back to see how we are doing. And I'd like to think that we will be doing that in consultation with interested parties and stakeholders. So, for offences such as racially aggravated offending, whether it's criminal damage or offence against the person, we will bring together interested parties, by which  people from outside the CPS, quite often third sector agencies that represent vulnerable groups. That, in turn, helps us shape and improve the way that we prosecute these cases and I can foresee that, after this legislation came in, we might get 18 months, two years down the road, and I can see us sitting in a room with some of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how we're doing with it all. suzy davies am: That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example\u2014the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children. lynne neagle am: Before we move on, can I just ask\u2014? The Children Act 2004 applies to a child up to the age of 18\u2014 barry hughes: Sixteen. barry hughes: I'm reasonably confident that it's 16.FootnoteLink lynne neagle am: Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill? barry hughes: Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted. vikki howells am: Thank you, that's really useful, and\u2014 lynne neagle am: Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution? barry hughes: Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed. There is a body of law that\u2014 suzy davies am: A child can't consent to assault. barry hughes: Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option? barry hughes: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say\u2014for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth\u2014we\u00a0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering\u00a0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility\u2014that will fall to the police\u2014but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. One final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this Bill\u2014how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited? barry hughes: The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved\u2014the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction. vikki howells am: And who would build that infrastructure, in your opinion? barry hughes: Somewhere within Wales\u2014Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales? barry hughes: I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example? barry hughes: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here\u2014by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes\u2014if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it. sian gwenllian am: Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. It may be\u2014the sort of circumstance I can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'Prosecute me'. So, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in England\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. And do you think that that would be an isolated incident? barry hughes: Yes, truly, I believe, an isolated incident. I've said before that I would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures? barry hughes: I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets\u2014it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean. sian gwenllian am: What about\u2014? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence? barry hughes: I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. Is that going to increase if we change the law? barry hughes: There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication. sian gwenllian am: Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law? barry hughes: No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. sian gwenllian am: Finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point. How to approach that one? In the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the Government, the then Government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the European convention. If Wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, Wales would be more in compliance with ECHR than not, and England would be less so. But nonetheless, at present, I haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case I referred to, Regina v H, which was heard back in 2001 in the Court of Appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. sian gwenllian am: And that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the UK\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the European Union. barry hughes: It could, but I would be a foolish man if I were to say what impact European jurisprudence might have upon us. [Laughter.] suzy davies am: [Inaudible.]\u2014like common law jurisdictions would be. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the Bill will be of great significance to the Crown Prosecution Service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. So, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. What's your answer to that? barry hughes: There is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and I think probably about\u2014. From memory\u2014please never hold me to this\u2014but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. I've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant\u2014what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything\u2014that would be a nonsense\u2014or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. And then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise? barry hughes: No. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and I know that the Ministry of Justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. So, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, I don't think it would be a barrier. I think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it. Can I thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers, which have been fascinating and very clear and most helpful to the committee? You will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Business Committee requesting an extension on the deadline for the Bill, which has now been agreed. Paper to note 2 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services requesting some further information from CAFCASS Cymru on the Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Minister for Education regarding Diamond reform implementation ahead of our scrutiny session on 4 July. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "Query": "What were the Project Manager's thoughts on the conceptual design, symbol and colour, special button design for game players, shape, appearance, and buttons of the new remote control during the discussion?",
        "Summary": "The group discussed pricing the remote control at 25 euros, which was considered relatively high compared to existing options. To avoid losing potential consumers, the Project Manager decided to position the product as a universal remote control with unique features to attract more consumers and meet profit expectations. User Interface suggested designing symbols and colors for the remote, but the Project Manager emphasized the need to incorporate their own logo and color scheme. Marketing proposed self-intuitive buttons for game players, with Industrial Designer preferring a game control keypad over separate buttons. The Project Manager agreed, as keypads were common and user-friendly, allowing for easier navigation and joystick functionality. The shape of the remote was debated, with Marketing and User Interface suggesting an iPod square or a more innovative round shape. The Project Manager opted for a round shape with rounded corners to promote innovation. The idea of a multifunctional remote control was met with concerns about size and complexity. To address this, a touch screen remote control was proposed as a feasible solution.",
        "Article": "Right , my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , we have in the group marketing: Oh , Ebenezer Ademesoye . Would you like me to spell that ? project manager: yeah , marketing: S project manager: go for it mate . project manager: And you're going to be the User Interface , user interface: User Interface Defin Designer , yes . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more  detail than that , but  personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design .  , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . What can I say ? Ebenezer , you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal ? industrial designer: marketing: Sure . Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , industrial designer: marketing: and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant . So elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer . project manager: Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? industrial designer: . industrial designer: Do we take them off ? marketing: I think you ga industrial designer: Oh right , project manager: You should also l  have your the lapel mic on as well . Yeah , industrial designer: Now where do I put the marketing: Just  somewhere project manager: Yep , the , it's just across there , that's it . project manager: You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much . They're just they're big , they're biggest cats ,  I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and  it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was looks the best , the stripes , orange . My dad used to talk about he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when I was a kid . The one f  in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to  well my I have a three  three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . And  fr and from  from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but  cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and  , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . marketing: Oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , project manager: Yep . project manager: Well , fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? user interface: Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there   at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be  programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get  you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree    you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different  the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one  you know one macro to turn the  you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the  re  rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . user interface:  b it occurs to me there might be a niche for  for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . project manager: Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our user interface: Absolutely prohibitive , project manager: yeah . user interface: Yeah ,  I wouldn't like to say you g  you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could  operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . project manager: Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of user interface: For instance ,  let's say oh oh  , or  you know you pr  you press  say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well ,  project manager: Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea .  marketing: 'Kay project manager: Any takes on this ? marketing: Well  I've noticed that  gaming c is becoming quite popular with television ,  when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , user interface: marketing: but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar ,  keypad , for playing games . They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or  to record things . Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , project manager: Okay . marketing: and slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that's project manager: Yeah I've heard I've seen the bar-code design before , industrial designer:  . marketing: Yeah , it's it's taken out the Y you don't have to be  really clever to use a remote control . I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . project manager: marketing: you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that . project manager: we're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got a couple of ideas , marketing: Yeah . project manager: we can we'll have to work fast , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of  some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . project manager: And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out marketing: What the user wants  . Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ? industrial designer: Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? marketing: Oh . industrial designer: or is that a bit ridiculous ? project manager: I I don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . The other key feature that  that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . But of course ,  al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive  sha shape for it overall , . So , user interface: A curve , project manager: small , stylish , and something that's just a little different . Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form ,  which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway . I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've  kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody . project manager: as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here ,  unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us .<doc-sep>industrial designer: Should I bring my  pen too ? project manager: Yeah just yeah , no , industrial designer: Or project manager: that's for me , I just have to make some notes . marketing: Can you hear me ? Hello ? project manager:  actually my laptop doesn't work , marketing: Test . So  the thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things or , not yet , user interface: Yes . So  , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that's what we're going to design . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the  the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's  the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what  the market is doing for what kind of  remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is  the detailed design  and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . Okay so  no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the  f  s an introduction of that one . And you already saw you know all that that you here can put  things in the the red project  map . You have to  draw  a favourite animal on the whiteboard marketing: project manager: and  and say why it's your favourite animal . So and you have this is just to try it out and we have to  use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . project manager: I just h industrial designer: project manager: Something like this ? Oh no marketing: It look like a dinosaurs . project manager: Okay , so just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . Okay and then  what's the colour ? How do I do project manager: It's in format .  there has to be water , project manager: Just marketing: but project manager: No it has to be an animal , so if that's it's it should be a shna snake or something . marketing: Yeah yeah , but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . marketing: Okay , who next ?  project manager:  do you have to write down why  that doesn't matter , just it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay . project manager: Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that no , to the yeah . industrial designer: user interface:  industrial designer: marketing: A sheep ? project manager:  we d only have twenty five minutes , so . project manager: Just hold it more more to the back then you don't have user interface: No project manager: okay . project manager: I thought these pens would be just   you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? No , not yet , okay . user interface: Yeah , that's right , project manager: But it's just user interface: it but you actually got to write on the paper . project manager: Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in  typed words in Word , marketing: Yeah yeah , it's a real pen . project manager: so that's not user interface: Yeah , but it's just a picture . user interface: You really marketing: Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: I don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure . marketing: project manager: Oh industrial designer: marketing: project manager: this is definitely the best one . project manager: Okay , so  what we know is that we have to sell this  remote control for about twenty five Euros . And  we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to  use a big market in Europe . project manager: So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno .  so we're gonna have a little discussion about  what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls . marketing: Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ? project manager: Oh yeah , that's a good question . marketing: Because we sell it    lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it  apart . project manager: I think it's I'm not I'm not sure , marketing: So I project manager: it's not  I think industrial designer: Yeah , it probably would be universal . marketing: Because user interface: And only television ? Or more devices ? project manager: I don't think you can buy a a a universal  remote control for twenty five Euros , so not sure , but industrial designer: maybe , I don't know . marketing: Yeah , I know  you can buy a re a universal  control for  only twenty  Euros project manager: Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . industrial designer: And  also for the V_C_R_ and  D_V_D_ player project manager: Yeah , everything industrial designer: and project manager: just so a lot of buttons on the remote control . project manager: what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not nothing very special , but  user interface: Well we can try to make it special . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user user interface: Well marketing: Well I th I thought about  making it the same  style as the television , we don't have  the same television  all the time , so  that's no matter .  if we  control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it  it has to be clear , because  kids and  elderly are gonna use it , so  it's not only for the  technical persons .  I think it must be a very good control , so you can    act  use it from  everywhere in your room , the the infrared  thing must be from very good quality . user interface: It shouldn't be too big , marketing: I dunno  user interface: but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so . user interface: Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , marketing: Yes user interface: maybe more trendy . user interface: Fold open , project manager: Okay , user interface: where you can see  more options . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , industrial designer: Yeah marketing: Ah industrial designer: n marketing: that's that's project manager: if you just user interface: Yeah , something  on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . project manager: Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? industrial designer:  maybe be  it's it's project manager: There are buttons on it . user interface: But that's industrial designer:  like a a to have marketing: Yeah , but user interface: Yeah , I think it's much  too expensive . project manager: marketing: And we have to care for  the strength of the remote control , project manager: Yeah . marketing: because   remote controls are most  things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often  broken . marketing: Yeah and a lots   lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not  kids  project manager: No . industrial designer: And  how about the batteries ? marketing:  industrial designer:  should you put it in a recharger or a just project manager: Oh maybe that's a good idea , marketing: Ma maybe a home station . project manager: just to put it on your television and just s recharge , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think . project manager: Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive  is a normal recharger ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: Well  how much is your  standards  mobile phone recharger ? project manager: I dunno . industrial designer: Yeah , if you buy it  separately from your phone it's probably expensive , project manager: marketing: Ah yeah . marketing: user interface: Maybe have  marketing: project manager:  if you th look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive . marketing: Yeah , but a home station is  a really good idea , because  lots of people are  lose their remote control and don't know where it is , project manager: Yeah , that's right , yeah . marketing: Maybe it's Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive . industrial designer: Yeah , but I have a mouse that's   also  user interface: Rechargeable . industrial designer: Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , user interface: Yeah . marketing:  I I set something on paper already , size , looks ,  usable ,  the buttons on usable places ,  the the on off button must be on top , project manager: Yeah . marketing: you you have to  project manager: Has it be has does it has to b have to be   like a different form than a normal remote control marketing: Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know project manager: or user interface: Well I think we have to look at that , marketing: if we user interface: 'cause well you can do the standard way , but then you won't marketing: You can make it very special , to create our own  looks , project manager: Yeah marketing: but it's very hard to industrial designer: N  if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . user interface: Well you can  have  the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume  obviously on t on top , so you can see . user interface: But the rest is  you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . user interface: So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: And what we have to think about too is   buttons that you use often are  maybe  like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you can still  do the th the functions . project manager: Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine . marketing:  on on top are the the basic options on top , industrial designer: But n user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: yeah , but  i basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , marketing: and if you fold it open project manager: But maybe it's user interface: Yeah . project manager: maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very   what's it's called ? marketing:  . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an  the strength  is not s as good as a normal  remote control . project manager: Maybe it's hard t user interface:  project manager: No , that's right . marketing:  for m for me  the Marketing Expert , the user requirements  specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the user interface: No , what you want to do with it . project manager: Yeah , I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . user interface: Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff project manager: Yeah , user interface: that you want on a project manager: no maybe not not  , that's not a f that's something for for for yeah . project manager: what's in the market , what's normal ,  what kind of  buttons do you have . user interface: What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . project manager: For the next time you have to  put it exactly on the square , so your laptop <doc-sep>user interface: Why won't it wake up ? Is it on ? marketing: The power light doesn't work . Okay , so I just show you the m the no   the the the the the the minutes , minute . project manager: Okay , so we just talked about  Oh you want me to show that there or user interface: No , industrial designer:  no . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute  button , and a text T_V_ button . project manager: So I just want to give you  Mike again , the first  presentation of your marketing: Shall I start ? project manager: Yeah . I searched the web ,  and  I searched  on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .  but  they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . And then  that  This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of  L_C_D_ or  speech recognition . marketing: But  this is the second  important  aspect , and I think  we must use some of the new technology , to be  innovative . And it says  fashion-watchers of   Pari  France and  Italy , yeah ,  have detected the following trends . marketing: But the  the next  aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe   is expected to be spongy . marketing: But spongy , what what does spongy says ? industrial designer: Spongy . project manager: because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . project manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ? user interface: How are you gonna make it ? project manager: R_ soft . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing:  industrial designer: I've some  material  information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation . marketing: Okay ? project manager: marketing: What do I think ?  because a fancy look is the most important thing  for remote control  control , I think about changeable fronts . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget . marketing: Intro project manager: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . user interface: So  industrial designer: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: and it's easy to implement . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so  but  marketing: user interface: if we implement  speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . So you can say , you can user interface: Since you have to  configure speech thing . project manager: But that's definitely more expensive than user interface: Yeah , that's that's something I dunno . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . user interface: Yeah , so  we gotta de project manager: So  user interface: We have to decide on that . That was this ? user interface:   industrial designer: Oh I got an email  And it says  the chip can be  simple , regular or advanced . So user interface: L_D_C_ doesn't require industrial designer: it's m the most expensive . industrial designer: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but user interface: I'll I'll give you my design . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . project manager: Yeah , maybe the teletext tel user interface: Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . user interface: but it's marketing: No , I don't  I don't like it . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . industrial designer: Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . user interface: They're on top ? project manager: Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . industrial designer: But I I think w you'll use  the switch channels buttons  more often than the normal  channel buttons , like one two three . I dunno , but yeah we'll industrial designer: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . user interface: And  if you don't light 'em up , they don't  you don't see 'em very good . industrial designer: That's that's good , but user interface: I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . It's s We have to look  what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . user interface: I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . Yeah , maybe industrial designer: But  we we can switch those two , user interface: Those two , yeah . user interface: And  , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to  Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . And  well  if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to  switch it open . project manager: We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this  fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of project manager: Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . user interface:  Yeah , it's project manager: So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . industrial designer: Yeah ,  n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . user interface: Yeah , but  I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But project manager: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but user interface: Yeah , okay . user interface:  can't we use  different  fron  fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So project manager: Yeah , it's cool . industrial designer: S user interface: You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make  different fronts on it . user interface: A more Yeah , just  marketing:   project manager: That's better prob industrial designer: With the hard hard buttons . The the the new  new modern  remote controls ,  the buttons are part of the  the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .  it's n doesn't Is  a button   How do you say it ? industrial designer: Yeah , it's it's all on one level . marketing: It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background . project manager: basic remote control from normal plastic , marketing: project manager: and industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . industrial designer: So if you put project manager: Y i if you The numbers could be can be user interface:  you can just make them around the buttons  project manager: Yeah , that's right . user interface: Or it runs the whole industrial designer: Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . user interface: Yeah , you can halfs transparent , industrial designer: Or no user interface: or just that it's comes out a bit . user interface:  depends on the colour of the project manager: Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . Is marketing: but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? user interface: Yeah , it can . project manager: industrial designer: I don't know what it is , but it should be there I think . marketing: project manager: user interface: industrial designer:  this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of  things . project manager: Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so industrial designer: W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . user interface: industrial designer:  they they basically said that that's almost the same on any  remote controls . project manager: We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? industrial designer: Yeah but project manager: Is that still the user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it ? Accu . user interface: project manager: It's just batteries , industrial designer: so marketing: project manager: that's cheaper . So we need  the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . industrial designer:  are are we using a a rubber case , or project manager: Oh just sk industrial designer: We haven't decided yet . It's user interface:  I don't think a rubber case looks industrial designer: L marketing:  but we have to do something about the trend . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? user interface:  I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . industrial designer: So we should did it here ? project manager: That's for th user interface: So we're staying here ? project manager:  that I think that's the next next meeting . user interface: Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those . You see what  ? industrial designer: What ? project manager: If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than industrial designer: Oh . industrial designer: I think  you'll get a a lot of  volume changing when it's not wanted . project manager: And industrial designer: Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . user interface: Yeah , maybe you just have to make it  That's not scrollable too easy . And  what's the channel choose ? Where do we  put that ? Still on the bottom industrial designer: I think in middle . project manager: or user interface:  wh what is the middle part ? project manager: That's the numbers . industrial designer:  I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . project manager: It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s  the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . user interface: Use the dz project manager: Because you already have the volume here , so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . project manager: So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . industrial designer: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . project manager: But that's not want to zap very quick , so user interface: Yeah , I think  zapping is the highest priority . project manager: Yeah ? Is this a opportunity , user interface: And then you use those  project manager: or you don't want a different user interface: Yeah , of course  . industrial designer:  but I think we we should bu  put 'em on top of each other , so project manager: Why ? industrial designer: Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up project manager: But still the next It's still the next one . Doesn't make industrial designer: Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is If you put them project manager: Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . industrial designer: But  but I I think  left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with  channel changing . user interface: Yeah , I think industrial designer: So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning  time . I You already have the volume on the side , user interface: No ,  I think project manager: so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . project manager: So it's  user interface: I think it's s so simple industrial designer: I dunno . user interface: you just project manager: So but that's for that's for you , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: 'cause it's user interface: Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . user interface: Think we need to work  thirty minutes again ? marketing: Yeah , we have to care that it r  looks really new . marketing: 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . user interface: No , you have  It is industrial designer: Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . marketing: Some some kind of bling bling   can we have industrial designer: user interface: Where you can put a ve  we have If we do it like that we have below have we  a lot of room to put a nice logo . marketing:  and how many  fronts  fronts do we put on the market then ?  five or something ? project manager: Yeah , five . user interface: marketing: Or more or user interface: Maybe you can buy separate ones and  marketing: And    buy the product . industrial designer: No , tha that will be project manager: So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ? user interface: Yes . marketing: Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet . industrial designer: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . user interface: I think i marketing: user interface: Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . industrial designer: Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of  As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . project manager: industrial designer: project manager: It's a bit annoying , isn't it ? marketing: Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but marketing: Yeah , it project manager: industrial designer: Like in this kind of shape or marketing:  it's very annoying . project manager: So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . project manager: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of Skip that one as well . user interface: and marketing: It's not not a lot of trends I  I found  project manager: Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just marketing:  project manager: I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . Yeah , marketing: It The th th industrial designer: I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand  stuff . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal industrial designer: Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public . marketing: There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can  make it look not like the iPod itself . But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now project manager: But i it is it is it is already fancy . user interface: And if you make it look like the iPod marketing: Yeah , they're all the same . So that's already a very big change project manager:  maybe maybe make the the  the wha what's it called  scroll wheel . Maybe we have to ask  to the the  to her if it has if it can work better than this . project manager: We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think project manager: Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a industrial designer: S user interface: Well  project manager: advanced chip . marketing:  industrial designer: And we we have to build in a microphone and user interface: Well that's very easy . We already have  the beeping of the home station , industrial designer: Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that . user interface: so industrial designer: I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , marketing: No . Becau project manager: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , marketing: Yeah . But project manager: okay ? user interface: So marketing: Ma user interface: shall we it open then ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Oh yeah , I marketing: But we don't have any f information about the cost . marketing: We started with information about the cost was now th user interface: I just I just received the industrial designer: Yeah ,  I have I have some some information about the cost . marketing: And how much is the chip ? The the the industrial designer: I don't know how much , but user interface: Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . industrial designer: Just in inexpensive or user interface: This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . user interface: Yeah  th that's just It's a marketing: Does it say does it say something back ? project manager: Okay , we have to stop it now . Yeah , it Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . project manager: Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced industrial designer: But i it's a separate chip . user interface: I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . industrial designer: Yeah , I don't know anything about this , marketing:  project manager: Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , industrial designer: but Nah . project manager: Okay , just user interface: And there's a chip in it that will project manager: We have to stop it now <doc-sep>industrial designer: user interface: project manager: Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . So just to kick off the meeting basically  so we're working now for a real reaction , this is  so it right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting .  We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another  then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard .  we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up .  I guess you know game or something  in real life  so yeah basically I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about   proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell .  so  if you say something about marketing , right , sorted ,  y is marketing: You're just gonna believe me , industrial designer: marketing: we'll go from there . project manager: obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know  you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it .  we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or  yeah it seems like marketing: Prove it project manager: yeah yeah exactly marketing: yeah , okay . project manager: so , 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well  . And that's the same for your when we do introductions   and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to   you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know industrial designer: marketing: project manager: you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ? industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's fine . So I guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling industrial designer: Right . project manager:   but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys  checked the   the corporate website .  we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So  basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly  slick sleek kind of way .  way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the   the other designer that I can't remember , marketing: project manager: the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right  the Industrial Designer industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: hey right on alright , user interface:  . project manager: to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_  at the same time . And then  we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like  I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of  , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that .  and so we'll work up from there and  then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can  hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously  the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible  to try t of sync it all up .  right so for now just for th the white board  basically  just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either  I'm just gonna start and   carry like five remotes around  and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my  desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could  . marketing: project manager: I'm Marty , industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  I went to uni at  U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology . So marketing: I'm Sarah , I went to Michigan , and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something . industrial designer: I'm Nathan , I'm from California , and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology . project manager: Where did you go to uni Nathan ? industrial designer: U_C_L_A_ . marketing: So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us ? project manager: Well I'll t i marketing: I'm waiting to know . See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are , I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent marketing:  project manager: but there's some other options , if you're a T_V_ slut marketing: Fair enough . project manager: like I am like Smallville terrible television show industrial designer: user interface: project manager: but I happen to love it , marketing: Oh , Smallville .  and  oh well I might as well throw a British person in there  you can't go wrong with Radiohead . Alright so  user interface: project manager: whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want . Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , Chris Bathgate , project manager:  . marketing: really lame user interface: marketing: and   what else did I bring with me ? Probably classical , to totally geek it out , project manager: Okay yeah yeah . Isn't h has h industrial designer: project manager: do you watch the new season ? marketing: No . Are you getting it online , project manager: I think I'm gonna start downloading it marketing: or is it on sky ? project manager: yeah . user interface: marketing: It's the five by five , I can't read that much . user interface: I just came from Glasgow project manager:  marketing: Seriously ? user interface: and I'm  happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately . project manager: I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right . And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people , project manager: Oh , have you been home yet ? user interface: project manager: They'll be like , say something British , marketing: no . project manager: Bad religion ? marketing: 'Cause industrial designer: Yeah , that's the music I grew up listening to . user interface: industrial designer: And so there marketing: Oh , now I can think of so many other ones . project manager: Where are you from in California by the way ? user interface: industrial designer: I grew up in San Diego , project manager: Did you really ? What part ? industrial designer: but yeah  La Jolla , P_B_ . industrial designer: But really  I last lived in San Francisco , I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen . project manager: Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego . 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them . project manager: Well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it marketing: Ah . project manager: like I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay , it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Close t  do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Cafe Forte project manager: Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . project manager: a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s industrial designer: Wow . user interface: project manager: and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll user interface: project manager:  right so marketing: project manager: moving on to not fun stuff  project finance . user interface: project manager:  basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I don't know , I'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear ,  twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . project manager: what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . So  one of the things I I was gonna mention to you  you guys the designers is that  it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . project manager: something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s marketing: Makes sense . project manager: I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing .  s right so  just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used  next time right Project Manager , sorted . Is  we'll meet in another half an hour or so  and I'd like the  Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .  U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . project manager: So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , you know like  so marketing: And negotiate that . project manager: yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between  so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now  and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth .  any questions , before we get started ? user interface: I assume that we're building a stand alone  remote control , we can't kind of build it into other  products . project manager: You mean to like user interface: For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . user interface: Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? project manager: Well , have a think about it . project manager: I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able marketing: W yeah .   or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . We'll see what see what industrial designer: Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to  I don't really have any . user interface: Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? project manager: Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do . user interface: S does anybody have any initial ideas ? project manager: I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause marketing: Good idea . marketing: right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: or like to have everything on one thing , project manager: marketing: but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , project manager: user interface: But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_  design marketing: Yeah . We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: of  so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote ? user interface:  I don't know if there's such a thing out there , I guess we could do some  do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are  multi-format like  you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one marketing: Right . user interface:  I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ project manager: Okay . user interface: that he just points at his telev any television he wants marketing: That user interface: and it'll figure out the the specifications of it marketing: Yeah . I li I'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . industrial designer: I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . And I don't know , like , there's such a problem with losing them , project manager: marketing: that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , industrial designer:  . marketing: Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool . industrial designer: user interface: In in marketing: Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ? project manager: Think they're just called face plates ? marketing: Isn't there a name for them ? project manager: I don't know . industrial designer: I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . user interface: If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either marketing: True . project manager: Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of   cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes , user interface: Th marketing: Right . project manager:  yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of   you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of marketing:  . marketing: And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so . project manager: We do have the minimum am amount  we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive marketing: Right . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote marketing: Right . project manager: But  have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it marketing: Yeah . project manager: and  marketing: Or if you our users in mind , like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But user interface: We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ? project manager: Twenty five Euros . project manager: They serve  right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America marketing:  . Right so  let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the  project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about  the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . Let's just  head back to work on what we were talking about bef  goi h h getting into <doc-sep>So basically we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to  for this meeting to  to discuss the various options . industrial designer: We have a I guess we have a presentation each , 'cause I've got one .  so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to  W I I got  or or three things basically ,  relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . project manager: So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense . user interface: What is it ? industrial designer: I'm not quite sure how it user interface: I think you've got to do  control F_ eight . user interface: Ah there , marketing: Oh hang on , user interface: it's doing something .  I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself  . And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . industrial designer: We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . And then the sender , which  is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television .  and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's obviously found in the television .  I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because  it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , so . S   do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? Oh I'll j project manager:  there's the rubber on the right , I think . Okay , so we start off with a  battery suppl  no , a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery .  we then have a particular button , which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons .  that sends after you press that that sends the message to the chip , which  then sends It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . That's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together .  this is the chip itself , which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote .  and then the sender , marketing: industrial designer: and infra-red  has been used quite successfully .  so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed .  an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down ,  so obviously you need two different buttons for that .  by the look of it they both have  kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . So , it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons .  I like the use of the kind of  symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the  kind of play functions and all that . user interface: Will you be presenting that in a bit ? project manager: But  I got  I got an email that basically said to  make sure that  whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate  the corporate colour and slogan . So  I'm guessing that   I notice on the bottom there it's got  what's that ? A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red . industrial designer: Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . Possibly ? user interface: What do you mean by the circular section ? industrial designer: J yeah yeah yeah j yeah user interface: Like all of that bottom bit ? project manager: industrial designer: just this little bit is that I think that's still  a video remote part , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Well b  w user interface:  how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . project manager: Well th the on the user interface: Like how often do you hit nine ? project manager: Well  for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , marketing: But but industrial designer: It's just people are used to seeing that , so if we didn't have them then they might think it's project manager: But , well possibly but the the other thing is that with  the current expansion of  channels  in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but   how many channels do we have to  actual television channels do we have to  prepare for ? I would have thought that  it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six industrial designer: project manager: and  there's  I don't know exactly how many channels there are on  when you take into account  Sky and various other  various others . project manager: So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather user interface:  . project manager: Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take a second user interface: project manager: 'cause you have to be able to stop it . Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . industrial designer: user interface:  some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six ,  if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have  if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty industrial designer: user interface:  . project manager: and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want marketing: user interface: But I think a lot of  like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . industrial designer: I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you  it's like  multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . industrial designer: So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with project manager: Yeah Well that's true , yeah , industrial designer: Yeah .  I think that's just for a video , so we wouldn't need any of that at all . industrial designer: So we could get it down to what ? project manager: If it's just for T_V_ , which is what it is at the moment . industrial designer: So we get to How many buttons have we got ? We've just got ten , eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need . Well we've we've got  that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with  which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . project manager: I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing , marketing: project manager: or was I meant to give you that information ? marketing:  I'm not sure . project manager: Right , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: user interface: Okay , so is everyone happy with that ? industrial designer: Ah yes yes , that seems good . industrial designer: marketing: Right , we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and  how do people use it ? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them .  how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s  a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings ,  they weren't used very often at all . And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well .  we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn  all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . Okay , so My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech A design which looks high-tech , basically .  and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said .  we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control .  and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because  sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of  having it to speech recognition to change the channels . 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . project manager: What was that last wee bit there ? user interface: Do a lot of  marketing:  about speech recognition ? project manager: Speech recognition , user interface: marketing: Yeah . marketing: Youn young people pref Yeah , they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so . industrial designer: No what I maybe think is  it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . industrial designer: And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , industrial designer: That is true , yes . user interface: There's key rings  that you kind of whistle at or clap at , I can't remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that . So industrial designer: So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . project manager: Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition .  I dunno  talking about vo  obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be . project manager: But you've then got the point if if you're not going with  voice recognition then industrial designer: you could have an option to turn it off . industrial designer: So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . marketing: project manager: So  Any sugges Well , any conclusions ? marketing:  would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? user interface: project manager: Well if it does then we can't . project manager: because we've got  th th three  primary   requisites from  from and email  that was sent to me whereby we had The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . We've got  the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly . project manager: And the  third thing was that  teletext  as far as  the management is concerned ,  is becoming dated  due to the popularity of the internet . project manager: So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is  wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . project manager: So anything that  is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick industrial designer: Has to be simple enough to project manager: because time to market is is critical . S industrial designer: I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . project manager: Added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within  this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours .  d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with  added extras if possible . project manager: and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next  meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . project manager: So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that  only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making  process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . project manager: so that rather than coming you know If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate . project manager: But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their  on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . project manager: Right , is there marketing: So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S project manager: I would guess so . user interface: Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of  kind of whistle back kind of function . marketing: Yeah and Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so . user interface: marketing: I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so . project manager: I w well  i industrial designer: Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , project manager: Something simple .  if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , industrial designer: and if something comes back project manager: you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , user interface: user interface: And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . project manager: On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , industrial designer: project manager: now something that doesn't like whis  marketing: No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? project manager: Well I I I don't know . Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , user interface: project manager: but if I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , marketing: No , industrial designer: I'd go more marketing: clapping , I think clapping , industrial designer: Yeah , f more for clap . user interface: 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ? project manager:  . Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying , user interface: Is that one of the project manager: that  if  if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext , user interface:  . industrial designer: and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , ten numbers user interface: industrial designer: and then some kind of device to allow  marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Did we decide anything about  the other functions ? As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? You had an had an idea about the menu ? marketing:  we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that industrial designer: But just thinking  people probably  you don't have you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once . industrial designer: So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . project manager: But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic industrial designer: So that'll be in marketing: Yeah . But at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it  your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: And it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we're not really going for something that's  terribly high-tech . I s I suppose  if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote project manager: Possibly . marketing:  we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . industrial designer: Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . user interface: and it was too dark , so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up . industrial designer: and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced  instruction booklet to come with it , to guide Presu  I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp  just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . marketing:  I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . marketing: So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , so you're basically pressing industrial designer: that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so . user interface: Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of  the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of  everything else revealed ? marketing: Okay . user interface: So you don't use it that much , you don't have to see it all the time . project manager: Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told . And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , project manager: Ah . industrial designer: So  we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . marketing:  sorta project manager: That's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back . industrial designer: So sh Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then marketing: user interface: I know it's probably like  not an issue to raise here , but  the whole thing about not using your standby  because of the like waste of electricity . Have you seen the adverts ? Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste . user interface: If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time . project manager: So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . industrial designer:  are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? marketing:  'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . industrial designer: So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? project manager: Channel up and down . project manager: What else have we got ? What was that , sixteen ? marketing: Numbers is ten , volume is twelve , project manager: Volume button . industrial designer: Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . project manager: anything else ? You're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were . marketing: And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . We don't really need any other audio funct  functions because it's just volume up , volume down . user interface: So I think  there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . industrial designer: Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: or do you have to do it via the remote ? user interface:  I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . industrial designer: Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . user interface: Oh no ,   like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the T_V_ remote . industrial designer: Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think project manager: Well you might get some research "

        "Query": "What were the reasons for Marketing's disagreement with the Project Manager and Industrial Design regarding the technical functions, advanced techniques, and touch screen of the new remote control, considering the budget limitations?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager recognized the importance of targeting customers below the age of forty, as they have specific needs that should be addressed. However, Marketing disagreed and suggested that the project should cater to a larger group of people, rather than just those under forty. The Industrial Design team proposed incorporating advanced techniques, such as a touchscreen, to make the remote control more unique. Despite the advantages of a touchscreen, such as making the remote control smaller and easier to use, Marketing rejected the idea due to budget constraints. In order to balance cost and functionality, the Project Manager suggested giving up voice recognition and keeping the touchscreen. However, Marketing's research showed that interviewees had a strong preference for voice recognition, even when they were not informed about the touchscreen. Therefore, Marketing insisted on keeping voice recognition to cater to popular demand. The Industrial Designer believed that it was impossible to create a universal remote control that could accommodate different TV brands, as each brand has its own remote control. However, Marketing believed that this issue could be solved by developing a universal remote control with a code.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: Okay , project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: how can I get this on the whiteboard ? project manager: Well it's you dumped the file in the  in the sh in the project document folder .  , diodes ,  bat batteries and   LED lights , they're needed and they're  everywhere available . It's a common  technology  , like I told   , the circuit board , it's the most  important   part of the remote control .  , we can use for that  fibreglass with copper wires , it's it is  can be made as fast as printing paper . project manager: But you don't think it's a problem  to design  the technical part of the remote control ? It's gonna be easy ? industrial designer: No . M user interface: With technical industrial designer: no , it's  it's just a part of  a known technology , yeah . industrial designer:  user interface: But I kind of  industrial designer: I don't think so , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: because of the all the televisions  there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , user interface: Yes . industrial designer: but is it useful to put them on a on a standard  remote ? project manager: Well , we'll see .  , well I don't know if you got the same  pictures as I got , project manager: No . user interface: and I think they're we have to focus  on  the  one hand the expert view or the novice user . th I think it's it's very much  depending on the user requirements , I don't s  know who's doing t project manager: Well ,  will there be some  user requirements later on ? The ones I I've  received from the account manager . user interface: Yeah , but it I think that's very important to watch  what kind of functions there we want to  put in a remote control . user interface: Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when  yeah , when we  get the user requirements  and we can update it . we should we should choose one  we should not compromise but  really choose for  expert viewer or novice v marketing: Yes , I agree . user interface: Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market ,  like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . It's it's really  depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n  in use . Well , some of that will Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the  u  some of the new requirements . project manager: So user interface:  well , there are l at least  basic functions ,  like just th the channels  one till nine ,  on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that .  , most standard  have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel .  Yeah , I just   I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there  are any   if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . user interface: M you can just you can k marketing: I haven't really found a conclusion like that .  , I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier  marketing: Design . project manager: user interface: Yeah ? marketing: user interface: well , that's all I have to say , I think . The working method  there were hundred   w h one hundred people ,  how do you say  , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also  filled out a questionnaire  with a few questions .  , ask whether  common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and  and stuff like that . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .  , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more  , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and  very much used . And  an important thing here , the most important customers  , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And  elderly people , our market , are less interested in  nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . We shouldn't implement too much features on  on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost .  , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them  on one button and make them accessible  in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it  there are a lot of options there , so we can really make  yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . marketing: And  , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too  Yeah . Small buttons , so they won't be very  , how do you say project manager: Visually presents . And a trendy look , well  , although seventy percent of the market is  consists of elderly people  who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . project manager: Well , then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on  what features we find important . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . project manager: So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or marketing: Not too much , no . project manager: You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma  the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely . So you  talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . project manager: But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger marketing: I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we  want to reach customers younger than forty . project manager: Yeah , but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . marketing: Mayb yeah ? project manager: Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . project manager: no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . user interface: But what's our slogan ? project manager: Sorry ? Yeah , you will have to look that up . I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but user interface: Sense simplicity . Well , if I can  make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some marketing: project manager: Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . marketing: Well , to be honest , if  our  aim group is  till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very  yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control . marketing: I think we can implement more functions then , because  basically  the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology user interface: Yeah , but wha project manager: Yeah , yeah . marketing: and therefore will be a more project manager: M yeah , that's why  well a lot of  the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , user interface: But project manager: because they want a simpler design , and no  other  s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger marketing: Yes . project manager: Well , ma user interface: Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . user interface: So why should j we put this function in ? marketing: Well , I think user interface: I think more I think  people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than  more functions . industrial designer: project manager: But I think  you we can make some discuss  distinctions in  what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have Y Well you have different kind of  equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . project manager: You can  , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control  with the with  the , you know , audio settings and  v  screen settings . But w maybe we should put some func  , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , you know , they want to  marketing: Yeah , control . user interface: Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making . marketing: project manager: No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to user interface: It's n Yeah . Maybe like rewind and wind , marketing: project manager: or n what d what do you guys think ? industrial designer: But you can put them under the same button . project manager: But what do you think ? marketing: So t project manager: Do th should we implement features that   or functions that to control other devices ? user interface: No . project manager: No , you don't think so ? marketing: user interface: No , new requirements say no . project manager: maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . user interface: Yeah , but project manager: You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with industrial designer: Yes , but we user interface: I i if it's too simple  th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions . That's that's wha marketing: But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme  the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , project manager: No no , you don't No no , you don't need it . project manager: Okay , but we have to think  w we have to think D_V_D_ I th  , I guess , marketing: Yeah , I know , but  project manager: so  but  from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . project manager: Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m  Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then . user interface: Yeah , but just keep it simple and look more at th project manager: And  and it's just an  a complimentary remote and not a universal one . It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , industrial designer: Yes , but there are there are project manager: and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more . project manager: but what televis industrial designer: But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are  a dozen of  dozens of of remote controls that have project manager: Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . project manager: Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . If you have a  a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , project manager: Oh , okay . marketing: then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but project manager: Yeah , but  I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . project manager: Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And user interface: Will you look marketing: industrial designer: project manager: we have to well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . user interface: Yeah , I  , it's Sunday I always use it for the  yeah , for the soccer  project manager: Yeah , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ? Or do you think it  I think it's a kind of   very rare and special function . user interface: Well ,  when you   when you look  for example  , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th project manager: Yeah . Okay , it goes Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . industrial designer: Yes , but you could put user interface: Yeah , but industrial designer: on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to  to  access all the same pages . project manager: Well yeah  , industrial designer: If you have seven pages , you can go up and down . project manager: lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using industrial designer: Yes . we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess .  , well , what functions do we have to decide on ? Or do we  I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . marketing: I think the plus and the minus button should be  quite present , project manager: Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also . project manager: Or maybe you should place them on a  , in a special way ? user interface: I don't know . project manager: Yeah , something or  somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah , and quick . project manager: Yeah , and it the buttons should make it  possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace . project manager: Oh , what should we decide on then ? I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which  weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then . user interface: Maybe  project manager: No , okay , but we don't have to  , when we don't want to  control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple . project manager: I think that we should use  d user interface: Yeah ? marketing: I think double A_ . project manager: th the most  Well , it has to be simple , and I wi user interface: Yeah . How much time do we ha we have left  ? M m m more than thirty minutes ? marketing: I think about twenty minutes . But that's that's Do you  have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can what the extra touch can be . Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or industrial designer: Maybe th m project manager: Well , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . marketing: I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or  ten to twelve or whatever . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Nah ,  a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i has something nice . project manager: Or maybe it w should have a big  light that can flash or something on it , user interface: Yeah . I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . marketing: Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . But and I think it's gonna be  very  it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . project manager: you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . project manager: So maybe  that's i I think that's when  when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions ,  it's very important to find something like this . project manager: also for you maybe , when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and  and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . project manager: So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . project manager: Yeah , or just different colours would be  I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their  remote control . project manager: It could be be Yeah , you never know , but user interface: Why not ? marketing: Yeah . If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions marketing: project manager: want to be you don't want to get it l make it marketing: Yes , it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . Yeah , you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or  something you put on a table . project manager: Yeah yeah , but yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in marketing: If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . user interface: project manager: I I don't marketing: I in in the base we could like make  a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . marketing: That's probably stupid , but  as I found here  , fifty percent , was it fifty ? industrial designer: But that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second marketing:  fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control . project manager: Yeah , but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it marketing: No  , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . marketing: If an a button in in that  user interface: project manager: And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it  chargeable . project manager: Yeah , that w yeah , but yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't Yeah . project manager: Maybe you , but we don't know much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units . Aye ? project manager: Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So , it's not gonna be that expen user interface: Production . project manager: S some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it   be  , you see it with  the mo the mouses nowadays . industrial designer: Yes , but is that handy ? project manager: Well , I well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . user interface: It's it's it's it's project manager: And  you can always find your remote control up user interface: it's not the purpose to be handy , it's industrial designer: But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last  two years , three years , with with t two batteries . Well , maybe yeah , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , industrial designer: And then you project manager: but you will you do need  also an  , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . Or marketing: Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . project manager: Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . marketing: On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay .  , it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it , project manager: Yeah . marketing: but  I think the bay is definitely  project manager: I think it's a good idea . And make it , you know , we we  Well , we  it's it isn't a t a most  costly  remote control . We just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it  that it lights up , marketing: Sure , why not . And if you put it away , I think it's  w we have to we  that's  marketing: Yeah . And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , marketing: Yeah . project manager: and we can't deliver that in r with  regards to the functions , user interface: Yeah . project manager: because we aren't gonna put marketing: With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . And then  when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing . project manager: Oh , if it let's well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . project manager: And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo I've experienced that that marketing: Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes . Well , we will we will I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi user interface: Or just give a beep when the battery's out or  down . user interface: project manager: 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . project manager: You don't want to have ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable . And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . project manager: Yeah , but it w  , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . Then when they look get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and  just push the button and th  , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , I've never it's so simple , but I've never seen it . project manager: Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? These clocks aren't  synched . marketing: project manager: Oh , now I've put  well , it is twenty p user interface: Yeah , I'll project manager: Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ? marketing: Something like that , yeah . project manager: Oh okay , I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with  the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . user interface: Can you make an   a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? project manager: . Yeah , because  I I d I did  the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could  , know , use for the other ones well , but  I d think  I forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second  it's get it's not working when you try to write second  paper or something . project manager: And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . Has anyone got  a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? user interface: Do you get an idea of the shape ? marketing: I don't , for one . user interface: A little bit bigger , yeah but marketing: The shape is nice , it's  something different , and we want we want that . project manager: Well , I I I have to say , I have this  can opening remote control in my head most of all , marketing: Yeah . user interface: project manager: or I think some maybe we should no , that will be too costly . project manager: We shou we could also , that was a would also be an idea , but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it . But that's gonna then you c then you don't marketing: Yeah , but twelve and a half Euros ?  project manager: Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time , you know s was it's a single cost . project manager: Yeah , m but but then you can nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive . marketing: Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi  y your hands will be in the smaller part . project manager: And and lights ? How we're g well , maybe  s a ring of no , no , you have to Maybe on the side of it . project manager: Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to   locate your remote . And then you have a strip of  lights or something user interface: Yeah , exactly , and then there is yeah . industrial designer: marketing: Half and hour ? user interface: Okay , five  marketing: I thought our next  next individual round was half an hour <doc-sep>Right so  this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Right so  , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , and gonna go through you ,  whoever wants to go first is f fine by me  and we'll collate what we know about  what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . And then we'll make some more decisions on  basic  firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? industrial designer: No Nathan's fine . industrial designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is  component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , project manager:  . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Basically , it's like a  the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .  and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . project manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? industrial designer: I imagine that we could specify . industrial designer: the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips ,  and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case  we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . industrial designer: one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light .  one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . industrial designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . project manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like industrial designer: Yeah .  , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip .  , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . project manager: user interface: industrial designer:  findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer ,  and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? user interface: Interesting question . marketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? project manager:  .  , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table ,  I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on .  , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and  I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know , say our the one marketing: Right . industrial designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation . project manager: Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ? marketing:  It's an option ,  but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now project manager: Okay . project manager: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Did you ? marketing: You waiting for me ? project manager: Fascinating , compelling even .  , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening .  , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional ,  that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface .  the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . user interface: project manager: user interface: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use  natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , industrial designer:  . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface  , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be project manager: Tomatoes . marketing: a different shape industrial designer: user interface: marketing: or okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what  to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing:  not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like  not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like  , leather options or wood options or something industrial designer:  . As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , marketing: So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . industrial designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . project manager: Yeah , it's like , yep industrial designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you , marketing: Very much so . project manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it ? user interface: We can have a duck tape casing . user interface: marketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , project manager: user interface: It could go with the granola crowd . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: Ah , it could be , it could be , project manager: Great , marketing:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise  perceive . Here's a d series of different remote controls industrial designer: user interface: that are out on the market today .  voice recognition , we we  actually have some new  information from our research design team but  I'll get to that in a moment .  , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples ,  and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to  set up a system in which  you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to  with standard responses . Like you could say good morning  remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . project manager: marketing: project manager: industrial designer: user interface: In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line marketing:  . project manager: Lot of single people on the  on the re on the remote control research team user interface: On the remote control industrial designer: project manager: at the user interface: right . user interface: another concept is what  Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with  L_C_ display like on the  iPod project manager:  . user interface:  and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , project manager:  . user interface: And  some special components ,  ideas like  blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children  and  dedicated buttons for for commonly used  channels and even  ideas like secured or hidden programming but  I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . user interface: again probably not what we're going for marketing: user interface: so I  my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod  with a hard cla c  plastic casing marketing: Okay . user interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely  very good ideas .  changeable casings  our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it marketing: right . user interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our  bottom line .  touch screen interface ,  possibly having go-to buttons being  stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels .  , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already project manager:  . user interface: and  the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features  that are around so red for power ,  arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . user interface: And  perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh  for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank marketing: user interface: has jokes when it's ready . project manager: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the  various costs and benefits  I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? marketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places . marketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then project manager: marketing: right ? industrial designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , project manager: To produce each one . marketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? project manager: Well . project manager: There is , it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . marketing: Can we justify it ? project manager: from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift  hundred per cent profit margin  that would mean selling it from twenty five . project manager: So user interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? industrial designer: That's just off the top of my head , project manager: From the board , industrial designer: it is pending further emails . project manager: well marketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for , user interface: marketing:  if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something project manager: That's true ,  industrial designer: It is the new it would be in a class of its own . project manager: And that's to be fair the  the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make  we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros , marketing: Right . project manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . project manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? user interface: I'm thinking that's  definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper  means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the  on the third floor suggested that  marketing: See if we can cut some corners . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . industrial designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on marketing: Right . project manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our  our main selling point here . project manager: So user interface:  I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition marketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition  really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . project manager: if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , user interface: project manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec . user interface: To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , marketing: Price-wise . user interface:  we've we've come up with this , with this new voice marketing: True . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? industrial designer: I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up  but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . marketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . user interface: Does having both really up our costs ? project manager: I can't see how it wouldn't , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . project manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . What which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? marketing: Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But  I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . industrial designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's project manager: What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the  touch screen ? user interface: Well my p is project manager: Nathan ? marketing:  . industrial designer: this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would they're both  they're both gonna push the costs up , but  , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition project manager:  . marketing: And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , project manager:  . So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . marketing: which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option . industrial designer: marketing: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right ? project manager: Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype . industrial designer: Are we going to talk now about  the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? project manager: Yes . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? industrial designer: the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . industrial designer: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to marketing: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement , project manager:  . marketing: like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably industrial designer: It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , marketing: industrial designer: and you know how those those don't really require that much light , user interface: Calculator . industrial designer: but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . project manager: What do you think Ron ? user interface: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . If we're really not  handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little  neat thing that sits on your table or something . industrial designer: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? user interface: Just a thought . industrial designer: What's the  idea ? user interface: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . marketing: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . marketing: True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , project manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . project manager: But that's done , that's no bother  if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like  who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know marketing: project manager: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know  use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know  we can sort that out . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time . user interface: I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things . project manager: Yeah ,  a nice although we do  wh  is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing marketing: Right . project manager: but you could have a very tasteful  wood coloured or earth tone kind of  marketing: That would be kinda neat . And the  the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being  using like a rubber kind of softer feel , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . project manager: something where it's  a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . marketing: Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . user interface: project manager: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . industrial designer: project manager: But to be fair , yeah , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . I guess we'll a that's gonna be  a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay ,  . industrial designer: Sorry about the  lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers marketing: Okay . project manager: We'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a industrial designer: and I'm just having to guess .  , so user interface: project manager: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a  a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be industrial designer: Right . marketing: Take precedence , industrial designer: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can  just incorporate maybe something that folds out marketing: yeah . industrial designer: like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here project manager:  . marketing: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p user interface: Think then we're hitting our cost issue again . project manager: Yeah marketing: True , project manager: we've also got the the me the thing of , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we yeah . project manager: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . project manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on  like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have  a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them marketing: industrial designer: So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ?  project manager: Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the  stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of  rubber for the outside case marketing: Yeah . user interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with  kind of  a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for . That seems to be selling  and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market ,  . project manager: Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . project manager: The  , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth user interface: Sure . industrial designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? project manager:  . industrial designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well  . industrial designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so project manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have  a , you know , a   kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and  , I don't know , olive green or something . project manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . user interface: And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's  colour scheme . project manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on  multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . I want the  I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of  non-remote remote . project manager: And  Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: And also  specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . project manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ? marketing: Cool <doc-sep> I'm the Project Manager of this project , and  , well I will tell you on what actually is the project .  there are cameras industrial designer: project manager: everywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course , and this isn't a pie , it's a a set of microphones industrial designer: project manager: and there are microphones here also .  well  user interface: Well industrial designer: project manager: I said I'm the Project Manager and  I'm hoping  for a good project and  I'd like to hear  who you are and what your functions are  on this project . industrial designer: Okay ,  I'm  I'm the Industrial Designer and I  hope to  look forward to  a very  pleasing  end of this  project .  well I said  we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which  has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly . As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss  our work so far .  as you also noticed  this presentation document is in our  project folder and every document you put in this folder  is  it is possible to show that here in our meeting room .  and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will  mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder .  the most functions  we will use will be to to add a new page ,   to go back and forward between pages , and of course  to save it every now and then .  and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance like this if everything's okay , user interface: project manager: but I first have to put it on the pen , you see I'm new to it too . project manager: As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board . industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here ,  erase things , so we have  est left . project manager: Well you can erase it with the eraser , but  you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one . marketing: S project manager: I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet . project manager: But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't  delete entire pages . And you can also  let's see I think it's here  change the  colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and  change the line width like to five .  that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm  going to ask you to draw your favourite animal . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: It's also to gets to know each other because  I'm asking three things ,  for that  drawing , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . Well I'm not very good at drawing , but I will  go first and  try to draw user interface: project manager: Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh . And I hope our project group will not be slow , industrial designer: project manager: but we will  work to a good result industrial designer: project manager: and do it  as fast as we can . user interface: marketing: I think it's easy to r  to recognise as a giraffe . marketing: Anything else you need to know ? project manager: Could you write the words ,  underneath it ? Or more words . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Well  industrial designer: user interface: you can guess what it is , I hope . project manager: industrial designer: I've I've  user interface: industrial designer: Eraser . I can see we have some  drawing talent  in this group , industrial designer: user interface: Not really . And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and  we are hoping to achieve that  by aiming for an international market .  what's your experience with remote controls ,  what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . marketing: Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons , user interface: Yeah , that's right . industrial designer: Yeah marketing: so industrial designer: but you could  I thin  there's a possibility to g  to  to put those buttons  behind some  kind of  protection marketing: Flap user interface: Right . Yeah , okay , that's possible , industrial designer: That's possible , so that you only get the marketing: but it'll get very big the the remote control . industrial designer: No n n no , just  for example you got th  the same size  remote control you use everyday , but  the usual buttons such as   zapping  as you call it in Dutch . Because  things for  teletext , I dunno  , w industrial designer: marketing: - , of course . project manager: So you don't want to bother people with  loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons marketing: No . user interface: But if if it's if it's international you should  look in think in Britain they have  different things they can do with the T_V_ , or so  that you can choose what you want to see . I dunno if you should  take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s industrial designer:  . marketing: Yeah I think that's the better one , user interface: And the B_B_C_ . marketing: because I think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will  rise higher than the twelve fifty , I think . So  I think  when p  when  the customers will buy this remote control , they already have  the remote control which  companies   with  the the standards  remote control with which comes  with the television . user interface: Well industrial designer: In those in that user interface: but marketing: No but user interface: but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search . Yeah , th it it's I think that's not user interface: That's not industrial designer: Yeah but I but it is impossible to  to accommodate  accommodate  all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control . industrial designer: Because  for example Sony television  has the opportunity to s to make   to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen  teletext , and on the other side  just n  regular television . industrial designer: Because you can't use a Panasonic  remote control on a on a Philips television . marketing: Yeah , but then you have to choose the always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . But I think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's that's nowadays standard , I think . industrial designer: but  I think that most people  th  will buy the remote control because because  the first they lost the one they lost first one marketing: Simplicity . user interface: and c if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke .  our next meeting  will start well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: In the meantime  there's time for some  individual actions . project manager: that's good , five minutes and  the meeting's over ,  right on schedule . industrial designer: No , user interface: No industrial designer: the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , user interface: the Yeah . industrial designer: and the in  usability interaction user interface: project manager: Industrial Designer , okay , industrial designer: Yeah , okay . user interface: So So I should look at  what you should be able to do with the remote , or  , or how I don't really project manager:  well those instructions will be  in the email you will receive  shortly , I hope . project manager: No ? Okay well I think then we have to head  back to our offices and  start working . marketing: Where does it says we have to make a remote , because I presumed She didn't know who . project manager: Okay , well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive  shortly <doc-sep>industrial designer: Should I bring my  pen too ? project manager: Yeah just yeah , no , industrial designer: Or project manager: that's for me , I just have to make some notes . marketing: Can you hear me ? Hello ? project manager:  actually my laptop doesn't work , marketing: Test . So  the thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things or , not yet , user interface: Yes . So  , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that's what we're going to design . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the  the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's  the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what  the market is doing for what kind of  remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is  the detailed design  and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . Okay so  no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the  f  s an introduction of that one . And you already saw you know all that that you here can put  things in the the red project  map . You have to  draw  a favourite animal on the whiteboard marketing: project manager: and  and say why it's your favourite animal . So and you have this is just to try it out and we have to  use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . project manager: I just h industrial designer: project manager: Something like this ? Oh no marketing: It look like a dinosaurs . project manager: Okay , so just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . Okay and then  what's the colour ? How do I do project manager: It's in format .  there has to be water , project manager: Just marketing: but project manager: No it has to be an animal , so if that's it's it should be a shna snake or something . marketing: Yeah yeah , but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . marketing: Okay , who next ?  project manager:  do you have to write down why  that doesn't matter , just it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay . project manager: Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that no , to the yeah . industrial designer: user interface:  industrial designer: marketing: A sheep ? project manager:  we d only have twenty five minutes , so . project manager: Just hold it more more to the back then you don't have user interface: No project manager: okay . project manager: I thought these pens would be just   you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? No , not yet , okay . user interface: Yeah , that's right , project manager: But it's just user interface: it but you actually got to write on the paper . project manager: Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in  typed words in Word , marketing: Yeah yeah , it's a real pen . project manager: so that's not user interface: Yeah , but it's just a picture . user interface: You really marketing: Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: I don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure . marketing: project manager: Oh industrial designer: marketing: project manager: this is definitely the best one . project manager: Okay , so  what we know is that we have to sell this  remote control for about twenty five Euros . And  we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to  use a big market in Europe . project manager: So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno .  so we're gonna have a little discussion about  what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls . marketing: Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ? project manager: Oh yeah , that's a good question . marketing: Because we sell it    lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it  apart . project manager: I think it's I'm not I'm not sure , marketing: So I project manager: it's not  I think industrial designer: Yeah , it probably would be universal . marketing: Because user interface: And only television ? Or more devices ? project manager: I don't think you can buy a a a universal  remote control for twenty five Euros , so not sure , but industrial designer: maybe , I don't know . marketing: Yeah , I know  you can buy a re a universal  control for  only twenty  Euros project manager: Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . industrial designer: And  also for the V_C_R_ and  D_V_D_ player project manager: Yeah , everything industrial designer: and project manager: just so a lot of buttons on the remote control . project manager: what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not nothing very special , but  user interface: Well we can try to make it special . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user user interface: Well marketing: Well I th I thought about  making it the same  style as the television , we don't have  the same television  all the time , so  that's no matter .  if we  control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it  it has to be clear , because  kids and  elderly are gonna use it , so  it's not only for the  technical persons .  I think it must be a very good control , so you can    act  use it from  everywhere in your room , the the infrared  thing must be from very good quality . user interface: It shouldn't be too big , marketing: I dunno  user interface: but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so . user interface: Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , marketing: Yes user interface: maybe more trendy . user interface: Fold open , project manager: Okay , user interface: where you can see  more options . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , industrial designer: Yeah marketing: Ah industrial designer: n marketing: that's that's project manager: if you just user interface: Yeah , something  on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . project manager: Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? industrial designer:  maybe be  it's it's project manager: There are buttons on it . user interface: But that's industrial designer:  like a a to have marketing: Yeah , but user interface: Yeah , I think it's much  too expensive . project manager: marketing: And we have to care for  the strength of the remote control , project manager: Yeah . marketing: because   remote controls are most  things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often  broken . marketing: Yeah and a lots   lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not  kids  project manager: No . industrial designer: And  how about the batteries ? marketing:  industrial designer:  should you put it in a recharger or a just project manager: Oh maybe that's a good idea , marketing: Ma maybe a home station . project manager: just to put it on your television and just s recharge , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think . project manager: Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive  is a normal recharger ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: Well  how much is your  standards  mobile phone recharger ? project manager: I dunno . industrial designer: Yeah , if you buy it  separately from your phone it's probably expensive , project manager: marketing: Ah yeah . marketing: user interface: Maybe have  marketing: project manager:  if you th look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive . marketing: Yeah , but a home station is  a really good idea , because  lots of people are  lose their remote control and don't know where it is , project manager: Yeah , that's right , yeah . marketing: Maybe it's Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive . industrial designer: Yeah , but I have a mouse that's   also  user interface: Rechargeable . industrial designer: Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , user interface: Yeah . marketing:  I I set something on paper already , size , looks ,  usable ,  the buttons on usable places ,  the the on off button must be on top , project manager: Yeah . marketing: you you have to  project manager: Has it be has does it has to b have to be   like a different form than a normal remote control marketing: Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know project manager: or user interface: Well I think we have to look at that , marketing: if we user interface: 'cause well you can do the standard way , but then you won't marketing: You can make it very special , to create our own  looks , project manager: Yeah marketing: but it's very hard to industrial designer: N  if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . user interface: Well you can  have  the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume  obviously on t on top , so you can see . user interface: But the rest is  you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . user interface: So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: And what we have to think about too is   buttons that you use often are  maybe  like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you can still  do the th the functions . project manager: Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine . marketing:  on on top are the the basic options on top , industrial designer: But n user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: yeah , but  i basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , marketing: and if you fold it open project manager: But maybe it's user interface: Yeah . project manager: maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very   what's it's called ? marketing:  . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an  the strength  is not s as good as a normal  remote control . project manager: Maybe it's hard t user interface:  project manager: No , that's right . marketing:  for m for me  the Marketing Expert , the user requirements  specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the user interface: No , what you want to do with it . project manager: Yeah , I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . user interface: Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff project manager: Yeah , user interface: that you want on a project manager: no maybe not not  , that's not a f that's something for for for yeah . project manager: what's in the market , what's normal ,  what kind of  buttons do you have . user interface: What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . project manager: For the next time you have to  put it exactly on the square , so your laptop "

        "Query": "What was the final decision regarding the chip, feasibility of letting the user program the keys, and fulfilling user requirements?",
        "Summary": "The group made a decision to use a regular-style chip without an LCD display for the controller, opting for simple push buttons with the exception of a more advanced button for the interior lighting system. Concerns were raised by the industrial designer regarding the usability of the function, as it went against the product requirements. The user interface designer suggested that the usability would depend on the user's effort, leading to the decision to produce two versions of the controller - one with full user freedom and the other with some constraints. In order to meet the requirements of being fashionable and spongy, the group agreed to use wood and rubber for the controller. The buttons, which would be the part touched by users, would be made of rubber, while the rest of the controller would be made of wood to provide a natural feel.",
        "Article": " , on the agenda for this , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with  some general ideas of our design . And , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what  materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use ,  what's available to us f to actually make the remote control .  , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field .  , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .  , there are several components of , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of .  , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . project manager:  Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ? industrial designer: these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced .  , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective  circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . project manager:  What is a hand-powered dynamo ? industrial designer: where you manually charge up the power . project manager: Just every , every once in a while ? industrial designer: Like you wind up something . marketing: industrial designer: Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power .  , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful .  , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , user interface: industrial designer: 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . industrial designer: we also can choose what materials  , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more  ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . user interface: industrial designer: I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some  new multiple  option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . It , it industrial designer: project manager: we would have to have an L_C_D_  industrial designer: Yeah . We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . industrial designer: also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . industrial designer: Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with  aesthetics . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , marketing: industrial designer: then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one .  , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as industrial designer: Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . project manager: I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . industrial designer: Maybe if the , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . user interface: W industrial designer: So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . user interface: Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well . industrial designer: it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . I , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ? industrial designer: As far as I know . industrial designer: I thought that was project manager: But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic  user interface: Yeah , tha marketing: user interface: marketing: I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before . marketing: Yeah so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe . marketing: So , if it was running off of one battery as a user interface: That would be good yeah . user interface: Maybe we could you were saying about  solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . user interface: So maybe that could be incorporated as industrial designer: May maybe that could be the backup . user interface: Do , do those calculators industrial designer: s but some marketing: So , if we're doing user interface: yeah . If we're industrial designer: But thing is , it's not you don't need the solar all the time . It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . industrial designer: I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today . industrial designer: Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . industrial designer: You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . user interface: Do you think it's project manager: Yeah , 'cause industrial designer: So I suppose sometime project manager: I'm sorry ? industrial designer: after you . user interface: project manager: because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . user interface: So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . industrial designer: I s I suppose where   on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . industrial designer: I know we're not having that , but  a similar thing , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: you , they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . industrial designer: But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . project manager: Yeah , we'll be doing industrial designer: It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . It'd be more a command interface , and then industrial designer: I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that . marketing: So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ? industrial designer: I marketing: The infrared is like , that's considered a project manager:  ? user interface: No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per marketing: Okay . So when it says pointing device that doesn't include industrial designer: For inp user interface: Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen . user interface: But  I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , project manager: Yeah . project manager: What do you mean ? user interface: Like I can't think of an example , but Sort of like little pictures rather than project manager: Oh yeah , like how the buttons user interface: Like a little sound . project manager: So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ? user interface: Yeah m perha yeah . user interface: the co  we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control .  , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , target the design area of the interface .  We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful . So , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand . user interface: Does anyone have any questions ? project manager: Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look . marketing: so and , and we might , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . user interface: But  project manager: But what about the lighting up effect ? marketing: You mean different colours for the lighting or project manager: well , I thought we had  decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . industrial designer: So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . user interface: In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the  covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . project manager: If it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but user interface: Yeah . 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty .  , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates . And the recent fashion update , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .  , also , in contra  in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy .  So , my personal preferences here ,  of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . marketing: So maybe we I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . marketing: But I I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or project manager: But they still need to  fit into people's decor though .  we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . industrial designer: Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . user interface: marketing: industrial designer: But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . marketing: One thing I was thinking though is project manager: marketing: I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . marketing: that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . marketing: And , did you have any questions ? Pretty straightforward ? project manager: Yeah  industrial designer: Yeah . Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the industrial designer: I didn't for the first one . project manager: Does anyone know how to take it out of  , user interface: Just escape I think . industrial designer: Or do we just project manager: But would a backup really be necessary ?  will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's , industrial designer: I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , project manager: if there is backup . industrial designer: I think project manager: There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ? industrial designer: yeah . industrial designer: Is everyone happy with that ? marketing: So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? project manager: Yeah . And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so project manager: Right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , it was user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? industrial designer: so that's the simple . project manager: Would we need a more advanced one for  the lighting , the interior lighting system ? industrial designer: Yeah possibly . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: So , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need .  , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ? industrial designer: So th I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my  PowerPoint thing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component industrial designer: Your screen ? marketing: Think it was called command interface . What's that all about ? user interface: I think that is marketing: project manager: user interface: well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? project manager:  user interface: You know how  different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have . project manager: what are our choices here ? user interface: Well it's just  w where where shall we locate the buttons . What kind of functions wi shall we have ? project manager: You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ? industrial designer: The power . Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have industrial designer: May yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , it was minima marketing: Do you remember that ? industrial designer: well , it wasn't the l project manager: Yeah , it was hardly ever used really . Yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , user interface: Yeah , each television . I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , user interface: You don't change that often , yeah . industrial designer: doesn't it ? I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote . project manager: Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: So we're just going for power , channels , volume , project manager: Volume . Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style ,  user interface: Yeah . marketing: and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . user interface: It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though . project manager: Yeah , user interface: Do you know ? project manager: I don't , I it's , it's a problem with the international  appeal , I think . user interface: But we industrial designer: I've marketing: Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it ,  it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . project manager: Yep , and  the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . user interface: project manager: And , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . So , anyone else have something to say ? industrial designer: I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . industrial designer: Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that . But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ? marketing: Now do you guys need want an idea of how many  are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? industrial designer: Y Yeah . user interface: What I What I was thinking what do yous think of this ?  , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle . user interface: That's just industrial designer: We can have a look at those ideas , yeah . marketing: So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds <doc-sep>project manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first  marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager: What ? marketing: No ? project manager: I I think I will let  our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . The second concept is a fancy controller ,  so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,  they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g  industrial designer:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: It's very big , user interface: if you're project manager: yeah . marketing: user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . user interface: so maybe we should  use   technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and  gesture recognition . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but as the  expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface:  I think some time it's very  convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just  speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you have one brother and one sister marketing: Yeah project manager: and they want to watch their favourite  T_V_ programme , marketing: Yeah , but the project manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , industrial designer: Yeah but Yeah user interface: Yeah , it's very interesting . industrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I don't think it project manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , industrial designer: It's it's marketing: No . user interface: so it's c come to channel three , marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . user interface: I don't have to project manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager: Yeah , but one other question . marketing:  if you if if you use the basic user interface: No no we just  have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? Or ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's  because  this technology is   for limited wor or limited wor  lexical recognition , it's very project manager: Yeah , but   user interface: it's  yeah . It's marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . industrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem , user interface: No it's  Even for the f  because the the vocabulary the industrial designer: you know when you project manager: project manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that  Baba talked about is the international industrial designer: Yeah . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , the key , the key  the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some  adaptation marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or industrial designer: Yeah but you know . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . industrial designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe project manager: okay . user interface: Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah , but how will you user interface: So industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . industrial designer: because  the for example for Se user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to industrial designer: Oh really ? That's project manager: Oh . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , but we're marketing: No , but then it's it's like this  project manager: here it's  an object . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . user interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: No no it's n y if you lose it industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . project manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it we should give the  flexibility to the user and we think marketing: Okay , so you project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if  ,  I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , but marketing: But if if if it like doubles  industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . user interface: project manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that marketing:  industrial designer: It's not really the we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But  I think a user need user interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah user interface: Okay . user interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing: Cause for example yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but  we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah ,  project manager: You don't need to tune it . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's marketing: for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . marketing:  thi this  , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The then nn marketing: or user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See user interface: That's the same marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah .  , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two  project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: industrial designer: so . marketing: industrial designer: So I think project manager: I can industrial designer: Can you go to the next one ? I  it's not this one . industrial designer: It's  oth the oth so I marketing: industrial designer: It's the working design . project manager: It's okay industrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use project manager: industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager:  I think there's something wrong with your user interface: It did didn't r receive it . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with  user interface:  to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: exac marketing: project manager: You will had s some more information in industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with user interface: project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: industrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example  d  solar energy alimentation user interface: -huh . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have  both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities  for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: industrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . project manager: And what tha what about the  materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for industrial designer: or you know , you can have some project manager: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . project manager: And you think that we will be industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know  yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or  if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . industrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .  , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  i i it sounds good technically user interface:  . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Wha what we really see this year is that  everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then  if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion  from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: Spongy 'Kay . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like  industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like  industrial designer: Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be  enough to have something working well . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No wood but Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but  ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah ,  it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: Google and project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer:  maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface:  yes . industrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: so . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . And pf what can we think a supplement to marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something added value . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the  simple vocal commands recognition . project manager:  you will have to work more , Baba , on the  spongy way to to add spongy  touch to the buttons industrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and  the colour of the  the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . project manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us  modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach <doc-sep>project manager: So  who has the fir do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready ? marketing: I have a presentation , I'm just making this industrial designer: Yeah I think yeah the Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here project manager: Okay . Ah industrial designer: because it's really a a team  project with a team project manager: there is Matthew . industrial designer: user interface: So project manager: So did you manage  user interface: Yeah I sent you the slides , you didn't see them ? project manager: Oh yes I see him , good yes . Okay so this is just a presentation on  the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment .  can I just put this on ? So we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . We basically used  some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and  some research on the current design  and fashion trends that are out there at the moment  , industrial designer: marketing: and as part of this The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out .  That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last  aspect , it has to be easy to use . So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it  . This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours ,  eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . marketing:  I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . industrial designer: So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ? project manager: Spongy feel ? industrial designer:  about the feeling yeah  yo marketing: Well user interface: You can marketing: ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , industrial designer: Okay . marketing: So as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables  . Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . marketing: So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . marketing:  and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas .  we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost ,  that's one thing we could look at . There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , project manager:  . Yes well marketing: and then project manager: maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the marketing: yeah user interface: Yeah . marketing: and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate .  marketing: So does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? I think you project manager: Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on  the l the the look and feel of  I've it was a good idea maybe to to industrial designer: To let the people choose , you mean ? project manager: Yes the the the there are changeable covers , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete   new l line of  of supplies marketing:  . project manager:  it would be  very complicated  organisational industrial designer: marketing: Well we're selling so many units of this . This is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . industrial designer: Sure that fits the project manager: Yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get  after-sales marketing:  . project manager: That's a very good idea  And then  maybe  we can go a th Matthew's presentation because user interface: Yeah marketing: user interface: s project manager: the user interface: then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together . project manager: because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , industrial designer: Yeah yeah I agree . user interface: so  Okay so m so then the the idea of  having a remote is generally you have  different keys and  different structures , different forms , and  they could be like buttons and  they could be of  a varying sizes if you want to to  basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and  maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . user interface: So what I have found was that  currently  the they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the  g  s some  soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have marketing:  . user interface: and  There is also  a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like You can basically if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information . I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . user interface: Yeah yeah so you you you can just  because  as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , industrial designer: . user interface: even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to marketing:  . industrial designer: So what functionalities do you suggest for that ? For facing this problem ? user interface: So it it it's like it limited one . In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , marketing: Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , marketing:  . user interface: And  basically  it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and   you are having a universal remote control and you want to  you don't know really which functionality is now , so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , marketing: And  well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed  to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . user interface: I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , is   is a good idea , like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having ,  with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . user interface: I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that  they have  integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , industrial designer: marketing:  b user interface: and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , you know , and  marketing: But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary . user interface: Yeah you you won't be using it , so it's a limited vocabulary  thing , and very isolated word marketing:  . user interface: and it's  it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing marketing:  . user interface: which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like  it could indicate you're  it it could indicate what is cal like the  whether  you you have enough battery in your in your  remote , the blinking . user interface: At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also marketing: user interface: or industrial designer: And you want okay for coming back to one point marketing: Two thirty five supposed to finish . industrial designer: y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ? user interface: Yeah you can let them to do that . industrial designer: And  isn't that too difficult for the we want w I don't know if we still want the  R_C_ to be easy to use , marketing:  . user interface: N no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . user interface: Like for example  I would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user marketing:  . marketing: You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , industrial designer: A standard . project manager: maybe you can give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents . project manager: I'm sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again marketing:  . project manager: but it's it's it's the real We have to consider it . project manager: do we think these ideas an and my  sp speech recognition ,  maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the   the the the furry   case of the marketing:  . industrial designer: - yeah like I would say that for programming  keys , you said ,  it could be  easily  done within the the package of twel twelve Euros , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but for the A_S_R_ system ,  I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this user interface: We well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit industrial designer: We user interface: and you can  check how much how much they industrial designer: Exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , user interface: yeah yeah marketing:  . user interface: Maybe we can come we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , project manager:   . user interface: And also well you can think of having  since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some kind of indicator , marketing:  . user interface: so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ project manager:  . marketing: I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , project manager:  . user interface: So marketing: so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something . user interface: No actually i if i it is like you know it tells you  , it can be for two purposes , marketing:  . user interface: like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , marketing:  . user interface: which is having  which need just  six six volt  th sorry three volts  of D_C_ . user interface: It may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . user interface: And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something industrial designer: It's true . user interface: and it can change the colour depending on your  how much is the battery , well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to . user interface: Yeah so industrial designer: I don't know how if if I have time to talk about the project manager:  yes  I would user interface: You you have time some more ? Yep . So what I'm gonna present here is very   yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . industrial designer: So the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like , and  what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will  show you my preferences   at the end . So there are two  different types of   Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . industrial designer:  the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some  transistors with an that aims at communicating   the message and to to send the message to the  to the led that will  transmit to the receiver . And  yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components  . So you finding , just to say that the chip can detect  when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know ,  with a different sequence for each key , project manager: industrial designer: and   that's , with the components we will use , we will have different  messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger  . And  so I think for our design we want some b  programmable  you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_  high technology , user interface: Yeah  industrial designer: and this is important , and also we'll use  yeah like in any  high-tech  devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . industrial designer: So my personal design we need to find a solution what  what is the material of the cover we want to use . industrial designer: or you said that yeah you had some ideas  like fruit , veg or project manager: Well well industrial designer: I dunno . marketing: project manager: m m maybe m maybe we can give the  the  the case a very   normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . project manager: So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . So they also emailed me that  they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . And  very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . industrial designer: So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel  and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money  which is a higher price range alright . And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but I think  with twelve Euros  and if it's   made for  four million  items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . industrial designer: So to to sum up  we need yeah so I I just said that the components  the list of components  has to be  yeah listed and  and  assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . And  for the designing of the cove   cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with  the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert user interface: Sorry . user interface: Yeah so industrial designer: right ? user interface: of course for example  I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there , industrial designer: Yes . user interface: or if you want to store a programmes with a keys What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside W wh what industrial designer: Yeah it's kind of  simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . industrial designer: I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions user interface: Okay so industrial designer: of user interface: in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card . How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . project manager:  so I understand  when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can  implement several complicated  or advanced features . industrial designer: we could have  one main chip  that could handle ,  it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both  like scrolling wheels as well as  L_C_D_ project manager: project manager: when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget ,  maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features  which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . user interface: D well project manager: Do you think that's feasible ? user interface: Well I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know . user interface: Is it possible to fit in to that ? industrial designer: Yeah also thinking , I think both  if we had a budget of twenty twenty  Euros , it will be okay , user interface: Sorry . Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . project manager: wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . user interface: Yeah that's  that's something which I wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . For example if f if you want to put wood I wouldn't suggest for wood industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:  'cause it's I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood . user interface: It will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing , but project manager: Yes but I can I think  I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials marketing:  . user interface: it's  Yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for project manager: Do do you agree ? marketing:  yeah sure . industrial designer: Yeah but i it's a detailed  yeah yeah  plastic versus  wood , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and we need maybe to centre our description on  the the really the what buttons what  functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with  graphs or I don't know  user interface: Yeah . So  Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price . project manager: which can be later  fancied up with  with addit  additional  , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . Smooth keys with bigger s  So that you know The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , project manager:  . user interface: and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together marketing: So is there any of these that you're looking at particularly user interface: to marketing: or is this just ideas ? user interface: Oh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , marketing: user interface: and  now you can , for example , as I was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . user interface: At the same time , it is m more  like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all problem . user interface:  big keys may better for them actually and  marketing: You see ? industrial designer: I agree yeah , marketing: Yeah . marketing: one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom user interface: Yeah . marketing: so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys . project manager:  w but then you have still have  when you don't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control marketing:  . So maybe it's possible  , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are  buttons you don't use that much . industrial designer: That's what you mean ? project manager: Yes I I th that's what  user interface: Yeah . marketing: Can we have can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box industrial designer: Yeah I like also this one . industrial designer: Yeah , the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or marketing:   'kay . Is this for the next meeting though ? user interface: We should make a marketing: I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting . user interface: Yeah that yeah next meeting we should be project manager: Ju just make two designs , industrial designer: Okay . So is this is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ? project manager:  yes I come to that   user interface: Maybe it would be interesting if you could look  for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that . project manager: Yes well m maybe  , I don't know whether that's possible , marketing:  . marketing: Okay well is this me designing a way to evaluate it so Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ? project manager: I don't know whether that's possible  in the given time marketing:  . project manager: So  you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes industrial designer: Exactly . user interface: One for like cost and the one with like higher-end industrial designer: Two ? project manager: I industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and then user interface: so that then we can be easily comparing them industrial designer: Yeah project manager:  . user interface: or you know find a compromise between both of them , industrial designer: and find maybe a compromise "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the features, functions, evaluation criteria, and usability of the remote control, as well as the functional features to include.",
        "Summary": "The group reached a consensus on the features of the new remote control, including the use of normal batteries, a scroll wheel with rubber buttons and backlights, a round shape, and speech recognition with an advanced chip. They decided to forgo an LCD display due to cost constraints. Marketing initially suggested developing a multi-functional remote control that could control various appliances, but ultimately decided to design it solely for television use. The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of a modern remote control being able to control a diverse range of equipment, which was agreed upon by the User Interface team. The group evaluated the remote control design based on user requirements and received a satisfactory average score of two. Marketing raised concerns about the ease of finding all the buttons, particularly the options button, while the Industrial Designer believed all the buttons were easier to find than a regular remote control. The team discussed the inclusion of a standard wheel, despite its higher cost, and debated whether to include a motion-activated light or continuous light.",
        "Article": "So , we will first start by summarizing the  the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .  I will take notes during this meeting so  that you can  look at my  folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . We'll then t take decision in concert and then   we will  define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . We have also  the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ user interface: Abdul al-Hasred is my name . industrial designer: I_D_ you want ? project manager: Maybe I can switch slide  on your request . industrial designer: and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the  the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a  a wheel control . So   I was looking basically for that chip , which is  very very standard , and  I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . industrial designer: And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . Yeah project manager: So will will will this with  including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be  lower than twelve Euros to produce ? industrial designer: I I th But I don't think that  we should We should talk about  the design of the box also which needs some money . project manager: Okay user interface: Also have to say industrial designer: But user interface: Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? industrial designer:  that's all user interface: No ? project manager: You received something industrial designer: yeah . But I guess it could be project manager: And could it be adapted ? user interface: I guess it's possible . project manager: Okay and there can  recognize some commands and stuff ? user interface: Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as  as a chip project manager: Okay . project manager: Okay maybe we can just  listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . industrial designer: Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry , I haven't written my personal references .  the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , project manager: Okay .  , what is the purpose of the light ? industrial designer: Just to to make something which is  slightly more design that  a squarey box with a rubber user interface: Is project manager: You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? user interface: But But in th in the dark  Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? project manager: It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ? user interface: But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . user interface: But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . industrial designer: I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but  the bill starts to be user interface: Okay . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , industrial designer: First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light user interface: yeah . industrial designer: and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device user interface:  . project manager: But it can be  battery consuming , no ? To have the light always on ? industrial designer: Yeah , a little bit . user interface: So I just look at some current designs  on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because  th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just  reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . project manager: And also does it  fit well in hand ? Because it was  th your wrist problem with the usage . We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . user interface: So , from the bottom or whatever is there ,  the  the numbers and then the top ,  until the ten also , this middle part , project manager: Yeah . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . user interface: Yeah , if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . Will be down or user interface: So that they're separate a bit , project manager: Okay .  and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but  , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t  tuning the channels and stuff like that . user interface: We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . user interface:  so we could just basically use one just wheel and  user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . So we can move to the Is there any question ? For designer of user interface ? or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? Okay . marketing: Can I ? So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control  . So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . marketing: And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends ,  fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form project manager: Okay . project manager: marketing:  I don't know which material can be spongy , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and if you project manager: This is good also for user interface: Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , industrial designer: Yeah . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is  technological innovative , and after the easy to use . marketing: Yeah that's why project manager: Has it ? marketing: Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand project manager: Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well . D D Is is there anything you want to add ? user interface: Is there any fruit that is spongy ? marketing: project manager: I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . industrial designer: And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ? project manager: But that's not in the trend . user interface: You can make it  marketing: project manager: The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . marketing: project manager: I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . project manager: So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's  easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit  any others idea you have . What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? marketing: user interface:  . industrial designer: You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , user interface: Two of the button , yeah . industrial designer: but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and here you have a a push button to marketing: But you don't have project manager: I think it's a good idea , yeah . user interface: Yeah so you can just have  just have this curve , yeah , and you move  your hand here to press the buttons and then you move  on the other side . user interface: So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool , project manager: Yeah . user interface: no ? project manager: I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . industrial designer: If you if you start with  fancy fruits and fra s and tha user interface: Ah-ha . industrial designer: Oh , yeah marketing: project manager: Yeah it's really  really a good point . marketing: user interface: Now who are recording this meeting ? project manager: I think it So One second . So ,  so for marketing: project manager: sorry , for  component , so industrial designer: So project manager: we have to think about those aspects , sorry .  what do you mean by case ? project manager: I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . project manager: industrial designer: I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . user interface: But  the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be industrial designer: Spongy also . user interface:  if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to  if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot . user interface: So if we try to push the buttons , it project manager: No the button would be user interface: You think it's possible ? project manager: In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . Button , where do we want some buttons ? user interface: Well , usually hold 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ? industrial designer: Yeah . Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is  yeah also the thumb . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . user interface: This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? project manager: Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . user interface: So if the left , we have the op project manager: I think you can turn it this way also . user interface: Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . project manager: And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . user interface: So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know , but  if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . project manager: So , for interface we said also that we have  this banana shape with button on the s on the side . I think it's  we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah . That is to say ,  check if it fit the the requirement  given by the users , but according to  your presentation it seems to be okay . project manager: So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer  work together . project manager: You feel  free to express what you want to say ? You don't feel too constrained ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: user interface: Maybe you can make    project manager: Okay , so user interface: okay <doc-sep>project manager:  as you may have noticed I  user interface: industrial designer: project manager: created separate folders because it was  tending to get a little busy in our  shared project documents  folder . project manager: I don't know if everybody  put their own  documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting . user interface: Didn't we just do that ? industrial designer: Yeah , save in the folder . project manager: Oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  what are we going to do ? I've opened it already .  I'm still going to take some minutes , and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? industrial designer: Oh , sorry . And  then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance  aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , user interface: Oops . project manager: and if we can we can  commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , but  industrial designer: Okay ? user interface: Any questions so far ? marketing: Big microphone . user interface: Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and  industrial designer: Do not forget it .  using the scroll button on sides  y  I   user interface: You push the scroll button industrial designer: Yeah , you push the scroll button user interface: and it's claps out if there's a industrial designer: and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and  you get  you get the options  becoming available . industrial designer: So  you can scroll down too with the scroll  button ,  as you can see oh , it's here , just push it in ,  the menu comes out like this and  i it all becomes visible . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , industrial designer: Yeah , that's c user interface: and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers . industrial designer: Okay ,  it's also  nice to see that  we made a small  menu ,  the options menu  becoming available when pressing the  scroll  button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used  which should still be used and we think that it's  very handy to put it  not  under the options menu , but in  Yes . project manager: So a separate button for for text , industrial designer: In a separate button , yeah . Would you like to make any comments about next  user interface:  well , this is the total interface  that f of the L_C_D_ screen . just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . marketing: user interface: And this is the  the on off  knop , the stand by  knop . You can see very clearly now that the  teletext and options menu isn't  taking  much   it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very  when you  when you use it , doesn't  become irritating to see . industrial designer: 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . industrial designer: project manager: And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for ? industrial designer: user interface: That's the logo of the project manager: Logo , okay . It's th th right now it's only R_ R_ , but  marketing: project manager: Okay well industrial designer: Full screen . 'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , user interface: Right . marketing: like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . marketing: The three important things of refa are  from th of this year is are , industrial designer: Sorry , user interface: industrial designer: you used the PowerPoint marketing: is the remote control fancy enough , user interface: Yeah . Is the design fancy enough ? user interface: Well marketing: Project Manager , what do you think ? project manager: Well it's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . project manager: Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? user interface: It  oh it's in the background . industrial designer: Now  the single curved idea was  Yeah , okay , you ge  user interface: Y you should make  a sideways  view . user interface: So it would be  something like this from the side , but with a bit of  curve here , industrial designer: it works . industrial designer: That's not very i it's also  very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom  at a bottom at a bottom .  make it  rather thick on the top , because  on the top it has  the screen , which takes  in some  space , and the batteries can be located over there , user interface: Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , industrial designer: so  user interface: so that it lays a bit o industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , that's a bit of problem maybe . marketing: With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think user interface: Yeah . I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay , but we have to rate  these things now ? user interface: 'Cause otherwise I think i marketing: Yeah , we have to rate . user interface: I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . marketing: I think Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Well I think  especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . marketing: Yeah , I n used I wouldn I should use that one , but it doesn't industrial designer: user interface: But it's a one  Maybe  marketing: Okay , no it's two ? True is a one . marketing: Very true , is it very true or isn't that true ? project manager: Well I'd say two on a scale user interface: Well they think it's very true , but  industrial designer: It's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , marketing: Yeah , I think two . user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: so user interface: but industrial designer: It's very fancy , I think . user interface: We should perhaps industrial designer: Have you ever seen a remote control like this ? project manager: No , okay well , that's true . marketing: Then ? project manager: That doesn't matter that much , so make it a one . project manager: Yeah user interface: because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone . project manager: m industrial designer: And   the scroll is rubber , user interface: It's from rubber . Also huh -huh the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people . industrial designer: With the ones marketing: Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons , all the buttons . user interface: but if you touch the options then it's  industrial designer: Take a harder look , yeah , sure . marketing: I think th it's industrial designer: It's easier than the regular  remote control . marketing: easy t project manager: Yeah , and you use these buttons the most , marketing: Yeah , I think this is easy now . I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to project manager: huh ? So industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: No they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find . industrial designer: Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than  th than on the regular remote controls marketing: I would rate it a user interface: Oh . project manager: So industrial designer: So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most project manager: which marketing: But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text . project manager: Two , three and industrial designer: It's not perfect , but marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And why is that ? marketing: I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . user interface: Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . marketing: Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , user interface: Yeah . user interface: You can touch options project manager: A two , okay , user interface: and it's comes out . project manager: It's the box below it , industrial designer:  the next question the next question . user interface: I think it's industrial designer: I think it's the most useful  remote control ever to be manufactured . project manager: Okay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design , marketing: Also if you're sixty years old project manager: huh ? industrial designer: Yeah , but because it has the regular  controls , li  as you can see in the screen now , and  you don't have all the other options  always  on your screen . You want these options to marketing: Also project manager: As well for the for the older people ? industrial designer:  sure . marketing: Yeah , as well as your if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand user interface: Yeah , but  Yeah , but they they don't want the  extra options , right ? marketing: No , but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , user interface: So project manager: And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? user interface: Yeah , okay , marketing: so it it it has to be user interface: but so they could  I think it is . project manager: Because that might marketing: If you read the manual , user interface: Yeah , alright . user interface: Because it it's not it's not it's it's not  difficult . industrial designer:  because a lot of user interface: You say you say  record to to the to the speech recognition , industrial designer: Channel one , channel four , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . marketing: So industrial designer: Because all the people who can't  user interface: I would make it two . industrial designer: That's definitely our  user interface: Oh nee , oh seven is it ? It is . project manager: but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , marketing: Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . project manager: because otherwise we can't  calculate anything from the results , user interface: It's not overwhelmed . project manager: because we designed for that , huh ? marketing: Remote control has  colours that different that meet different target groups . project manager: Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours , marketing: That's true . project manager: but you can also make  a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , user interface: Yeah . project manager: can't you ? marketing: Also with rubber ? user interface:  I think you can . project manager: Whether it looks like wood , it isn't w it isn't wood marketing: Yeah , okay . project manager: but user interface: It it feels like rubber , project manager: You can make a print on rubber , user interface: but project manager: can't you ? Yeah . project manager: So that's a one then , user interface: Well but then when you scratch it it does come off . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: huh ? marketing: That's a one ? user interface: So that's a bit industrial designer: Yeah , it is it is harder to marketing: Okay . project manager: Do you have many questions ? marketing:  I have industrial designer: to like project manager: Oh , okay well marketing: user interface: Oh we have time . marketing: The material used is spongy , user interface: What ? marketing: that that's  that's a one , that's m rubber . marketing: Yeah , user interface: Oh marketing: I th think it's not the most spongy thing . user interface: but not it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . industrial designer: because you want to make it  rather flexible but not too flexible , user interface: Hard but Yeah . marketing: Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust  set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . user interface: Yeah , it it is there's the project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Isn't hard to lose . user interface: it's a six , you think ? industrial designer: Isn't hard to lose , yeah . marketing: Or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands project manager: Yeah , but a har A hard to lose is good . Yeah , so then this is it is almost true , industrial designer: This project manager: A two . marketing: Nah , the material isn't that user interface: It's it's much more younger . project manager: Well I think it's it's  a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , project manager: didn't we ? user interface: I think it's a two marketing: but I  user interface: but marketing: Okay , okay . project manager: What do you think ? marketing: I think because project manager: Questions ? industrial designer: A two ? I think it's two . user interface: What did marketing: Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . industrial designer: Well , n not exactly but   if it had some games on it or something like that , user interface: Yeah bu but industrial designer: but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs . You could call to your  industrial designer: Yeah , the speech possibility , user interface: yeah , and the screen , industrial designer: the colours . marketing: It's three features , basically , project manager: with marketing: the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature . user interface: aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , project manager: Yeah . user interface: Enough features ? marketing: So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one . I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b  you have the  screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . marketing: Has user interface:  it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ . user interface: Yeah , project manager: Yeah , user interface: but not R_ and R_ yellow I think . Well m th but the logo is on on the front , industrial designer: Okay , true , yeah . project manager: so a two , yeah , user interface: One d on i it's the colours and the marketing: X_ marks spot . project manager: that's marketing: And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . industrial designer: I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options  entirely explained . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Instead of  just finding out what an icon means on a button . Yeah ,  user interface: And you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_  remote . Well industrial designer: marketing: Let's go th for inhalation of air] user interface: Menu . project manager: Oh , well that's that's pretty good , user interface: We only have twos . project manager:  let's see oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already industrial designer: Yeah . Well , the next part  might be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it . marketing: project manager: Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that .  and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are  under or at twelve Euro fifty , user interface: Yeah . project manager: we're good , and if they're not we're going to  re-design , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but we have to do that  very very quick I think , user interface: So we're going to erase features or something .  I don't know if I user interface: Do you have the cost project manager: put the Excel sheet in the user interface: or  Let's hope . I think it's user interface: We're going to be here at eight o'clock . industrial designer: user interface: We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock . user interface: it was in my  my information , so  industrial designer: It i It wasn't too much . user interface: Well , if it doesn't work project manager:  maybe I could ask one of you to  fill it in , so that I can also  take minutes , user interface: I want to fill it in , but  project manager: and  maybe the other can  use that thing to count  numerous functions . user interface: But you should  direct marketing: Count it ? Li like write it be project manager: Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . user interface: The number of marketing: project manager: No ,  count  number of functions , because for every button you have to pay industrial designer: Oh okay . project manager: and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , industrial designer: Well I dra marketing: Ah , okay , cool . industrial designer:  Danny , Danny , I'll do that , marketing: Huh ? Yeah ? Oh , yea yeah , you design it .  industrial designer: because I draw the  project manager: so user interface: We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries . project manager: Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: Electronics , simple chip industrial designer: Hand marketing: We have user interface: advanced chip , right ? marketing: No , we have sample speaker . marketing: But b al but we also have sample speaker , do user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: But it isn't three dimensional , user interface: Oh the the industrial designer: it isn't curved in a l marketing: This one is user interface: it's not going to work  people . industrial designer: No no no , project manager:  rubber indeed ? industrial designer: single curved is like this .  that's the only curve you made , marketing: Yeah , bu what industrial designer: not th  curved like that . user interface: Thirteen ? marketing: There are two curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand . user interface: With a scroll wheel , industrial designer: Huh ? user interface: right ? Is he integrated ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu  makes possible to s user interface: Oh yeah , right , we want it to it's not it's not no . user interface: Oh , we don't have any buttons , so marketing: Eighteen and a half , user interface: Yeah , we need to  marketing: damn . industrial designer: Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window  button here and then  scroll down with the d with  with  the button . user interface: Yeah , but if you would i it is a new feature , it it's something special . industrial designer: Okay , so we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve . marketing: But w d wha user interface: No , the curve doesn't really industrial designer: 'S possible to lose curve . marketing: Was that does that mean to it , single curve ? industrial designer: Yeah , that's meant with scr  with s curve . industrial designer: If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . marketing: So we don't user interface: So we still marketing: Yeah , we also have to industrial designer: Is it possible to make user interface: Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? marketing: No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . user interface: No ? Ma y you just can't do that , or  industrial designer: No . project manager: And what did you change ? You changed the  scroll wheel user interface: We changed th project manager: and user interface: Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved . Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think project manager: point , so maybe you should should  user interface: No . marketing: That that's  user interface: Yeah , but it's t marketing: Yes , four points . user interface: Yeah , but it is  it it is a new feature , project manager: Or can't you ? user interface: it is something special . industrial designer: Yeah ,  becau  when you lose the marketing: Yeah , but what what else what else  do you want to scrap ? user interface: I don't know . project manager: Or make it on a hand dynamo , but I don't think that will work . industrial designer: marketing: Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? industrial designer: No , that's no . industrial designer: Make it w  when you made it    a remote control of wood ? user interface: We could make it titanium instead of rubber . project manager: Yeah , but  a wooden remote control only helps for  old people we discussed , user interface: Oh . Oh can I ask something ? project manager: yes ? user interface: What is special colour ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: this , we have to have that one too ? industrial designer: It isn't . user interface: Th then we still have too much marketing: Yeah , okay , user interface: if we use the  industrial designer: But m yeah , course , marketing: three . industrial designer: but user interface: Yeah , we we scrap that one ? industrial designer: What we'll have . marketing: Yeah , but a wood user interface: Make it  marketing: we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . user interface: Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it a all kind of colours ? industrial designer: Yeah , special colours , fruity colours . marketing: Normal colours , yellow user interface: You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . marketing: Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . user interface: Yeah , you can , you should you have to lose marketing: But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap  user interface: No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? industrial designer: If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally  depending  dependent on  the touch screen marketing: Five ? Then we have two . industrial designer: Okay , if you lose  if you lose the user interface: It was such a great idea . industrial designer: You lose this one , you got eleven point five marketing: They can add two colours .  how ma  the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or industrial designer: How d   how many colours ? user interface: What do you mean ? industrial designer: Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p marketing: Yeah , but we we we are we have yellow , red ,  black , titanium . industrial designer: Yeah , but  when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . user interface: But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , industrial designer: I suppose . marketing: Yeah b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow  red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . project manager: Yeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special project manager: Half ? user interface: Oh right , yeah . industrial designer: You don't need four of those  four of those special colours in one in one remote . industrial designer: project manager: Because of thing user interface: Or not ? project manager: Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again . project manager: Because that was very important , user interface: It's too bad for the speaker . project manager: huh ? So it's curved , it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . user interface: Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , marketing:  yep . user interface: or not ? Could you copy it ? project manager: And the rest is the same , user interface: And make it  project manager: huh ? Am I right ? marketing: Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . user interface: Would you ? industrial designer: Twenty minutes ? user interface: By the Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . industrial designer: Okay , so you had this list at start ? project manager:  ? No , I hadn't .  and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ? user interface: Yeah , I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work . project manager: Oh , you can arrange industrial designer: You can only re erase ? user interface: Erase . user interface: When you saw th li  Earlier when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything . user interface: project manager: Well but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think  we have a prototype now marketing: Evaluation drops . project manager: which we can afford and  we only need to draw a little bit to get a good  design . user interface: marketing: industrial designer: project manager: Let's see , we can save this now .  what did you think about  the process ? How satisfied are we ? industrial designer: Deadlines were sometimes very short . marketing: I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . user interface: Yeah , you had information I didn't have marketing: something he said user interface: and then  marketing: yeah , and you had information I also had , user interface: Oh right . marketing: so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: So yeah , that I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . industrial designer: but but why not work here together , for example ? user interface: Yeah , you could industrial designer: Why should we be separated from each other in those difference  different rooms ? user interface: Yeah . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , project manager: No . I don't think that was the best way , but industrial designer: But the technology was  fantastic . user interface: I I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . industrial designer: Work now ? marketing: Yeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because industrial designer: Perhaps it is e user interface: It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't  industrial designer: Yeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those  dig digital pens or so and to  and lay it next to that keyboard over there . project manager: So you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful user interface: But project manager: or user interface: Well industrial designer: It's useful , but not m user interface: it is useful , marketing: Yeah , it is useful , but user interface: but it doesn't really work all the time . user interface: Th the pen doesn't industrial designer: Because when you put this pen on the screen   for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres  below . But industrial designer: The project  because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to  have , you didn't have time to  to make a very  qualitati qualitative  presentation . industrial designer: So you used  this  the different PowerPoint presentations  in which you put your  material in the Oh . project manager: the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about  this digital pen ? user interface: I I I used it , marketing: I didn't use it at all . project manager: Yeah , well industrial designer: But I didn't I  project manager: I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to  get it on the computer , user interface: Yeah , I used it to y to project manager: huh ? user interface: Yeah , it did work pretty well . user interface: I don't think why you would want to use it actually , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: To make some designs , marketing: It is it is industrial designer: it is very easy . user interface: It's a bit industrial designer: Yeah , it's too big , it's too fat . industrial designer: project manager: Okay ,  and what about the teamwork ? user interface: I think it was great , marketing: Team work was okay . project manager: but that was it was our assignment , marketing: With some things that was only problem , user interface: Yeah , but it was because we didn't  marketing: but project manager: huh ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss  this point , the leadership . project manager: And creativity ? Well , when we look at this I'd say we have been creative , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: huh ? But user interface: Well . industrial designer: Yeah , or the room for project manager: There was room for industrial designer: it was the idea to be creative , so user interface: Yeah . user interface: but industrial designer: The information  was sometimes  a little bit too late marketing: Little bit  lo yeah . industrial designer: or marketing: it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema user interface: You just sit there for ten minutes . user interface: project manager: You did ? Well , user interface: Oh industrial designer: project manager: I didn't have time for that . user interface: did you ? Is it on there ? Is it on there ? marketing: Wha user interface: I didn't find the didn't look but  project manager: At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment , industrial designer: Was searching and searching . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: I always user interface: I got like one email after ten minutes or something . marketing: So does this I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes , user interface: And it not a lot  marketing: in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do . industrial designer: No , w I didn't know user interface: I didn't know  marketing: Yeah , like I with with the remote and I never new we have t we had to  yeah made a made a rec a remote control . user interface: And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , marketing: Yeah , so user interface: so I went , right . project manager: And I was working and working and work user interface: Just looking at the screen and  industrial designer: No . project manager: but after all we can say  we are satisfied , but it it could've been  better . industrial designer: First of all I didn't think  that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen  first point , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yea  so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . project manager: And  what were the other points to to improve this whole process ? marketing: user interface: I dunno . project manager: And so more time  w might have improved the the quality of work , marketing: So project manager: is what you say . Yeah , but that It's now half past four half past three , so user interface: Yeah , but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone . project manager: I just got my warning for the last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess my last slide , user interface: You did ? Well marketing: project manager: yes , which is the closing . I don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , user interface: Oh , right . project manager: but we had to do it , user interface: Well project manager: huh , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . Maybe we should re-evaluate  the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . At least I am , with the results , user interface: project manager: so  celebration , well , for the three of you , user interface: Yeah . marketing: project manager: But  well , thank you very much for your co-operation , marketing: project manager: and I had a very nice day so far . user interface: I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again , project manager: Yeah I have t user interface: but project manager: I think we also have to go to our own rooms again , but  well user interface: We do ? industrial designer:  . But maybe you can try  to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report . user interface: Yeah , but it's it isn't a picture or , well , is it ? project manager: I know , we should remove this , industrial designer: You s  file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG . marketing: Can you find it as a J_ PEG ? user interface: No , industrial designer: No . marketing: Celebra user interface: How big do you want the images ? marketing: Or shouldn't I ? industrial designer: Let's have some fun <doc-sep>industrial designer: How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? project manager:  well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: You have the same message of  Windows cannot  marketing: user interface: sen oh stand-by . user interface: project manager:  I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .  Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here  in the role of Industrial Designer . project manager:  we're going to do    a little tool training  for the tools we are going to use  during  the meetings we are going to have here .  then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,  and we will have a discussion .  is there any room for a little presentation ?  maybe during the discussion  section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it <doc-sep>So does anyone have any  thoughts as to the tool training that  is required ? industrial designer: Tool training user interface: I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training . user interface: marketing: project manager: Oh I see , so we shouldn't really be Oh right okay , so . So we have the project team , which is to  basically to come up with a new r remote control device . industrial designer: project manager:  we have  the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time . And  our idea is to  to make the new remote control device  more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to  to get a bigger market share and bigger audience . project manager: So  method of doing this is  split up as you can see into  the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . So  in each of these  phases we'll  basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this  this device . project manager: And  having  meetings so that we can  during the course of the day  come up with a better better inst implement than we had before . marketing: user interface: project manager: Right so everyone's to  supposedly  draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . marketing: Your microphone's just project manager: I take it that user interface: Are we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ? project manager: I would I would guess so .  and this would be because they're very independent ,  they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe . I'll I'll user interface: Shall I rub that out , actually ? project manager: I don't see as there's any need to . project manager: We've had more time to prepare over this side , industrial designer: There's one . I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm be able to draw very well , project manager: You get marks for artistic impression . user interface: project manager: user interface: marketing: industrial designer:  and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because  I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that . And they're always happy , so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always  quite excited . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: Okay , that's why I like dogs . Well I've not actually had too many pets  over my  time 'cause to be honest with you  I'm not too keen on them anyway . So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got  a few fish and so hopefully  won't prove too difficult to draw . And  one of the best  things about fish is that they don't really take  too much looking after because  with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the  couple of weeks that you're away and  change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . Other than the fact that they keep dying , industrial designer: project manager:  fish are  are not are are are reasonable pets in that  they're low maintenance . And therefore making a profit margin of  well not actually a profit margin it's  because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to  take  from  from that to give you your profit margin per unit . And so depending what the  the overhead  costs are will determine  how many units we're  looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time . So I guess we're looking at  having a discussion at this point in time to help  you  folks design our our new model as it were . project manager: So  any any thoughts ? industrial designer:  I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with  easy to press buttons . project manager: Okay , so so basically we're looking for some  we're looking for a device that is  robust and and therefore  won't get damaged too easily . project manager:  we're looking for a device that is  What was the other things you said there ? industrial designer:  sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible . user interface: Can I just check ? Is this just a television remote ? Because a lot of  systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now , or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined . industrial designer: user interface: Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ? marketing:  . industrial designer: project manager: But it seems to me sensible , user interface: project manager: 'cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the  about the room .  one of the things  we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . And  sometimes  they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how  we could maybe  develop a remote control which moves around the room . marketing: That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but industrial designer: Yeah . You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to marketing: Yeah . project manager: 'cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . project manager:  you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more with handling them , industrial designer: Yeah . Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ? project manager: Better instructions .  we've done some research  about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops . marketing: So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well , maybe . project manager: So  Right , so we've got I_D_ the Come on , where's my marketing: If you just click return it should be okay . So we've got function Oh what happened to the user interface: I think that might be back to the start . marketing: project manager: Okay , so we've got  the working design for I_D_ . Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ? industrial designer: project manager: And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of  this meeting to  to give it to you for the next meeting . user interface: I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for . user interface: Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ? industrial designer: I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , project manager: Television remote control . project manager: That's true , 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going . project manager: But at this point in time I think you're right that  shall we make it just a T_V_ <doc-sep>user interface: Why won't it wake up ? Is it on ? marketing: The power light doesn't work . Okay , so I just show you the m the no   the the the the the the minutes , minute . project manager: Okay , so we just talked about  Oh you want me to show that there or user interface: No , industrial designer:  no . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute  button , and a text T_V_ button . project manager: So I just want to give you  Mike again , the first  presentation of your marketing: Shall I start ? project manager: Yeah . I searched the web ,  and  I searched  on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .  but  they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . And then  that  This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of  L_C_D_ or  speech recognition . marketing: But  this is the second  important  aspect , and I think  we must use some of the new technology , to be  innovative . And it says  fashion-watchers of   Pari  France and  Italy , yeah ,  have detected the following trends . marketing: But the  the next  aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe   is expected to be spongy . marketing: But spongy , what what does spongy says ? industrial designer: Spongy . project manager: because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . project manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ? user interface: How are you gonna make it ? project manager: R_ soft . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing:  industrial designer: I've some  material  information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation . marketing: Okay ? project manager: marketing: What do I think ?  because a fancy look is the most important thing  for remote control  control , I think about changeable fronts . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget . marketing: Intro project manager: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . user interface: So  industrial designer: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: and it's easy to implement . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so  but  marketing: user interface: if we implement  speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . So you can say , you can user interface: Since you have to  configure speech thing . project manager: But that's definitely more expensive than user interface: Yeah , that's that's something I dunno . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . user interface: Yeah , so  we gotta de project manager: So  user interface: We have to decide on that . That was this ? user interface:   industrial designer: Oh I got an email  And it says  the chip can be  simple , regular or advanced . So user interface: L_D_C_ doesn't require industrial designer: it's m the most expensive . industrial designer: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but user interface: I'll I'll give you my design . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . project manager: Yeah , maybe the teletext tel user interface: Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . user interface: but it's marketing: No , I don't  I don't like it . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . industrial designer: Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . user interface: They're on top ? project manager: Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . industrial designer: But I I think w you'll use  the switch channels buttons  more often than the normal  channel buttons , like one two three . I dunno , but yeah we'll industrial designer: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . user interface: And  if you don't light 'em up , they don't  you don't see 'em very good . industrial designer: That's that's good , but user interface: I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . It's s We have to look  what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . user interface: I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . Yeah , maybe industrial designer: But  we we can switch those two , user interface: Those two , yeah . user interface: And  , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to  Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . And  well  if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to  switch it open . project manager: We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this  fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of project manager: Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . user interface:  Yeah , it's project manager: So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . industrial designer: Yeah ,  n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . user interface: Yeah , but  I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But project manager: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but user interface: Yeah , okay . user interface:  can't we use  different  fron  fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So project manager: Yeah , it's cool . industrial designer: S user interface: You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make  different fronts on it . user interface: A more Yeah , just  marketing:   project manager: That's better prob industrial designer: With the hard hard buttons . The the the new  new modern  remote controls ,  the buttons are part of the  the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .  it's n doesn't Is  a button   How do you say it ? industrial designer: Yeah , it's it's all on one level . marketing: It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background . project manager: basic remote control from normal plastic , marketing: project manager: and industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . industrial designer: So if you put project manager: Y i if you The numbers could be can be user interface:  you can just make them around the buttons  project manager: Yeah , that's right . user interface: Or it runs the whole industrial designer: Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . user interface: Yeah , you can halfs transparent , industrial designer: Or no user interface: or just that it's comes out a bit . user interface:  depends on the colour of the project manager: Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . Is marketing: but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? user interface: Yeah , it can . project manager: industrial designer: I don't know what it is , but it should be there I think . marketing: project manager: user interface: industrial designer:  this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of  things . project manager: Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so industrial designer: W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . user interface: industrial designer:  they they basically said that that's almost the same on any  remote controls . project manager: We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? industrial designer: Yeah but project manager: Is that still the user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it ? Accu . user interface: project manager: It's just batteries , industrial designer: so marketing: project manager: that's cheaper . So we need  the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . industrial designer:  are are we using a a rubber case , or project manager: Oh just sk industrial designer: We haven't decided yet . It's user interface:  I don't think a rubber case looks industrial designer: L marketing:  but we have to do something about the trend . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? user interface:  I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . industrial designer: So we should did it here ? project manager: That's for th user interface: So we're staying here ? project manager:  that I think that's the next next meeting . user interface: Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those . You see what  ? industrial designer: What ? project manager: If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than industrial designer: Oh . industrial designer: I think  you'll get a a lot of  volume changing when it's not wanted . project manager: And industrial designer: Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . user interface: Yeah , maybe you just have to make it  That's not scrollable too easy . And  what's the channel choose ? Where do we  put that ? Still on the bottom industrial designer: I think in middle . project manager: or user interface:  wh what is the middle part ? project manager: That's the numbers . industrial designer:  I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . project manager: It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s  the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . user interface: Use the dz project manager: Because you already have the volume here , so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . project manager: So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . industrial designer: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . project manager: But that's not want to zap very quick , so user interface: Yeah , I think  zapping is the highest priority . project manager: Yeah ? Is this a opportunity , user interface: And then you use those  project manager: or you don't want a different user interface: Yeah , of course  . industrial designer:  but I think we we should bu  put 'em on top of each other , so project manager: Why ? industrial designer: Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up project manager: But still the next It's still the next one . Doesn't make industrial designer: Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is If you put them project manager: Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . industrial designer: But  but I I think  left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with  channel changing . user interface: Yeah , I think industrial designer: So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning  time . I You already have the volume on the side , user interface: No ,  I think project manager: so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . project manager: So it's  user interface: I think it's s so simple industrial designer: I dunno . user interface: you just project manager: So but that's for that's for you , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: 'cause it's user interface: Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . user interface: Think we need to work  thirty minutes again ? marketing: Yeah , we have to care that it r  looks really new . marketing: 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . user interface: No , you have  It is industrial designer: Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . marketing: Some some kind of bling bling   can we have industrial designer: user interface: Where you can put a ve  we have If we do it like that we have below have we  a lot of room to put a nice logo . marketing:  and how many  fronts  fronts do we put on the market then ?  five or something ? project manager: Yeah , five . user interface: marketing: Or more or user interface: Maybe you can buy separate ones and  marketing: And    buy the product . industrial designer: No , tha that will be project manager: So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ? user interface: Yes . marketing: Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet . industrial designer: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . user interface: I think i marketing: user interface: Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . industrial designer: Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of  As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . project manager: industrial designer: project manager: It's a bit annoying , isn't it ? marketing: Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but marketing: Yeah , it project manager: industrial designer: Like in this kind of shape or marketing:  it's very annoying . project manager: So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . project manager: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of Skip that one as well . user interface: and marketing: It's not not a lot of trends I  I found  project manager: Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just marketing:  project manager: I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . Yeah , marketing: It The th th industrial designer: I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand  stuff . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal industrial designer: Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public . marketing: There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can  make it look not like the iPod itself . But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now project manager: But i it is it is it is already fancy . user interface: And if you make it look like the iPod marketing: Yeah , they're all the same . So that's already a very big change project manager:  maybe maybe make the the  the wha what's it called  scroll wheel . Maybe we have to ask  to the the  to her if it has if it can work better than this . project manager: We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think project manager: Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a industrial designer: S user interface: Well  project manager: advanced chip . marketing:  industrial designer: And we we have to build in a microphone and user interface: Well that's very easy . We already have  the beeping of the home station , industrial designer: Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that . user interface: so industrial designer: I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , marketing: No . Becau project manager: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , marketing: Yeah . But project manager: okay ? user interface: So marketing: Ma user interface: shall we it open then ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Oh yeah , I marketing: But we don't have any f information about the cost . marketing: We started with information about the cost was now th user interface: I just I just received the industrial designer: Yeah ,  I have I have some some information about the cost . marketing: And how much is the chip ? The the the industrial designer: I don't know how much , but user interface: Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . industrial designer: Just in inexpensive or user interface: This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . user interface: Yeah  th that's just It's a marketing: Does it say does it say something back ? project manager: Okay , we have to stop it now . Yeah , it Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . project manager: Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced industrial designer: But i it's a separate chip . user interface: I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . industrial designer: Yeah , I don't know anything about this , marketing:  project manager: Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , industrial designer: but Nah . project manager: Okay , just user interface: And there's a chip in it that will project manager: We have to stop it now "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion about electronics, the segment, the results from the experiments, and the topic of intentionality.",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the best approach for incorporating the recording infrastructure in the room, considering options such as placing tapes in the lip of the table and using LEDs to indicate when the channel is live. Power issues were also a topic of discussion. In terms of representing the Bayes-net, an alternative approach was proposed that depicts context features as classes and their dependencies as relations. This model allows for instantiations of classes, which aligns better with the research objectives compared to the extended belief-net. Recent experiments revealed that adding more languages had a detrimental effect on model performance. However, it was noted that any form of normalization had a positive impact, while MSG had no effect. A demonstration was given on the structure and function of a toy version of the belief-net for the intentionality task. The feature nodes included prosody, discourse, verb choice, the \"landmark-iness\" of a building, time of day, and whether the admission fee was discussed.",

Do we do do we have a spare ,  grad a: And I 'm getting lots of responses on different ones , so I assume the various and assorted P Z Ms are on . undergrad d: We ' r we 're we ' r This is this this is a meeting meeting . postdoc e: This is abou we 're we 're mainly being taped but we 're gonna talk about , transcription for the m future meeting meetings . grad a: Right , Dan ? undergrad d: So , I don't understand if it 's neck mounted you don't get very good performance . grad a: What are you doing ? undergrad d: Cuz when you do this , you can Rouww - Rouww . postdoc e: Why didn't I you were saying that but I could hear you really well on the on the transcription on the , tape . grad a: Well , I m I would prefer that people wore it on their head phd b: I I don't know . grad a: It 's very badly designed so it 's phd b: It 's very badly designed ? undergrad d: What do you mean it doesn't go over the ears ? phd b: Why ? It 's not s It 's not supposed to cover up your ears . grad a: Yeah but , there 's nowhere to put the pad so it 's comfortable . phd b: it 's only badly postdoc e: So that 's what you 're d He 's got it on his temples so it cuts off his circulation . grad a: Well , you know , I 'm just that sort of digit - y g sorta guy . phd b: We didn't postdoc e: Now , just to be sure , the numbers on the back , this is the channel ? phd b: That 's the microphone number . phd b: Transcript number phd c: OK , this is Eric on microphone number three , undergrad d: This is Beck on mike four . Should I turn off the VU meter Dan ? Do you think that makes any difference ? phd b: Oh , God . grad a: Why ? Are you gonna do something other than hit \" quit \" ? phd b: No , but I 'm gonna look at the  , logs as well . postdoc e: you said turn off the what ? grad a: The VU meter which tells you what the levels on the various mikes are and there was one hypothesis that perhaps that the act of recording the VU meter was one of the things that contributed to the errors . undergrad d: Yeah , but Eric , you didn't think that was a reasonable hypothesis , right ? postdoc e: I See . grad a: That was me , undergrad d: Oh , I 'm sorry y grad a: I thought that was undergrad d: That was malarkey . undergrad d: Are - are yo are you recording where the table mikes are by the way ? phd b: No . undergrad d: Why not ? phd b: I think , I s I spoke to somebody , Morgan , about that . undergrad d: Why don't you just do this ? grad a: that 's what we 've done before . phd b: I know what they they 're they 're four , three , two , one . grad a: Which means we need to move this thing , and sorta decide how we 're actually going to do things . phd b: It 'll be a lot easier if we have a if we have them permanently in place or something like that . undergrad d: Is this b is this being recorded ? grad a: That 's right . undergrad d: I think Lila actually is almost getting r pretty close to even getting ready to put out the purchase order . grad a: OK , so , topic of this meeting is I wanna talk a little bit about transcription .  , I 've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services and Jane has been working on doing transcription .  , and so we wan wanna decide what we 're gonna do with that and then get an update on the electronics , and then , maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools , and so on .  , you know , eventually we 're probably gonna wanna distribute this thing and we should decide how we 're gonna how we 're gonna handle some of these factors . phd b: Distribute what ? grad a:  ? phd b: The data ? grad a: Right .  , so we 're we 're collecting a corpus and I think it 's gonna be generally useful . grad a: and so we will undergrad d: u Using , like , audio D V Ds or something like that ? grad a: Excuse me ? phd b: Yes . Yeah , audio D V C Ds , undergrad d: Or t grad a: you know . grad a: And and so how we do we distribute the transcripts , how do we distribute the audio files , how do we how do we just do all that infrastructure ? phd c: Well , I think  , for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to to find these kind of things like the LDC for instance . postdoc e: Yeah , grad a: Right , but but so should we do it in the same format as LDC postdoc e: that 's right . grad a: and what does that mean to what we 've done already ? phd b: Right . The It 's not so much the actu The logistics of distribution are secondary to preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution . So , as it is , it 's sort of a ad - hoc combination of stuff Dan set and stuff I set up , which we may wanna make a little more formal . phd b: And the other thing is that , University of Washington may want to start recording meetings as well , grad a: Right . phd b: in which case w w we 'll have to decide what we 've actually got so that we can give them a copy . So I have a bunch of scripts with X Waves , and some Perl scripts , and other things that make it really easy to extract out and align where the digits are . And if U d UW 's going to do the same thing I think it 's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well . grad a: And what I 've done is pretty ad - hoc , so we might wanna change it over to something a little more standard . undergrad d: An - and there 's interest up there ? grad a: What 's that ? undergrad d: There 's interest up there ? grad a: Well they they certainly wanna collect more data . grad a: And I would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room .  , one of the things Morgan and I were talking about is we 're gonna get to know this room really well , phd c:   undergrad d: Did you notice the fan difference ? phd b: Oh , now you 've touched the fan control , now all our data 's gonna be undergrad d: Hear the difference ? grad a: Oh , it 's enormous . undergrad d: Do you wanna leave it off or not ? postdoc e: That 's better . phd b: That 's undergrad d: Yeah , the You sure ? phd b: Oh , yeah . phd b: So it could be that it 's not actually wired backwards undergrad d: That 's right . phd c: It would you know , it would real really mean that we should do short meetings when you turn off the turn off the air conditioning , grad a: Carbon monoxide poisoning ? undergrad d: Short meetings , that 's right . undergrad d: Actually , the a th air the air conditioning 's still working , that 's just an auxiliary fan . grad a: So phd c: So , in addition to this issue about the UW stuff there was announced today , via the LDC , a corpus from I believe Santa Barbara . phd c: And I don't know exactly how they recorded it but apparently there 's a lot of different styles of speech and what not . phd c: And postdoc e: They had people come in to a certain degree and they and they have DAT recorders . Right ? postdoc e: I I assume so , actually , I hadn't thought about that . Unless they added close field later on but , I 've listened to some of those data and I , I 've been I I was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up . phd b: What 's it sound like ? postdoc e: I 'm glad to see that it got released . grad a: Yeah , I I wish postdoc e: So it it 's a very nice thing . grad a: I wish we had someone here working on adaptation phd c: S grad a: because it would nice to be able to take that stuff and adapt it to a meeting setting . You know phd c: But it may be it may be useful in postdoc e: How do you mean do you mean mechanical adaptation or grad a: No , software , to adapt the speech recognition . phd c: Well , what I was thinking is it may be useful in transcribing , if it 's far field stuff , grad a:   phd c: right ? In doing , some of our first automatic speech recognition models , it may be useful to have that kind of data postdoc e: Great idea . grad a: Well that 's not good , right ? phd c: That 's that 's not great . postdoc e: It sounds undergrad d: Tr postdoc e: well but what  is that ,  undergrad d: But far field means great distance ?  grad a: Just these . undergrad d: And so that 's why they 're getting away with just two channels or something , or are they using multiple DATs ? postdoc e: oh , good question and I can't ans answer it . grad a: So we can get that just with , media costs , undergrad d: Still a point . grad a: is that right ? phd c: in fact we get it for free grad a: Oh . phd c: So , I can I can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order if we 're postdoc e: The other thing too is from from a grad a: Well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gonna have someone to work on it , so maybe we need to think about it a little bit . postdoc e: The other thing too is that their their jus their transcription format is really nice and simple in in the discourse domain . Maybe we should maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did phd b: Yeah , absolutely . grad a: OK , why don't you go ahead and do that then Eric ? phd b: Absolutely . postdoc e: but , phd c: Well they 're postdoc e: this is clever . phd c: Apparently this was like phase one postdoc e: Got it through the LDC . phd c: and the there 's still more that they 're gonna do apparently or something like that unless of course they have funding issues postdoc e: Great . phd c: and then then it ma they may not do phase two but from all the web documentation it looked like , \" oh , this is phase one \" , whatever that means . Yeah , that  , they 're really well respected in the linguistics d side too and the discourse area , phd c: OK . phd c: But , it  it would also maybe help be helpful for Liz , if she wanted to start working on some discourse issues , you know , looking at some of this data and then , grad a: Right . grad a: Actually , that 's another thing I was thinking about is that maybe Jane should talk to Liz , to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked . undergrad d: That would be a meeting meeting meeting ? grad a: A meeting meeting meeting . But maybe we should ,  find some day that Liz  , Liz and Andreas seem to be around more often . phd c: So maybe we should find a day when they 're gonna be here and and Morgan 's gonna be here , and we can meet , at least this subgroup . grad a: Well , I was even thinking that maybe we need to at least ping the U - dub to see phd c: We need we need to talk to them some more . grad a: you know , say \" this is what we 're thinking about for our transcription \" , if nothing else . So , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ? phd b:   What we 're using right now is a tool , from this French group , called \" Transcriber \" that seems to work very well .  , so it has a , nice useful Tcl - TK user interface and , undergrad d: Thi - this is the process of converting audio to text ? grad a: Right . So all all so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time , and then write down what was said within it , and identify the speaker . And so the things we that we know that I know I want are the text , the start and end , and the speaker .  , and then things like repairs , and false starts , and , filled pauses , and all that other sort of stuff , we have to decide how much of that we wanna do . My my view on it was when you have a repair then ,  it seems  , we saw , there was this presentation in the one of the speech group meetings about how grad a:   postdoc e: and I think Liz has done some stuff too on that , that it ,  that you get it bracketed in terms of like well , if it 's parenthetical , which I know that Liz has worked on , then  y y you 'll have different prosodic aspects . postdoc e: And then also if it 's a r if it 's a repair where they 're like what I just did , then it 's nice to have sort of a sense of the continuity of the utterance , the start to be to the finish . And , it 's a little bit deceptive if you include the repai the pre - repair part and sometimes or of it 's in the middle . Anyway , so what I was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs which isn't  , very time - consuming . undergrad d: I is there already some sort of plan in place for how this gonna be staffed or done ? Or is it real is that what we 're talking about here ? grad a: Well , that 's part of the thing we 're talking about . So what we wanted to do was have Jane do basically one meeting 's worth , you know , forty minutes to an hour , postdoc e:   undergrad d: It this is this is like five times real time or ten times real time postdoc e: Yeah , as a pilot study . grad a: Ten times about , is and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take , and then also what tools we would use . And so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we gonna do it ? So . undergrad d: And so you make Jane do the first one so then she can decide , oh , we don't need all this stuff , just the words are fine . postdoc e: I wanna hear about these  , we have a g you were s continuing with the transcription conventions for s grad a: R right , so so one one option is to get linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it .  , it will require a post pass ,  people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it 's been done correctly , but I just can't imagine that we 're gonna get anything that much better from a commercial one . undergrad d: Can't we get Joy to do it all ? grad a: Yeah right . postdoc e: No , that 's grad a: We will just get Joy and Jane to do everything . undergrad d: Is tha wasn't that what she was doing before ? Yeah , that 's right . grad a: But , you know , that 's what we 're talking about is getting some slaves who who need money undergrad d: Right . grad a: and , duh , again o postdoc e: I object to that characterization ! phd b: Oh , really . And so again , I have to say \" are we recording \" postdoc e: Oh , thank you . grad a: and then say , Morgan has has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have . Right ? undergrad d: Well , we already we already We already have a plan in place for the first meeting . undergrad d: Right ? That 's postdoc e: Well th there is als Yeah , really . There is also the o other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks , you can you could get people to to  , to do it in exchange . undergrad d: Well , i b but seriously , I  , Morgan 's obviously in a bind over this and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory , which is we we go ahead as though there will be money at the time that we need the money . grad a: So at any rate , Jane was looking into the possibility of getting students , at is that right ? Talking to people about that ? postdoc e: I 'm afraid I haven't made any progress in that front yet . So ,  undergrad d: I d do So until you actually have a little experience with what this this French thing does we don't even have postdoc e: And I do have grad a: She 's already done quite a bit . So that 's where you came up with the f the ten X number ? postdoc e: yeah . undergrad d: Or is that really just a guess ? postdoc e: Actually that 's the the one people usually use , ten X . phd c: How fast are you ? postdoc e: And I haven't really calculated How fast am I ? undergrad d: Yeah i postdoc e: I haven't done a s see , I 've been at the same time doing kind of a boot strapping in deciding on the transcription conventions that that are you know , and and stuff like , you know , how much phd b: Mmm . postdoc e: There 's some interesting human factors problems like , yeah , what span of of time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to  , transcribe it the most quickly . postdoc e: Cuz then , you know , you get like if you get a span of five words , that 's easy . And then there 's the issue of it 's easier to hear it th right the first time if you 've marked it at a boundary instead of somewhere in the middle , phd b:   postdoc e: cuz then the word 's bisected or whatever and And so  , I 've been sort of playing with , different ways of mar cuz I 'm thinking , you know , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take . undergrad d: D does  this tool you 're using is strictly it doesn't do any speech recognition does it ? grad a: No . undergrad d: But but is there anyway to to wire a speech recognizer up to it and actually run it through postdoc e: That 's an interesting idea . grad a: We 've we 've thought about doing that postdoc e: Hey ! grad a: but the recognition quality is gonna be horrendous . undergrad d: First of all the time marking you 'd get you could get by a tool . undergrad d: And so if the if if the issue really postdoc e: That 's interesting . undergrad d: I 'm think about the close caption that you see running by on on live news casts . And in a lot of them you see typos and things like that , grad a:   undergrad d: but it but it occurs to me that it may be a lot easier to correct things than it is to do things from scratch , no matter how wonderful the tool is . Yeah , we undergrad d: But if if there was a way to merge the two phd c: Well , but sometimes it 's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right grad a: we 've talked about it postdoc e: That 'd be fun . grad a: but phd c: it depends on the error rate , right ? undergrad d: Well s but but again the timing is for fr should be for free . grad a: We don't care about the timing of the words , just of the utterances . postdoc e: No ,  the the boundary phd c: We cut it s s phd b: We don't we don't know , actually . phd b: We haven't decided which which time we care about , and that 's kind of one of the things that you 're saying , is like you have the option to put in more or less timing data and , be in the absence of more specific instructions , we 're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is . grad a: Yeah , so so what what she 's done so far , is sort of more or less breath g not breath groups , sort of phrases , continuous phrases . grad a: And so , that 's nice because you you separate when you do an extract , you get a little silence on either end . postdoc e: Although I was I you know , the alternative , which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time , recently was ,  that , you know , ev if it were like an arbitrary segment of time i t pre - marked cuz it does take time to put those markings in . postdoc e: It 's really the i the interface is wonderful because , you know , the time it takes is you listen to it , and then you press the return key . But then , you know , it 's like , you press the tab key to stop the flow and and , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary . But , you know , obviously there 's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: so it 's slightly delayed , so then you you listen to it a second time and move it over to here . undergrad d: i a postdoc e: Now if it could all be pre - marked at some , l you know , good undergrad d: ar but grad a:  . undergrad d: Are are those d delays adjustable ? Those delays adjustable ? See a lot of people who actually build stuff with human computer interfaces understand that delay , phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: and and so when you by the time you click it it 'll be right on because it 'll go back in time to put the postdoc e: Yeah . postdoc e: It has other grad a: couldn't we Dan ? Yeah , mis Mister TCL ? phd b: Yeah . grad a: But ,  postdoc e: it 's not bad grad a: But , if we tried to do automatic speaker ID . phd b: Yeah , yeah , but grad a: But that would be phd b: But we 've got we 've got the most channel data . postdoc e: Oh , good point ! Ah ! grad a: Yeah , I guess the question is how much time will it really save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it . but the chances are if we if we 're talking about collecting ten or a hundred hours , which is going to take a hundred or a thousand hours to transcribe undergrad d: If grad a: But undergrad d: if we can go from ten X to five X we 're doing a big grad a: We 're gonna need we 're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools , and validate the tools the do the d to to do all this anyway . phd b: If we 're just doing silence detection postdoc e: But but it op grad a: I knew you were gonna do that .  , it it 's it 's maybe like a week 's work to get to do something like this . postdoc e: Could you get it so that with so it would it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker ? And the the format 's really transparent . postdoc e: It 's just a matter of a very c clear it 's XML , isn't it ? grad a:   postdoc e: It 's very  , I looked at the the file format and it 's just it has a t a time a time indication and then something or other , and then an end time or something or other . phd c: and undergrad d: Is this already in the past or already in the future ? phd c: Already in the past . undergrad d: You 've already you 've already done some ? grad a: She 's she 's done about half a meeting . phd c: She she 's done one she 's one postdoc e: Yes I have . grad a: About half ? phd c: I 'm go postdoc e: S I 'm not sure if it 's that 's much but anyway , enough to work with . And then go through  , and go through and and try and re - transcribe it , given that we had perfect boundary detection . undergrad d: And forgetting all the words because you 've been thr postdoc e: Yeah , that 's what I was thinking . phd c: Yeah , that 's part of the problem is , is that what we really need is somebody else to come along . phd b: Well , no , you should do it you should do it Do it again from scratch and then do it again at the boundaries . undergrad d: And so you 'll get you 'll get down to one point two X by the time you get done . undergrad d: No , but the thing is the fact that she 's she 's did it before just might give a lower bound . undergrad d: It 's And if the lower bound is nine X then w it 's a waste of time . postdoc e: Well ,  but there 's an extra problem which is that I didn't really keep accurate phd b: Oh ! postdoc e: it wasn't a pure task the first time , phd b: Yeah . So I think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a new a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting . phd b: The point we where do we get the the the oracle boundaries from ? phd c: Right . grad a: Yeah , one person would have to assign the boundaries and the and the other person would have to postdoc e: Well , but couldn't I do it for the next phd b: We we we could get fake grad a:  that 's easy enough . postdoc e: Well , but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a partic specific channel wouldn't they ? grad a: No , no . You wanna know given Given a perfect human segmentation , you wanna know how well postdoc e: Yeah . phd c: the the question is , is it worth giving you the segmentation ? postdoc e: Oh , I see what you mean . grad a: I could generate the segmentation and and you could do the words , and time yourself on it . grad a: That would at least tell us whether it 's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool , that will compute the segmentations . undergrad d: And the thing to keep in mind too about this tool , guys is that sure , you can do the computation for what we 're gonna do in the future but if if UW 's talking about doing two , or three , or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool , then obviously there 's a real multiplier there . postdoc e: And the other thing too is with with speaker identification , if if that could handle speaker identification that 's a big deal . postdoc e: That 's a major that 's like , one of the two things that phd c: there 's gonna there 's gonna be in the meeting , like the reading group meeting that we had the other day , that 's it 's gonna be a bit of a problem phd b: OK . grad a: That undergrad d: But you didn't say anything worth while anyway , right ? grad a: That 'll s phd b: Right . phd b: So I I need to we need to look at what what the final output is but it seems like we it doesn't it seems like it 's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate the phrase marks , and the speaker , and speaker identity without putting in the words . I 've already become pretty familiar with the format , postdoc e: That 'd be so great . grad a: If you 'd tell me where it is , huh ? postdoc e: We didn't finish the the part of work already completed on this , did we ?  , you you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions , grad a:   postdoc e: and , I guess you 've mentioned in your progress report , or status report , that you had written a script to convert it into So , I when I i the it 's quickest for me in terms of the transcription part to say something like , you know , if if Adam spoke to ,  to just say , \" A colon \" , Like who could be , you know ,  at the beginning of the line . postdoc e: and E colon instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing , indicating the speaker ID . So , and then he has a script that will convert it into the the thing that , would indicate speaker ID .  , I looked at Cyber Transcriber postdoc e: Yeah , well that 's true , but grad a: which is a service that you send an audio file , they do a first - pass speech recognition . postdoc e: What i just approximately , what did you find out in terms of price or or whatever ? grad a: Well , for Cyber Transcriber they don't quote a price . postdoc e: Or of action ? grad a: For thirty dollars an hour for of their work . Oh , of their grad a: So so if it 's ten times it 's three hundred dollars an hour . postdoc e: Oh ! phd c: So that 's three that 's three hours . undergrad d: D did you talk to anybody that does closed captioning for for  , TV ? phd c: Right . undergrad d: Cuz they a usually at the end of the show they 'll tell what the name of the company is , the captioning company that 's doing it . undergrad d: Well , you know , the the thing the thing about this is thinking kind of , maybe a little more globally than I should here but that really this could be a big contribution we could make .  , we 've been through the STP thing , we know what it what it 's like to to manage the manage the process , and admittedly they might have been looking for more detail than what we 're looking for here but it was a it was a big hassle , right ? phd b: Yeah . And it 's it 's only our time , where \" our \" of course includes Dan , Dan and you guys . j Just seems like phd b: Yeah ,  I don't know if we 'd be able to do any thing f to help STP type problems . But certainly for this problem we can do a lot better than undergrad d: Bec Why ? Because they wanted a lot more detail ? grad a: Right . Because they had because they only had two speakers , right ?  , the the segmentation problem is grad a: Trivial . So what took them so long ? grad a: mostly because they were doing much lower level time . grad a: And so we 're w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that . But there 's still the same issue of managing the process , of of reviewing and keeping the files straight , and all this stuff , that which is clearly a hassle . And so so what I 'm saying is that if we hire an external service I think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour . phd c: And who who knows if they 're gonna be able to m manage multal multiple channel data ? phd b: Yeah , they won't . phd b: No , but  , they they they won't they won't they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material . postdoc e: And then there 's the problem also that phd b: That 's not what they 're d quoting for , right ? grad a: Yes , it is . undergrad d: Well , they might they might quote it phd b: For quoting meetings ? grad a: Sev - several of them say that they 'll do meetings , and conferences , and s and so on . undergrad d: Th - th the th there may be just multiplier for five people costs twice as much and for ten people co Something like that . So what they had is , if it 's an easy task it costs twenty - four dollars an hour and it will take maybe five or six times real time . And what they said is for the hardest tasks , bad acoustics , meeting settings , it 's thirty - two dollars an hour and it takes about ten times real time . undergrad d: A lot of companies I 've worked for y the ,  the person leading the meeting , the executive or whatever , would sort of go around the room and and mentally calculate h how many dollars per hour this meeting was costing , grad a: So . But you know , it 's a lot like , \" he 's worth fifty an hour , he 's worth \" And so he so here we 're thinking , \" well let 's see , if the meeting goes another hour it 's going to be another thousand dollars . \" You know ? It 's grad a: Yep , we have to have a short meeting . But at any rate , so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out . undergrad d: And we 're talking about do doing how many hours worth of meetings ? grad a: Thirty or forty . phd c: So it 's thirty dollars an hour , essentially , right ? undergrad d: Yeah . And the question is what 's the difference phd b: How how much lower are they ? phd c: or ei eight dollars . What do you know what the going rate is ? It 's it 's on the order of eight to ten . postdoc e: yeah , I was gonna say eight you 'd say ten ? phd c: Let 's say ten . undergrad d: The - these are not for engineering graduate students , right ? grad a: Right , these are linguistics grad students . phd c: Yeah , I I I don't I don't know what the I don't know what the standard undergrad d: That 's right . phd c: so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it 's cheaper to to do graduate students . grad a: that 's why I said originally , that I couldn't imagine sending it out 's gonna be cheaper . postdoc e: The other thing too is that , if they were linguistics they 'd be you know , in terms of like the post editing , i  tu  content wise they might be easier to handle cuz they might get it more right the first time . grad a: we can't tell them , you know , \" for this meeting we really wanna mark stress postdoc e: Good point . grad a: And and they 're not gonna provide they 're not gonna provide stress , they 're not gonna re provide repairs , they 're not gonna provide they they may or may not provide speaker ID . undergrad d: Just hypoth hypothetically assuming that that we go ahead and ended up using graduate students . I who who 's the person in charge ? Who 's gonna be the Steve here ? grad a: I hope it 's Jane . undergrad d: You ? grad a: Is that alright ? postdoc e: Oh , interesting .  , now would this involve some manner of  , monetary compensation or would I be the voluntary , coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking ? grad a: I would imagine there would be some monetary involved but we 'd have to talk to Morgan about it . See ? postdoc e: Oh , undergrad d: That 's why Dave should have been here . grad a: Well , I would like you to do it because you have a lot more experience than I do , postdoc e: Oh , cool . grad a: but if if that 's not feasible , I will do it with you as an advisor . undergrad d: W we 'd like you to do it and we 'd like to pay you . phd c: That 's a undergrad d: And and then postdoc e: OK . undergrad d: an an an and be and be sure and say , would you like fries with that when you 're thinking about your pay scale . Yeah , no , that I I would be interested in that in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that grad a: OK . grad a: any more on transcript we wanna talk about ? phd b: What s so what are you so you 've done some portion of the first meeting . phd b: To carry on doing it ? postdoc e: What Well , you know what I thought was right now we have p So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions . And so my next plan would be phd b: What what do they what do they cover ? postdoc e: They 're very minimal . postdoc e: and this is a way which meshes well with with , making it so that , you know , on the At the phd b: Yeah . When you when you get the ,  you you get the speech signal you also get down beneath it , an indication of , if you have two speakers overlapping in a s in a single segment , you see them one displayed one above each other . And then at the same time the top s part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing . You can clip click on individual utterances and it 'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal , and play it for you . undergrad d: Is there a limit to the number of speakers ? grad a: the user interface only allows two . And so , using this the convention that Jane and I have discussed , you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want . undergrad d: Th - this is the French software , right ? grad a: Yeah , French . phd b: Oh , really ? undergrad d: did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers ? postdoc e: Oh . grad a: Yes , and they said that 's on in in the works for the next version . grad a: Multichannels was also Well , they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channels . undergrad d: Do - do you know what they 're using it for ? Why 'd they develop it ? grad a: For this exact task ? phd c: For transcription . undergrad d: Are they linguists ? phd c: It 's undergrad d: But  , are they are they linguists or are they speech recognition people ? grad a: I think they 're linguists . phd c: They 're they have some connection to the LDC cuz the LDC has been advising them on this process , the Linguistic Data Consortium . grad a: And they have they 've actually asked if we are willing to do any development and I said , well , maybe . grad a: So if we want if we did if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually I think is a great idea , I 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in . You know , they they do have So you have when you when you play it back , it 's it is useful to have , a a break mark to se segment it . But it wouldn't be strictly necessary cuz you can use the  , the tabbed key to toggle the sound on and off . And then also once you 've put a break in then you have the option of cycling through the unit . undergrad d: Loop it ? Yo - you n you know , there 's al also the the user interface that 's missing . postdoc e: Or or or undergrad d: It 's missing from all of our offices , and that is some sort of analog input for something like this . It 's something that wh when you move your hand further , the sound goes faster past it , like fast forward . You know , like a joy stick or a  , you could wire a mouse or trackball to do something like that . postdoc e: Why , that 's That 's not something I wanted to have happen . undergrad d: No , but I 'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for for for m for video or for audio where you you need to do this , postdoc e: I see . undergrad d: and so you get very good at sort of jostling back and forth , rather than hitting tab , and backspace , and carriage return , and enter , and things like that . grad a: Yeah , we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog phd c: Yeah . grad a: So  , tho those are things we could do but I I just don't know how much it 's worth doing . postdoc e: They thought about and also it 'll go around the c the , I wanna say cursor but I 'm not sure if that 's the right thing . postdoc e: Anyway , you can so they thought about different ways of having windows that you c  work within , phd b:   postdoc e: and But so in terms of the con the conventions , then , basically , it 's strictly orthographic which means with some w provisions for , w  , colloquial forms . So if a person said , \" cuz \" instead of \" because \" then I put a an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in in double ang angle brackets what the full lexical item would be . postdoc e: And this could be something that was handled by a table or something but I think to have a convention marking it as a non - standard or wha I don't mean standard but a a a non  , ortho orthographic , whatever . And and there would be limits to how much refinement you want in indicating something as non - standard pres pronunciation . phd c: How are you handling backchannels ? postdoc e: Backchannels ? grad a: Comments . postdoc e: you know oh , yes , there was some in my view , when i when you 've got it densely overlapping , I didn't worry about I didn't worry about s specific start times . phd c: What do you mean by du postdoc e: I sort of thought that this is not gonna be easily processed anyway and maybe I shouldn't spend too much time getting exactly when the person said \" no \" , or , you know , i \" immediate \" . postdoc e: And instead just sort of rendered \" within this time slot , there were two people speaking during part of it phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: and if you want more detail , figure it out for yourself \" , phd b:   grad a: Well , I think what w what Eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech , phd c: I see . postdoc e: was sort of the way I felt @ @ grad a: right ? phd c: Well , yeah , what  is wh  , when somebody says \"  - huh \" in the middle of , a @ @ grad a: Yep . phd c: Oh , cuz I was I was listening to Dan was agreeing a lot to things that you were saying as you were talking . Well , if it if there was a word like \" right \" , you know , then I wou I would indicate that it happened within the same tem time frame grad a: Yeah , there 's an overlapping mark . grad a: when when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , and we 're all sort of separated , and and doing things . But even during the meeting there 's a lot of overlap but it it 's marked pretty clearly .  , some of the backchannel stuff Jane had some comments and but I think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting . grad a: Yeah , but someone who , was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that . grad a: Or when Dan said , \" I wa I wasn't talking to you \" . undergrad d: So you take a bathroom break in the middle and and keep your head mount grad a: You have to turn off your mike . postdoc e: Well he was so so he was checking the meter levels and and we were handling things while he was labeling the the whatever it was , the PDA ? grad a:   postdoc e:  And and so he was in sort of you were sort of talking you know , so I was saying , like \" and I could label this one left . grad a: But postdoc e: But really , no ,  w you know in the context if you know he can't hear what he 's saying grad a: but when you w when you listen to it undergrad d: he he It was a lot funnier if you were there though . postdoc e: yeah , grad a: Well what what it what happens is if you 're a transcriber listening to it it sounds like Dan is just being a total totally impolite . grad a:  But but if you knew that that I wasn't actually in the room , and that Dan wasn't talking to me , it it became OK . undergrad d: So th postdoc e: And that 's w that 's where I added comments . postdoc e: The rest of the time I didn't bother with who was talking to who but but this was unusual circum circumstance . undergrad d: So this is this is gonna go on the meeting meeting transcriber bloopers tape , right ? grad a: Yes . postdoc e: Well and part of it was funny ,  reason was because it was a mixed signal so you couldn't get any clues from volume that , you know , he was really far away from this conversation . I should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other . I have a auto - gain - mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal postdoc e: That 's a good idea . postdoc e: But I thought it would be you know , I I didn't wanna add more contextual comments than were needed but that , it seemed to me , clarified that the con what was going on . And ,  OK , phd c: So , s postdoc e: so normalization phd c: I was just gonna ask , so I just wanted to c sort of finish off the question I had about backchannels , phd b: Mmm . phd c: which which was , so say somebody 's talking for a while postdoc e: Yeah . phd c: and somebody goes \"  -  \" in the middle of it , and and and what not , does the conversation come out from the or the person who 's speaking for the long time as one segment and then there 's this little tiny segment of this other speaker or does it does the fact that there 's a backchannel split the the the it in two . postdoc e: OK , my my focus was to try and maintain conten con content continuity and , to keep it within what he was saying . Like I wouldn't say breath groups but prosodic or intonational groups as much as possible . So if someone said \"  -  \" in the middle of a of someone 's , intonational contour , I I indicated it as , like what you just did . postdoc e: then I indicated it as a segment which contained @ @ this utterance plus an overlap . phd b: But that 's but there 's only one there 's only one time boundary for both speakers , phd c: OK . And you know , it could be made more precise than that phd c: I see , postdoc e: but I just thought phd c: I see , OK . undergrad d: I think whenever we use these speech words we should always do the thing like you 're talking about , accent , postdoc e: Oh , I see what you mean . OK , and so then , in terms of like words like \"  \" and \"  \" I just wrote them because I figured there 's a limited number , and I keep them to a  , limited set because it didn't matter if it was \" mmm \" or \"  \" , you know , versus \"  \" . It 'd be good to have that in the in the conventions , what 's to be used . grad a: I I did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end . undergrad d: Well , what 's that mean ? postdoc e: Yeah , OK . phd b: We have to mark those ? postdoc e: So I had phd b: Don't they d can't we just leave them unmarked ? postdoc e: I d Well , you see , that 's possible too . grad a: Well , I wanna leave the marked I don't want them to be part of another utterance . Now that 's refinement that , maybe it could be handled by part of the part of the script or something more phd b: yeah , it seems like it seems like the , tran the transcription problem would be very different if we had these automatic speaker detection turn placing things . Because suddenly  , I don't know , actually it sounds like there might be a problem putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels . Well you were saying , I think it can read grad a: It can read and write as many as you want , it 's just that it postdoc e:  - huh . phd b: But what if you wanna edit it ? Right ?  , the point is we 're gonna generate this transcript with five five tracks in it , but with no words .  , and if there are five five people speaking at once , grad a: Right , i it 's I didn't explain it well . If we use the the little the conventions that Jane has established , I have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention . postdoc e: And it can be m edited after the fact , grad a: Yes . postdoc e: can't it also ? But their but their format , if you wanted to in indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route , then i they a c window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers . undergrad d: But you 're saying that by the time you call it back in to from their saved format it opens up a window with window with five speakers ? postdoc e: So . undergrad d: Oh ! That is sort of f grad a: It 's just user interface . undergrad d: They didn't quite go the whole grad a: So i it 's undergrad d: Yeah , they didn't go the whole route , grad a: the the the whole saved form the saved format and the internal format , all that stuff , handles multiple speakers . undergrad d: did they ? They just grad a: It 's just there 's no user interface for specifying multiple any more than two . So your your script solves Doesn't it solve all our problems , postdoc e: And that grad a: Yep . undergrad d: cuz we 're always gonna wanna go through this preprocessing grad a: Yep . Oh , yes , I I wanted to have So sometimes a pers I  in terms of like the continuity of thought for transcriptions , it 's i it isn't just words coming out , it 's like there 's some purpose for an utterance . And sometimes someone will do a backchannel in the middle of it but you wanna show that it 's continued at a later point . So I have I have a convention of putting like a dash arrow just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues . And then when it  , catches back up again then there 's an arrow dash , and then you have the opposite direction to indicate continuation of ones own utterance versus , sometimes we had the situation which is you know , which you which you get in conversations , of someone continuing someone else 's utterance , phd b: Mmm . postdoc e: and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde , to indicate that it was continuation but it wasn't Oh , I guess I did equal arrow for the for the own for yourself things phd b:   postdoc e: And then you could track whether it was the same speaker or not by knowing you know , at the end of this unit you 'd know what happened later . grad a: So phd b: But the only time that becomes ambiguous is if you have two speakers . Like , if you If you only have one person , if you only have one thought that 's continuing across a particular time boundary , you just need one arrow at each end , and if it 's picked up by a different speaker , it 's picked up by a different speaker . I guess if you have more than one thread going , then you then you need to know whether they were swapped or not . You know , undergrad d: It l ou grad a: if you were trying to do a remembrance agent . grad a: But , a lot of these issues , I think that for  , from my point of view , where I just wanna do speech recognition and information retrieval , it doesn't really matter . I you know I did this I did this transcription and I marked that , I marked it with ellipsis because it seemed like there was a difference . It 's something you wanted to indicate that it that I this was the end of the phrase , this was the end of that particular transcript , but it was continued later . Well that 's you know ,  I that 's why I didn't I didn't do it n  , that 's why I thought about it , and and re - ev phd b: Yeah , yeah . postdoc e: and it didn't do I didn't do it in ten times the the time . grad a: Well , so anyway , are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically ? postdoc e: Yeah . postdoc e: I also wanted to ask you if you have a time estimate on the part that you transcribed . Do you have a sense of how long phd b: Yeah , it took me half an hour to transcribe a minute , but I didn't have any I didn't even have a postdoc e: OK . So I was doing it by typ typing into a text file and trying to fit It was horrible . postdoc e: Well , that 's that 's because you didn't have the segmentation help and all the other grad a: But I think for a first try that 's about right . phd b: Is it phd c: So so if we hired a who if we hired a whole bunch of Dan 's undergrad d: That 's right . phd b: It was actually it was quite it was a t undergrad d: a grad a: If we hire an infinite number of Dan 's phd b: it w undergrad d: It 'd b a a postdoc e: And there 's always a warm up thing of grad a: Are we gonna run out of disk space by the way ? phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: d Doesn't it beep in the other room when you 're out of disk space ? phd c: So Is there grad a: No . phd c: Maybe we should s consider also , starting to build up a web site around all of these things . phd b: We could have like business - to - business E - commerce as well ! phd c: That 's right . No , but I 'm it would be interesting it would be interesting to see grad a: Can we sell banner ads ? undergrad d: Get get paid for click - throughs ? grad a: What a good idea , phd b: Yeah . phd c: I want to introduce I I want to introduce the word \" snot - head \" into the conversation at this point . phd b: We can have undergrad d: You wanna word that won't be recognized ? phd c: You see , cuz  , cuz Exactly . Alright , see here 's here 's here 's my thought behind it which is that , the the stuff that you 've been describing , Jane , I gu one has to , of course indicate , i is very interesting , postdoc e: Alright . phd c: and I I 'd like to be able to to pore through , you know , the the types of tr conventions that you 've come up with and stuff like that . postdoc e: OK , now , w the alternative to a web site would be to put it in Doctor speech . postdoc e: Cuz cuz what I have is a soft link to my transcription that I have on my account phd c: Either 's fine . undergrad d: Web site 's what ? phd b: We could actually maybe we could use the TCL plug - in . See he said the word TCL and and that 's undergrad d: But he does such a good job of it . But I should be allowed to but undergrad d: If you just did a crappy job , no nobody would want you to do it . phd b: I sh I shouldn't be allowed to by m by my own by my according to my own priorities . grad a: And we have we have quite a disparate number of web and other sorts of documents on this project sort of spread around . grad a: and phd c: Right , so we can add in links and stuff like that to other things . phd c: The phd b: Well so then th grad a: Try try to s consolidate . phd c: Well , we could put we could put sort of a disorganized sort of group gestalt undergrad d: Why ? What what 's what 's the issue ? phd b: No one owns the project . undergrad d: W well Do But grad a: It 's mine ! All mine ! phd b: Well then you have to do the web site . undergrad d: But grad a: \" Wah - hah - hah - hah - hah - hah . undergrad d: b but but but what are you what are you talking about for web site hacking ? phd b: No undergrad d: You 're talking about writing HTML , right ? grad a: Yeah , I I 'm talking about putting together all the data in a form that that is legible , and pleasant to read , and up to date , and et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . undergrad d: But , is it against the law to actually use a tool to help your job go easier ? grad a: Absolutely . undergrad d: You y grad a: It 's just as easy to use to edit the raw HTML as anything else . undergrad d: No kidding ? phd b: That 's obviously not true , grad a: It 's obviously not true . phd b: but you have undergrad d: No , it it it 's obviously true that he hasn't found any he likes . postdoc e: Which one do you use Jim ? undergrad d: I use something called Trellix . grad a: Now , I guess if I were if I were doing more powerful excuse me more complex web sites I might want to . postdoc e: Well , would this be to document it also for outside people or mainly for in house use ? grad a: But . phd b: I I I I grad a: OK , well , send me links and I wi send me pointers , rather , and I 'll put it together . I don't think we should say , \" oh , it 's internal therefore we don't have to make it very good \" . phd b: therefore we can put data in it that we don't we don't have to worry about releasing \" . postdoc e: Yeah , it is true , that is it benefits to undergrad d: Cuz you 're gonna have to wor do the work sooner or later . undergrad d: d we we out of tape out of disk ? phd b: No , we 're doing we 're doing great . undergrad d: I I was looking for the actual box I plan to use , but I c all I could I couldn't find it at the local store . And it 's two by two , by one , and it would fit right under the right under th the the the the lip , grad a: Yeah , does everyone know about the lip on the table ? It 's great . undergrad d: And , it oc I p especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded . grad a: Clink ! Clink ! undergrad d: Let 's see see what it does to the But this was the  just just to review , and I also brought this along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of w push them around . grad a: And and crinkle them and phd b: What ? postdoc e: And th \" that \" being a diagram . phd b: What ? undergrad d: That that 's the six tables that we 're looking at . phd b:  th undergrad d: Well why not ?  , cuz this is what 's gonna happen . And and and you So this is the box 's grad a: Get your paper off my PDA ! phd b: Yeah . And so the the two head set jacks would be in the front and then the little LED to indicate that that box is live . The the important issue about the LED is the fact that we 're talking about eight of these total , which would be sixteen channels . And , even though we have sixteen channels back at the capture , they 're not all gonna be used for this . undergrad d: So there 'd be a subset of them used for obviously j just use the ones at this end for for this many . you 'd like a a way to tell whether your box is live , so the LED wouldn't be on . undergrad d: So if you 're plugged in it doesn't work and the LED is off that 's that 's a tip off . And then the ,  would wire the all of the cables in a in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these cables at the same time . undergrad d: so this this notion of putting down the P Z Ms and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table grad a: Right . undergrad d: and even though there 's eight cables they 're not really very big around so my model is to get a a a p piece of grad a: Sleeve . undergrad d: yeah , that that stuff that people put with the little you slip the wires into that 's sort of shaped like that cross section . I 'm I 'm r a I 'm going up and then I 'm going down . grad a: Whoo ! phd b: Speed bump ! postdoc e: Sleeping pol phd b: Speed bump . grad a: Speed A \" sleeping policeman \" ! undergrad d: Yeah , it 's like a speed bum An postdoc e: Speed bump . undergrad d: And they 're ac they 're actually ext extruded from plastic . phd c: What does that mean ? phd b: That 's the s that 's British for speed bump , phd c: Is it a speed bump ? undergrad d: So that the wires go through here . postdoc e: Ah ! grad a: OK , so that undergrad d: s So it would c basically go on the diagonal here . grad a: So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ? phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: because the phd b: How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ? undergrad d: Because they 're there . Why two each ? phd b: Oh , because then you don't have to just have one each . So that if t if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box . undergrad d: And to See , thi this is really the way people sit on this table . phd b: Only if you had Well it depends on this box , right ? undergrad d: Oh , true enough . grad a: Oh , I didn't understand undergrad d: This this box Thi - thi thi this box is a one off deal . And , it 's function is to s to , essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires , plus supply power to the microphones cuz the the he the , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage . grad a: So so you 'd imagine some sort of in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ? phd b:  ! undergrad d: Well I w I I the simplest thing I could imagine , i which is really , really simple is to quite literally that these things plug in . And there 's a there 's a plug on the end of each of these these , ei eight cables . undergrad d: An - and there 's only there 's only four slots that are you know , in in the first version or the version we 're planning to to build . undergrad d: So that that was the whole issue with the LED , that you plug it in , the LED comes on , and and and you 're live . undergrad d: Now the the the subtle issue here is that tha I I haven't really figured out a solution for this . What happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else ? grad a:   undergrad d: Well the there 's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you 're really not being powered . So th there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people , rewire things . phd b: But  there are actually that you know , there 's an extra there 's a mix out on the radio receiver ? undergrad d:   phd b: So there are actually six XLR outs on the back of the radio receiver and only five cables going in , I had the wrong five , so I ended up not recording one of the channels and recording the mix . undergrad d: Wonder whether it works any phd b: But I subtracted the four that I did have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the @ @ . undergrad d: Is it is phd b: It 's not bad , grad a: Wow . grad a: So what 's the schedule on these things ? undergrad d: So phd b: But , you always postdoc e: Wow . undergrad d: well I was wrestling with th with literally the w number of connectors in the cable and the the , powering system . And I I was gonna do this very clever phantom power and I decided a couple days ago not to do it . So I think the other thing I 'd like to do is , do something about the set up phd b: See grad a: so that it 's a little more presentable and organized . Dan - Dan and I have sort of gone around on this , and we were thinking about something that opened up in the top to allow access to the mixer for example . undergrad d: But there 's these things sticking out of the mixer which are kind of a pain , so you end up with this thing that if if you stuck the mixer up here and the top opened , it 'd be it 'd be fine . You wouldn't necessarily Well , you s understand what I 'm grad a: Yeah , I understand . undergrad d: the the you can you can start start s sketching it out , grad a: So . undergrad d: and I can certainly build it out of oak no problem , would it you know , arb you know , arbitrarily amount of grad a: I need a desk at home too , alright ? Is that gonna be a better solution than just going out and buy one ? undergrad d: Well , the as we found out with the the thing that , Jeff bought a long time ago to hold our stereo system the stuff you buy is total crap . Works fine for holding a Kleenex , grad a: Right , Kleenex and telephones . grad a: so yeah , I g I guess it 's just a question , is that something you wanna spend your time on ? undergrad d: Oh , I I 'm paid for . phd b: Oh , yeah ! grad a: I 'm telling you , I 'm just gonna cart one of them away if they stay there much longer . undergrad d: let the record show at  at f four thirty - five Adam Janin says postdoc e: Wow . grad a: So , j  , then the other question is do we wanna try to do a user interface that 's available out here ? phd b: Sorry ? undergrad d: Slipped almost slipped it by Dan . grad a: And how do we want to do that ? postdoc e: You mean like see see meter readings , from while sitting here . undergrad d: What 's wrong with yours ? If we bought you a a phd b: Oh , a Applecard . phd c: Well undergrad d: What ? grad a: I have an IRAM machine I 've borrowed and we can use it . phd b: I or the undergrad d: N no , I 'm I 'm I 'm serious . Does does the wireless thing work on your grad a: Wait , isn't that an ethernet connection or is that a phone ? phd b: that 's an ethernet connection . grad a: We jus undergrad d: I 'm serious , that that it it phd b: Yeah . T to have it  , just undergrad d: It 's very convenient especially if Dan happens to be sitting at that end of the table to not have to run down here and and look in the thing every so often , phd b: Yeah . And given given that we 've got a wireless that we 've got a we got the field . undergrad d: Y  , we need obviously need to clear this with ACIRI but , how tough can that be ? There it you 'd all you need 's web access , isn't it ? phd b: W we don't need X access undergrad d: In in theory . That 's that 's what it does , undergrad d: OK , phd b: yeah . grad a: phd b: So grad a: right , so it 's just a question of getting a laptop and a wireless modem . phd b: With a with a with a w undergrad d: No , and he he had , reque @ @ my my proposal is you have a laptop . undergrad d: If if we bought you the thing would you mind using it with i the the phd b: No , I would love to but I 'm not sure if my laptop is compatible with the wave LAN thing they 're using . phd b: Well Apple has their own thing , right ? phd c: He 's undergrad d: Your new one ? grad a: Airport . phd b: Yeah , I think what I think you I think it just plug plugs in a PC card , so you could probably make it run with that , but . grad a: The question is , is there an Apple driver ? undergrad d: I e phd b: Yeah , I 'm sure . But  anyway there are there are abs there are a bunch of machines at ICSI that have those cards undergrad d: But the two t phd b: and so I think if w if it doesn't we should be able to find a machine that does that . I  I know that doesn't don't don't the important people have those little blue VAIOs that undergrad d: Well , b that to me that 's a whole nother . undergrad d: The the idea of con convincing them that we should use their network i is fairly straight forward . undergrad d: The idea of being able to walk into their office and say , \" oh , can I borrow your machine for a while \" , is is is a non - starter . So , either either we figure out how to use a machine somebody already in the group already owns , a a and the idea is that if it 's it perk , you know , it 's an advantage not not a disadvan or else we we literally buy a machine e exactly for that purpose . undergrad d: Certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time . undergrad d: I I I I 'm I 'm not a big fan of doing things to the room that make the room less attractive for other people , grad a: Right . undergrad d: right ? Which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the way grad a: Yeah . undergrad d: and and , so a monitor sitting here all the time you know people are gonna walk up to it and go , \" how come I can't get , you know , Pong on this \" or , whatev grad a:   I 've I 've borrowed the IRAM VAIO Sony thingy , phd c: Well grad a: and I don't think they 're ever gonna want it back . undergrad d: Well , the certainly , u you should give it a shot first See whether you you can get compatible stuff . Who knows , they might have an extra hardware s phd b: I 'd trade them a flat panel display for it . phd c: What is the , projector supposed to be hooked up to ? undergrad d: Good . There 's gonna be actually a a plug at the front that 'll connect to people 's laptops so you can walk in and plug it in . undergrad d: So people sitting here are going \" testing , one , two , three \" ! phd c: But  , that 's another that 's another possibility that , you know , solves undergrad d: It a phd b: Yeah . phd b: That 's an end undergrad d: But but but I think the idea of having a control panel it 's that 's there in front of you is really cool . phd b: I think and  , having having it on wireless is is the neatest way neatest way to do it . undergrad d: R grad a: I had undergrad d: As long as you d as l as long as you 're not tempted to sit there and f keep fiddling with the volume controls going , \" can you talk a bit louder ? \" phd b: Yeah . grad a: I had actually earlier asked if I could borrow one of the cards to do wireless stuff phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: And and it 's a a PCMCIA card , right ? grad a: Yep . undergrad d: right ? In your new machine ? phd c: It 's it really come down to the driver . phd c:  grad a: Right , and if and if his doesn't work , as I said , we can use the PC . undergrad d: Right , i it 'll it 'll work It 'll work the first time . phd b: grad a: So phd b: well , that sounds like a d good solution one way or the other . grad a: So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you 're gonna give some thought to cabinets ? undergrad d: y yeah .  phd b: We 'd I think undergrad d: Hey , what are those green lights doing ? grad a: They 're flashing ! phd b:  - oh !  - oh ! Does that it means it means it 's gonna explode . undergrad d: Cut the red wire , the red wire ! phd b:  grad a: When people talk , it they go on and off . phd b: using using these undergrad d: And it and the f the five thousand for the wires , so if I 'm gonna do No . phd b: that 's true undergrad d: I have to do phd b: but we haven't spent that , right ? But once we once we 've done the intellectual part of these , we can just knock them out , right ? grad a: Cheap . phd b: And then we could Washington could have a system that didn't have any wireless but would had what 's based on these undergrad d:   phd b: And that 's about cuz you wouldn't even need the mixer if you didn't have the Oh th the P Z undergrad d: Right . But anyway you 'd save , on the seven seven or eight thousand for the for the wireless system . undergrad d: What ? postdoc e: It 's nice it 's nice to be thinking toward that . grad a: There 's a speech compression program that works great on things like this , cuz if the dynamic range is low it encodes it with fewer bits . phd c: Now , shorter words wouldn't would induce more dynamics , right ? You want to have phd b: Yeah , but if the words are more predictable . postdoc e: That 's a long word ! grad a: How do you spell that ? postdoc e: I don't know . grad a: OK , can you do one more round of digits ? Are we done talking ? undergrad d: Well it 's a choice if we get a choice , let 's keep talking . grad a: Are you done ? postdoc e: I 'm done , grad a: I 'm done . Like , you know , candy bars or something , grad a: I 'll I 'll remember to bring M and M 's next time . undergrad d: or or or or or a little ,  you know , toothbrushes like they give you at the d dentist . postdoc e: We don't know that for sure , do we ? grad a: I should have mentioned that s  , to pause between lines but undergrad d: No , I know . grad a: It 's it 's only a hard time for the transcriber not for the speech recognizer . phd b: Tha - tha postdoc e: But I also think you said channel four grad a: Me . phd b: But they 're in order ! undergrad d: But real phd b: They start , six , seven , eight , nine , zero , one , two , three , four , five , six , eight , nine . undergrad d: Where 'd they come from ? phd b: And they 're in order because they 're sorted lexically by the file names , which are have the numbers in digits . phd b: And so they 're actually this is like all the all utterances that were generated by speaker MPJ or something . phd b: It doesn't matter ! It 's like Cuz you said \" six , seven , eight \" . If I if not I undergrad d: But the real question I have is that , why bother with these ? postdoc e: Oh , interesting . undergrad d: Why don't you just ask people to repeat numbers they already know ? Like phone numbers , you know , social security numbers . phd b: Cuz we have these writt written down , right ? grad a: Because Right . phd b: That 's why grad a: If we have it ,  undergrad d: I know . undergrad d: Credit card numbers , grad a: We don't have to tran undergrad d: yeah . undergrad d: Yeah , so you just say say your credit card numbers , say your phone numbers , say your mother 's maiden name . undergrad d: This grad a: Actually , this I got this directly from another training set , from Aurora . postdoc e: I was I the reason I made my mistake was grad a: What ? postdoc e: Wa - was this ? phd b: There were no there were no direct driver errors , by the look of it , which is good <doc-sep>grad b: Could I hit hit F - seven to do that ? on the Robert ? grad a: I 'm grad b: Oh , the remote will do it OK . grad b: Cuz I 'm already up there ? grad a: in control here . grad b: So , we were Ah ! grad c: Johno , where are you ? grad b: OK . grad c: Should you go back to the first one ? grad b: Do I wanna go back to the first one ? grad c: Well grad b: OK . grad d: I 'm sorry I grad c: Well , just to grad b: OK . It 's basically  talks about  It just refers to the fact that  one of main things we had to do was to decide what the intermediate sort of nodes were , grad d: I can read ! I 'm kidding . grad a: But if you really want to find out what it 's about you have to click on the little light bulb . grad b: Although I 've I 've never I don't know what the light bulb is for . grad a: Do you wanna try ? grad d: Ach u grad b: I 'd prefer not to . Is that the idea ? grad a: Why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode ? grad d: OK . grad b: Because I 'm gonna switch to the JavaBayes program grad a: Oh ! OK . grad b: You want me to Wait , what do you want me to do ? grad c: Can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side isn't doesn't appear ? grad a: No , It 's OK . grad b: Well I can do that , but then I have to end the presentation in the middle so I can go back to open up grad c: OK , fine . grad b: So then the features we decided or we decided we were talked about , right ?  the the prosody , the discourse , verb choice . Whether the and this i we actually have a separate feature but I decided to put it on the same line for space . \" Nice walls \" which we can look up because  if you 're gonna get real close to a building in the Tango mode , right , there 's gotta be a reason for it . And it 's either because you 're in route to something else or you wanna look at the walls . The context , which in this case we 've limited to \" business person \" , \" tourist \" , or \" unknown \" , the time of day , and \" open to suggestions \" , isn't actually a feature . can I just ask the nice walls part of it is that  , in this particular domain you said be i it could be on two different lines but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the that landmark - iness cor is correlated with grad b: Oh grad c: No . grad b: I either could put \" nice walls \" on its own line or \" open to suggestions \" off the slide . grad c: Like you could have a p grad d: And and By \" nice \" you mean grad c: You Like you could have a post office with  you know , nice murals or something . grad b: Or one time I was at this grad d: So \" nice walls \" is a stand in for like architecturally it ,  significant grad b: But see the thing is , if it 's grad c: Architecturally appealing from the outside . grad b: Yeah but if it 's architecturally significant you might be able to see it from Like you m might be able to \" Vista \" it , grad a:   grad b: Yeah , versus , like , I was at this place in Europe where they had little carvings of , like , dead people on the walls or something . grad b: But if you looked at it real close , you could see the the in intricacy of the of the walls . grad a: The grad d: Something you want to inspect at close range because it 's interesting . grad b: Robert ? grad a: Well there there is a term that 's often used . And I was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as \" landmark - iness \" . There 's landmark for  , touristic reasons and landmark for I don't know navigational reasons or something . Tourist - y landmarks also happen to be Wouldn't couldn't they also be They 're not exclusive groups , are they ? Like non - tourist - y landmarks and grad a: Or it can be als grad b: direct navigational grad d: They 're not mutually exclusive ? grad b: Yeah . grad b: OK , So our initial idea was not very satisfying , because  our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node . grad b: And  , so we Reasons being , you know , it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that . If we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort ,  according Bhaskara we 'd be handicapped . grad c: Well usually , you know , N If you have N features , then it 's two to the N or exponential in N . So then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ? So the thinking behind that was we have the features that we 've drawn from the communication of some Like , the someone s The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , like \" I 'm \" the the abstract idea being \" I am a tourist I want to go to this place . \" Right ? So we 're gonna set up features along the lines of where they want to go and what they 've said previously and whatnot . Right ? but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist or whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines . So then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , because we were thinking  , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to like or th grad c: Want to do Vista , grad b: Right . grad c: right ? Because if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry . grad b: Or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a like a navigational point to go to another place .  right now it 's still kind of in a toy version of it , because we didn't know the probabilities of or Well I 'll talk about it when I get the picture up . \" Verb used \" is actually personally amusing mainly because it 's it 's just whether the verb is a Tango verb , an Enter verb , or a Vista verb . grad c: Yeah , that one needs a lot of grad d: And are those mutually exclusive sets ? grad b: No . grad c: But  that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter , grad d: Got it . grad c: so we decided that for the purposes of this it 'd be simpler to just have three verbs .  Why don't you mention things about this , Bhaskara , that I am not that are not coming to my mind right now . grad c: OK , so Yeah , so note the four nodes down there , the sort of , the things that are not directly extracted . The \" closed \" is also not directly extracted I guess , from the  grad b: Well i it 's grad c:  . grad d: From the utterance ? grad b: it 's so it sort of is grad c: Actually , no , wait . grad b: because it 's because have the the time of day grad c: It is . grad c: Right , so f Right , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , that kind of thing is all  sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other things . So we haven't  , managed Like we don't have nodes for \" discourse \" and \" parse \" , although like in some sense they are parts of this belief - net . grad c: But  The idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse , grad d:   grad d: So some of the the top row of things What 's what 's \" Disc admission fee \" ? grad c: whether they discuss the admission fees . So we looked at the data and in a lot of data people were saying things like \" Can I get to this place ? \" grad d: Oh . So that 's like a huge  clue that they 're trying to Enter the place rather than  to Tango or Vista , grad d:  - huh . grad b: There were there 'd be other things besides just the admission fee , but you know , we didn't have grad d:   So there are certain cues that are very strong either lexical or topic - based  , concept cues grad b: From the discourse that Yeah . And then in that second row or whatever that row of Time of Day through that So all of those Some of them come from the utterance and some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational things . grad d: \" Unmark @ @ Time of Day \" grad c: Yeah , I m  grad a: Yeah . I would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we we all  , agree on what what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe what changes we grad b: Yeah , th OK . so one thing I I 'm you know unsure about , is how we have the discus  the \" admission fee \" thing set up . So one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this ,  we kept  things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept , but you could see perhaps discus the \" admission fee \" going directly to the mode pointing at \" Enter \" , grad a:   grad b: right ? Versus pointing to just at \" tourist \" , grad d:   grad b: But we just decided to keep all the things we extracted to point at the middle and then down . That 's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not as possible  grad b: Right . grad c: Disc - \" admission fee \" is a binary thing , \" time of day \" is like morning , afternoon , night . grad b: That 's how we have it currently set up , grad a: Yep . grad b: but it could be , you know , based upon hour grad c: Yeah . Normally context will include a huge amount of information , but  , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , I guess . grad c: So Right , grad d: Right ? grad c: so it 's not really all of context . Similarly prosody is not all of prosody but simply for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed . grad a: The the So the context is a switch between tourist or non - tourist ? grad c: and grad a: Or also unknown ? grad b: Or un unknown , grad a: OK . Unknown , right ? grad d: So final dest So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist , grad c: Which is th Which one ? grad d: but OK . so the the context being  , e I don't know if that question 's sort of in general , \" are you \"  the ar ar are do they allow business people to be doing non - business things at the moment ? grad c: Yeah , it does . So then you just have some probabilities over grad c: Everything is probablistic , and There 's always grad d: OK . \" Verb used \" is like , right now we only have three values , but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs . grad c:  \" nice walls \" is binary , \" closed \" is binary \" final destination \" , again Yeah , all those are binary I guess . grad c: Yeah , anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node . Right ? grad c: Which things ? grad a: Nice walls ? grad b: Wi grad d:   grad b: It is binary but it doesn't have question mark because it 's extracted . grad a: So we can either be in a hurry or not , but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment ? grad c: Well , we To do that we would add another  value for that . grad c: And that would require s updating the probability distribution for \" mode \" as well . grad d: So  , of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases grad a: Yeah , yeah . grad d: but you can imagine that it 's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would that would help you Like it 's a conjunction of , I don't know , you know , the verb used and some other stuff that that would determine grad c: Right . grad a: well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object right ? the argument in a sense ? grad d: Usually . I I don't know if that 's always the case I I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have . grad a: that 's always warping on something some entity , grad d:   grad a: and   maybe at this stage we will we do want to  sort of get  modifiers in there grad b:  . grad a: because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not grad b: I want to get to the church quickly , grad c: Yeah . Do we have anything else to say about this ? grad c: We can do a little demo . grad a: No , then it wouldn't be a demo I was just gonna s grad c:  We can do a demo in the sense that we can  , just ob observe the fact that this will , in fact do inference . grad c: So we can , you know , set some of the  nodes and then try to find the probability of other nodes . grad c: just  I don't know , say they discussed the admission fee grad b: OK . grad c: and  the place has nice walls grad b: I love nice walls , OK ? I 'm a big fan . grad d: it 's starting to grow on me grad b: And the time of day is night ? grad c: Yeah , no wait . grad b: One thing that bugs me about JavaBayes is you have to click that and do this . grad c: So that is the probability that they 're Entering , Vista - ing or Tango - ing . grad c: And  grad d: So slightly biased toward \" Tango \" ing grad c: Yeah . grad b: If it 's night time , they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice . The reason I say the demo doesn't work very well is yesterday we  observed everything in favor of taking a tour , and it came up as \" Tango \" , right ? Over and over again . grad c: Like , we totally hand - tuned the probabilities , grad d: Yeah . We were like \"  , well if the person does this and this and this , let 's say forty percent for this , grad d: OK . grad a: Yeah but it it grad d: Maybe the bias toward \" Tango \" ing was yours , then ? grad b: Yeah , grad c: Yeah . grad b: that 's that 's at grad c: It 's So we have to like fit the probabilities . grad d: So , the real case ? grad a: However you know , it The purpose was not really , at this stage , to come up with meaningful probabilities but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer . grad a: And grad b: We would actually I guess once we look at the data more we 'll get more hidden nodes , grad a:   grad b: No , I think we should have  exponentially more middle nodes than features we 've extracted . Whether you 're It 's whether It 's not grad d: And are th grad c: I think it 's more like \" Are you are tourist ? are you in Ham - like Heidelberg for a \" grad d: Oh , so , I thought that was directly given by the context switch . What if the context , which is not set , but still they say things like , \" I want to go  , see the  the the castle and  , et cetera . \" grad a: Is it grad b: Well the I kind of thought of \" doing business \" as more of running an errand type thing . grad a: So if you run out of cash as a tourist , and and and you need to go to the AT grad b: So i wi th grad d: OK . grad a: \" How do I get to the bank ? \" grad d: I see . grad c: And that 'll affect whether you want to enter or you if you kinda thing . grad c: Yeah , I think this context node is a bit of a I don't know , like in d  Do we wanna have Like it 's grad d: Are you assuming that or not ? Like is that to be  if that 's accurate then that would determine tourist node . grad c: If the context were to set one way or another , that like strongly   , says something about whether whether or not they 're tourists . grad c: So what 's interesting is when it 's not when it 's set to \" unknown \" . grad a: We - what set the they set the context to \" unknown \" ? grad d: OK . grad c: Right now we haven't observed it , so I guess it 's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities . grad a: And if we now do leave everything else as is the results should be the same , grad b: Oops . grad c: Well no , because we Th - the way we set the probabilities might not have Yeah , it 's it 's an it 's an issue , right ? Like grad a: Pretty much the same ? grad c: Yeah , it is . So the issue is that  in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then \" unknown \" as an actual value . What 's common is you just like don't observe the variable , grad d: Yeah . grad c: But  We didn't do this because we felt that there 'd I guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually grad b: We were thi Yeah , grad a:   grad b: We were th grad c: But  I don't know y what the right thing is to do for that . grad a: Why don't we Can we ,  How long would it take to to add another node on the observatory and , play around with it ? grad c: Another node on what ? grad b: well it depends on how many things it 's linked to . If we create something that for example would be  So th some things can be landmarks in your sense but they can never be entered ? So for example s a statue . grad a: So maybe we wanna have \" landmark \" meaning now \" enterable landmark \" versus ,  something that 's simply just a vista point , for example . grad a: Yeah ?  , a statue or  grad c: So basically it 's addressing a variable that 's \" enterable or not \" . grad b: Also you know , didn't we have a size as one ? The size of the landmark . grad c: What ? grad b: Cuz if it 's grad c:  . grad b: For some reason I had that OK , that was a thought that I had at one point but then went away . grad c: So you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered ? grad a: Well , for example , if we include that , yeah ? grad c: Yeah . grad a: accessibility or something , yeah ? \" Is it Can it be entered ? \" grad c:  . In the sense that , you know , if it 's Tom the house of Tom Cruise , you know , it 's enterable but you may not enter it . grad a: Yeah ? and  And these are very observable sort of from the from the ontology sort of things . grad b: Way Does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though ? Whether it 's practically speaking enterable , or actually physically enterable or not ? grad a: y y If If you 're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not al w you 're not usually not allowed to  m grad d: It seems like it would for  ,  determining whether they wanna go into it or not . grad b: Well I can see why grad d: Cuz they grad a: Let 's get this  b clearer . grad b: Whether it 's a Whether it 's a public building , and whether it 's actually has a door . grad a: This is sort of  grad b: So Tom Cruise 's house is not a public building grad d:   grad b: OK , sh explain to me why it 's necessary to distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public . Or , if something It seems like it 's equivalent to say that it doesn't have a door a and it grad a:   grad b: Or \" not public \" and \" not a door \" are equivalent things , grad a: Yeah . So we would have What does it mean , then , that we have to we have an object type statue . grad a: And then we have , for example , an object type , that 's a hotel . It 's the hotel Zum Ritter , which is the only Renaissance building in Heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the Thirty Years War , blah - blah - blah .  - And lots of detail , c and carvings , engravings and so forth , grad b: Excellent . So I guess your question is so far I have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities , from that point of view . Let Let 's do a Can we add , just so I can see how it 's done , a \" has door \" property or ? grad b: OK . grad c: What would it , connect to ? Like , what would , it affect ? grad a: I think , it might affect Oh actually it 's it it wouldn't affect any of our nodes , right ? grad c: What I was thinking was if you had a like grad a: Oh it 's it affects th The \" doing business \" is certainly not . grad b: You could affect Theoretically you could affect \" doing business \" with \" has door \" . grad a: right ? grad c: Yeah , I don't know if JavaBayes is nice about that . It might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable , you just like it just overwrites everything . Whew ! grad c: Well that 's fine , but we have to see the function now . grad b: This grad c: What would be nice if it is if it just like kept the old function for either value but . grad b: Oh wait , it might be Did we w Yes , that 's not good . grad a: Maybe you can read in ? grad c: Ha - So have you used JavaBayes a lot ? grad d: Yes . Really I ha I 've I haven't used it a lot and I haven't used it in the last you know many months so grad c: OK . grad c: Like , we looked at sort of  a page that had like a bunch of grad d: Yeah . grad c:  in a way this is a lot of good features in Java it 's cra has a GUI and it 's  grad d:   grad c: What ? grad b: Maybe it did a little bit of learning , grad c: OK . grad a: What is the c code ? Can w can we see that ? How do you write the code grad b: The c grad a: or do you actually never have to write any code there ? grad c: Yeah . grad b: Oh man , grad c: Like , there 's the grad b: I didn't n Is there an ampersand in DOS ? grad c: Nope . grad c: It 'll ask you what you what it wants what you want to open it with and see what BAT , I guess . grad c: That 's Oh ! grad b: Maybe it was just grad a: Oh . grad b: I like I like Word Pad because it has the  the returns , grad a: Wordpad ? I grad b: the carriage returns on some of them . grad b: You know how they get \" auto - fills \" I guess , grad a: Mmm  grad b: It just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of grad a:   grad b: It just that it 's grad c: But they 're not very friendly . grad b: Yeah the ordering isn't very clear on grad c: So you 'd have to like figure out Like you have to go and grad d: Right . grad c: it 's not grad b: We were doing it grad c: Yeah we can maybe write an interface th for  entering probability distributions easily , something like like a little script . I actually seem to recall Srini complaining about something to do with Entering probability so this is probably grad c: The other thing is it is in Java grad d: Yeah , it 's Yeah . grad b: Or grad a: Do you have the true source files or just the class ? grad b: I don't know if he actually grad c: Yeah . we do grad b: Does he grad c: I I saw directory called \" source \" , grad b: Oh . grad c: I think it might it might be simpler to just have a script that , you know It 's , like , friendly , grad d: The d the data tables . grad a: But if th if there is an XML file that or format that it can also read  it just reads this , right ? When it starts . grad b: Yeah I know there is an I was looking on the we web page and he 's updated it for an XML version of I guess Bayes - nets . grad c: The JavaBayes guy ? So but , e he doesn't use it . So in what sense has he updated it ? grad b: Well th you can either you ca or you can read both . grad b: Because  Well at least the  I could have misread the web page , I have a habit of doing that , but . grad a: So you got more slides ? grad b: Do I have more slides ?  yes , one more . E That 's maybe , I don't know If grad b:  that 's future future work . grad b: And of course if you have a presentation that doesn't have something that doesn't work at all , then you have \" What I learned \" , as a slide . grad b: I know what I like about these meetings is one person will nod , and then the next person will nod , and then it just goes all the way around the room . So this means  grad b: Should I pull up the net again ? grad d: Yeah . grad d: So a more general thing than \" discussed admission fee \"  , could be I I 'm just wondering whether the context , the background context of the discourse might be I don't know , if there 's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way  , there might be other cues that , say , in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes  , I don't know if that might be grad a:   I think we grad d: and and into that node would be various various things that that could have specifically come up . grad a: I think a a sort of general strategy here You know , this is this is excellent because  it gets you thinking along these terms is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of  discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . And maybe there are two  So maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer . Maybe this , you know , has some kind of  , funky thing that di if this and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something that is  , a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe . So things that point towards grad b: So instead of single node , for like , if they said the word \" admission fee \" grad d: Exactly . grad b: \" admission fee \" , or maybe , you know , \" how much to enter \" grad d: Yeah . Yeah ? And then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before ,  it 's more for  a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a in a in a route  , sort of proceeding past these things , so this would be just something that where you want to pass it .  ? Is that it ? However these are of course then the the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer . So this again points to \" final destination \" , \" doing business \" , \" tourist hurry \" and so forth . we have a whole region \" in a e grad d: That 's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer . grad d: Right ? grad a: So e because at the end the more we  add , you know , the more spider - web - ish it 's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing . They ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer ,  or the general hidden layer . grad a: And the same we will be able to do for syntactic information , the verbs used , the object types used , modifiers . grad b: One thing that 's kind of been bugging me when I more I look at this is that the I guess , the fact that the there 's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output . grad b: For instance if the discourse does grad d: What do you mean by that ? grad b: well for instance , the \" discourse admission fee \" node seems like it should point directly to the grad d:  - huh . grad b: or increase the probability of \" enter directly \" versus \" going there via tourist \" . Like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door . And if it if you do it If you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that like \" So how much has it cost to enter ? \" and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars , and then the persons says  \" Yeah I want to see it . \" Yeah ? meaning \" It 's way out of my budget \"  grad b: There are places in Germany where it costs two hundred fifty dollars to enter ? grad a: nothing comes to mind . But i you know , i we can Something Somebody can have discussed the admission fee and u the answer is s if we  , you know ,  still , based on that result is never going to enter that building . So the discourse refers to \" admission fee \" but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse . you have to have some notion of not just  there 's a there 's change across several turns of discourse grad b: Right . grad d: so I don't know how if any of this was discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general  , other other discourse processing that might be happen . grad b: What sort of discourse processing is  are the How much is built into SmartKom and grad a: It works like this . The first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t They tried to figure out the intention , right ? simply by parsing it . And this  m won't differentiate between all modes , yeah ? but at least it 'll tell us \" OK here we have something that somebody that wants to go someplace , now it 's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is is is happening , and  , if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed , what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is ,  o one of the most elaborate elaborate modules . It 's it 's actually the the whole memory of the entire system , that knows what wh who said what , which was what was presented . It helps an an anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted , so , because you say \" OK , how can I get to the castle ? \" Oh , how how much is it ? \" and  \" yeah I would like   to g let 's do it \" and so forth . So even without an a ana anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here . so whenever the  ,  person is not actually rejecting what happened before , so as in \" No I really don't want to see that movie . I 'd rather stay home and watch TV \"  What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step , by the discourse model discourse model , Yeah , that 's what it 's called . and , it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues . So a person pointing to something on the screen , you know , the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen grad b:  . grad a: so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing but   we can sort of It has a very clear interface . We can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and and the turn before that or you know how deep we want to search grad b: OK . How deep do we want to sear , you know ?  but we should try to keep in mind that , you know , we 're doing this sort of for research , so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to Adam and Eve . You know , did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life ? And the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise and Anyway . grad d: So one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of \" admission fee discussion \" as a cue for entry , is thinking about the plans that various people might have . This person is  , finding out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business .  , because then anything that 's a cue for one of the steps would be slight evidence for that overall plan . They 're in in non in sort of more traditional AI kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have you know , some idea at each turn of agent doing something , \" OK , wha what plans is this a consistent with ? \" and then get s some more information and then you see \" here 's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into \" . grad d: I I don't know how you know you 'd have to figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that . grad a: You know ? and it it 's fifty steps , grad d:   grad a: huh ? just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter , you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those . W when we talked  we had the example , you know , of you being  a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says New York and you say Track seven , huh ? And it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than \" New York \" , huh ? inferring everything from the context .  , even though there is probably no train from here to New York , right ? grad d: Mmm . Right ? Is that t San Francisco , Chicago ? grad b: I think grad a: Is that possible ? grad b: One time I saw a report on trains , and I think there is a l I don't know if I thought there was a line that went from somewhere , maybe it was Sacramento to Chicago , grad a:   grad d: The Transcontinental Railroad , doesn't that ring a bell ? grad b: Yeah but I don't know if it 's still grad d: I think it has to exist somewhere . grad a: Well it never went all the way , right ?  you always had to change trains at Omaha , grad d: Well most of the way . grad a: right ? One track ended there and the other one started at five meters away from that grad d:  . grad a: yeah ? Has anybody ever been on an Amtrak ? grad d: I have . grad c: What ? Why ? grad b: I just They seem to have a lot of accidents on the Amtrak . grad a: But you know , I don't know whether it 's which ones are safer , you know , statistically . Yeah , they 're Yeah , it 's way better grad a: yeah I used  Amtrak quite a bit on the east coast and I was surprised . grad a:  ? grad c: I I want to see what it does with  \" landmark - iness \" . grad d: So by the way tha that structure that Robert drew on the board was like more  , cue - type - based , right , here 's like we 're gonna segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse and then some of the things we 're talking about here are more you know , we mentioned maybe if they talk about  , I don't know , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based . grad d: So I I don't know if there There 's obviously some m more than one way of organizing the variables into something grad a: I think that  What you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks , and maybe some of their conditions . grad a: One task is more likely you 're in a hurry when you do that kind of s doing business , grad d:   grad a: and and less in a hurry when  you 're a tourist  tourists may have never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , grad d:   grad a: and then we 'll get these sub - middle layers , that are more cue - based . So ,  I suggest w to for to proceed with this in in the sense that maybe throughout this week the three of us will will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions , and we make up some some toy a observable \" nodes \" is that what th grad b: Refined y re just refine the grad a: What 's the technical term ? grad c: OK . For which ? grad a: For the  nodes that are observable ? The \" outer layer \" ? grad c: Just observable nodes , grad b: The features , grad c: evidence nodes ? grad b: I don't know , whatever you grad a: Feature ma make up some features for those Identify four regions , grad c: Yeah . grad a: maybe make up some features for each region and  and  ,  and  middle layer for those . And then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space grad c: Yeah . grad c: Yeah , this is totally like The probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc .  but , they 're even like  like , close to the end we were like , you know we were like  really ad - hoc . grad c: Right ? Cuz if it 's like ,  If it 's four things coming in , right ? And , say , some of them have like three possibilities and all that . So you 're thinking like like a hundred and forty four or something possible things numbers to enter , grad d: And That 's terrible . grad b: Some of them are completely absurd too , like they want to enter , but it 's closed , grad d: That 's  Well grad b: it 's night time , you know there are tourists and all this weird stuff happens at the line up and you 're like grad c: Yeah , the only like possible interpretation is that they are like come here just to rob the museum or something to that effect . grad d: In which case you 're supposed to alert the authorities , and see appropriate action . Yeah , another thing to do , is also to ,  I guess to ask around people about other Bayes - net packages . grad d: Sorry , Wednesday , grad b: Who 's talking on Wednesday ? grad c: Maybe we can ask him about it . grad b: I haven't J Jerry never sent out a sent out an email , did he , ever ? grad c: No . grad d: Ben ? grad a: Ben , then , grad d: I think it 's Ben actually , grad a: Ben . I actually  , have  , also we can  , start looking at the SmartKom tables and I will grad b: Right . grad b: Do you want to trade ? grad a: no I I actually made a mistake because it it fell asleep and when Linux falls asleep on my machine it 's it doesn't wake up ever , so I had to reboot grad d: Oh , no . grad a: And if I reboot without a network , I will not be able to start SmartKom , because I need to have a network . grad b:  grad a: So we 'll do that t maybe  grad c: But . But once you start sart start SmartKom you can be on You don't have to be on a network anymore . grad b: Why does SmartKom need a network ? grad a:  it looks up some stuff that , you know , is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a DHCP request , so it you know , my computer does not know its IP address , you know ? grad b: Ah . grad a: And I don't have an IP address , they can't look up they don't know who localhost is , and so forth and so forth . grad a: She 's willing to do it , meaning be the wizard for the data collection , also maybe transcribe a little bit , if she has to , but also recruiting subjects , organizing them , and so forth . Jerry however suggested that we should  have a trial run with her , see whether she can actually do all the  spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we  expect of the wizard . And I talked to Liz about this and it looks as if Friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data . grad c: So who would be the subject of this trial run ? grad a: Pardon me ? grad c: Who Will there be a Is one Is you one of you gonna be the subject ? Like are you grad a:  Liz also volunteered to be the first subject , which I think might be even better than us guys . grad a: If we do need her for the technical stuff , then of course one of you has to sort of  jump in . grad c: Well I just figured it has to be someone who 's , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , see if they 're you know good .  that 's what we wanna check , right ? grad a: grad d: Well , in this case it 's a p it 's a sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject . grad c: Isn't that what it is ? grad d: It 's  grad a: yes w we we would like to test the wizard , but you know , if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get a more realistic grad c: I guess that would be reasonable . grad d: I 'm sure if we  , You think there 's a chance we might need Liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? I 'm sure we can get other people around who don't know anything  , if we want another subject . So , is it a experimental setup for the  , data collection totally ready determined ? grad b: I like that . grad a:  I think it 's it 's it 's  experimental setup u on the technical issue yes , except we st I think we still need  a recording device for the wizard , just a tape recorder that 's running in a room . grad a: But  in terms of specifying the scenario ,    we 've gotten a little further grad d:   grad a: but  we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard , and have the wizard partake in the ultimate sort of definition probe . So so if if on Friday it turns out that she really likes it and and we really like her , then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and getting all the details completely figured out . So the ideal task  , will have whatever I don't know how much the structure of the evolving Bayes - net will af affect Like we wanna we wanna be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that , grad a: Mmm - yea - some . grad d: right ? in the course of the task ? Well not all of them but you know . grad a: Bu - e e e I 'm even This this Tango , Enter , Vista is sort of , itself , an ad - hoc scenario . So we wanted just to collect data , to get that that that elicits more , that elicits richer language . grad a: And we actually did not want to constrain it too much , grad d:   And then maybe we 'll discover the phenomenon the phenomena that we want to solve , you know , with whatever engine we we come up with . So this this this is a parallel track , you know , there they hopefully meet , grad d: OK . grad a: but since grad d: It could it could be used for not just this task . grad a: It should tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could occur , it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being grad d:   So it may get us some more information on the human - machine pragmatics , that no one knows anything about , as of yesterday . And secondly , now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this , and especially since  Johno can't stop Tango - ing , we may actually include , you know , those those intentions . So now I think we should maybe have at least one navigational task with with sort of explicit  grad d:   grad a: not ex it 's implicit that the person wants to enter , grad d:   grad a: and maybe some task where it 's more or less explicit that the person wants to take a picture , grad d:   grad a: Whereas , you know , if we 'd just get data we 'd never know what they actually wanted , we 'd get no cues . grad b: So is this the official end of the meeting now ? grad c: Yep . grad c: So what 's \" Economics , the fallacy \" ? grad a: Ma grad b: I just randomly label things . grad c: Oh , really ? grad a: Maybe we ought to switch off these things before we continue <doc-sep>OK , so , you 've got some , Xerox things to pass out ? phd a: Yeah , professor d: That are phd a:  .  , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font ! phd a: Next time we will put colors or something . phd a: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done professor d:  Go ahead . So since last week we 've started to fill the column with   features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely professor d:    phd a: well , it 's still not completely filled , professor d:  phd a: but we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and finally , hhh ,  ehhh PL -  delta seems very important . If you take  , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next t the second , part of the table , professor d:   phd a:  when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta . professor d: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , the baseline performance , phd a: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So professor d: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ? phd a: Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much   much smaller professor d: Yes . phd a: But , actually , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition , professor d:   phd a:  when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number , professor d:   phd a: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's we have one hundred and seventy - two , professor d: Yes . Yeah , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , that we did not have last week .  , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian . phd a: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on ,  TI - digits . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE ,  from  English digits , and from Italian digits . phd a: and  , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , so we have to to redo the  the experiment training the net with ,  PLP , but with delta . Well , it 's it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . The first one , yeah , is combining , two feature streams ,  using and each feature stream has its own MPL . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . You know you can you can comment these results , phd b: Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , mmm , if we doesn't use the delta - delta ,  we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when phd a: Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are  recognition accuracy . phd b: w Yeah , this Yeah , this number recognition acc phd a: So it 's not the Again we switch to another phd b: Yes , and the baseline the baseline have i is eighty - two . phd b: Yeah phd a: So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this . phd b: And first in the experiment - one I I do I I use different MLP , professor d:   And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy . phd a: Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP , professor d:   phd a: but this is not the case for Italian what where the error rate is c is almost  twice the error rate of PLP . phd a: So , well , I don't think this is a bug but this this is something in probably in the MSG  process that  I don't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the the there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But that we need to sort out if want to  get improvement by combining PLP and MSG professor d:   phd a: And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP . professor d: I  , the  , baseline system when you said the baseline system was  ,  eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was ,  Italian mismatched d  , digits , is the testing , phd b: Yeah . professor d: So the \" mismatch \" just refers to the noise and and ,  microphone and so forth , phd a: Yeah . professor d: right ? So ,  did we have So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is is the  Italian digits ? phd b: The train the training of the HTK ? professor d: The phd b: Yes . So ,  So what that says is that in a matched condition , we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the  PLP . Now w would do we have a number , I suppose for the matched I I don't mean matched , but  use of Italian training in Italian digits for PLP only ? phd b:  yes ? phd a:  yeah , so this is basically this is in the table . phd a: Fift - So No , it 's it 's the phd b: No . professor d: No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ? phd a: Of of of  eighteen phd b: Eighty . So  professor d: Oh this is accuracy !  phd a: so we have nine nine let 's say ninety percent . professor d: OK , so even just PLP , it is not , in the matched condition  I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping . It 's not Do you have this result with PLP alone , j fee feeding HTK ? professor d: So , s phd a: That That 's what you mean ? phd b: Yeah , phd a: Just PLP at the input of HTK . professor d: so adding MSG phd a:  professor d:  Well , but that 's yeah , that 's without the neural net , phd a: Yeah , that 's without the neural net professor d: right ? phd a: and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization . phd b:  phd a: Eighty - two is the it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use well , OGI , they use MFCC th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization professor d: Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy . phd a: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So professor d: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to to ninety , or something . phd a: Well , ninety No , I  ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight . So ,  So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you  does not help in that case . professor d: The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but And the multi - English , does  So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with ,  eighteen percent error rate , roughly . professor d:  and we  almost ,  cut that in half by  putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net . About ,  sixteen percent or something of the error , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition . OK ? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching , data for the  for the new for the other languages and so forth .  , one qu thing is that ,  I think I asked you this before , but I wanna double check . When you say \" ME \" in these other tests , that 's the multi - English , phd a: That 's it 's a part it 's professor d: but it is not all of the multi - English , right ? It is some piece of part of it . professor d: And the multi - English is how much ? phd b: You have here the information . professor d: Oh , so you used almost all You used two thirds of it , phd a: Yeah . So , it it 's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish . grad c: Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled , phd a: Yeah , it 's phd b: Yeah . Mmm , with the experiment type - two , I first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature another feature . phd b: And we s we can first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , and we can see that in the situation , the MSG - three , the same help nothing . phd b: And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta PLP delta and delta - delta . And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . And we have a l little bit less result than the the the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta . phd b: Maybe if when we have the new the new neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe the final result must be better . phd a: Actually , just to be some more phd b:  phd a: Do This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the professor d: Yes , yeah ,  it can't be compared with the other phd a: Which number ? professor d: cuz this is ,  with multi - English , training . professor d: So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , which is that ,  the eighty - four point six . professor d: So phd a: Yeah , but  in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net professor d: Yeah . phd b: No , but they they feature @ @ without phd a: So we use feature out  , net outputs together with features . So yeah , this is not perhaps not clear here but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features . So you 're saying w so asking the question , \" What what has adding the MLP done to improve over the , phd a: So , just Yeah so , actually it it it decreased the the accuracy . phd a: And even the MLP alone What gives the MLP alone ? Multi - English PLP . So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six , phd b: But phd a: that gives eighty - seven point one . Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh , OK , eighty - three point six and eighty eighty - eight point six . But I don't know but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help . professor d: Well , that 's that 's one thing , but see the other thing is that ,  it 's good to take the difficult case , but let 's let 's consider what that means . What what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that  my interpretation of your your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training . professor d: When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems . professor d: And , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and doesn't hurt us too much when it when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad . professor d: So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on ,  on say digits , phd a: On TI - digits ? OK .  , then does that , eh you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , does it does it then look much better ? phd a:   professor d: And so what is the range over these different kinds of  of tests ? So , an anyway . phd b: And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , d I have found more or less the same result . phd a: So , it 's slightly better , phd b: Little bit better ? phd a: yeah . professor d: And and you know again maybe if you use the , delta there , you would bring it up to where it was ,  you know at least about the same for a difficult case . phd a: It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output . And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , doesn't work professor d: Yeah . Because I for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one . professor d: by the way , there is a another , suggestion that would apply , to the second configuration , which , was made , by , Hari . And that was that , if you have  feed two streams into HTK , and you , change the ,  variances if you scale the variances associated with ,  these streams  , you can effectively scale the streams . Right ? So , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK , which is the rule here , you can still change the variances phd a:   professor d: And , so , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance . professor d: And , so this is just setting them to be , excuse me , of equal equal weight . professor d: Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , but but , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition . Yeah , you have to change the No , you can just do it in as once you 've done the training grad c: And then you can vary it . professor d: Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could you could just scale them all . But Is it i th  the HTK models are diagonal covariances , so I d Is it professor d: That 's  , exactly the point , I think , that if you change  , change what they are phd a:  . professor d: It 's diagonal covariance matrices , but you say what those variances are . professor d: So , that you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna it 's gonna it 's gonna internally multiply it and and  , i it im  implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's it 's gonna it 's it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the change the variances of some of the features . phd b: do ? professor d: So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , the s the strength that you apply the features . So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just just not the right thing to do . Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms because , you know , maybe it should be a different number for for each kind of test set , or something , phd a:   professor d: So I guess the other thing is to take you know if one were to take , you know , a couple of the most successful of these , phd a: Yeah , and test across everything . phd a: So , the next point , yeah , we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn , about their  , articulatory stuff ,  . phd a: discussion with Hynek , Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our our networks with their within their block diagram , where to plug in the the network , after the the feature , before as  a as a plugin or as a anoth another path , discussion about multi - band and TRAPS , actually Hynek would like to see , perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each  critical band . And he would like to replace these by a network which would , make the system look like a TRAP . Basically , this is a TRAP system kind of TRAP system , but where the neural network are replaced by LDA .  , yeah , and about multi - band , I started multi - band MLP trainings ,  mmh Actually , I w I w hhh prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . So I take exactly the same configurations , seven bands with nine frames of context , and we just train on TIMIT , and on the large database , so , with SPINE and everything . So , this would would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands , and but with a lot of context also . So  Yeah , we still have to work on Finnish , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages .  , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what everything that has been done . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on one , two , three , four , three , four , five , six , seven ten on ten different databases . phd a: the number of frames is bad also , so we have one million and a half for some , three million for other , and six million for the last one .  , yeah ! As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled , and perhaps this is what makes the difference . First ,  with respect to the on - line normalization , there are that use bad on - line normalization , and other good on - line normalization . With respect to the features , with respect to the use of delta or no ,  with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets . s What 's this ? We only have two hundred eighty six different tests And no not two thousand . phd b: I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the professor d: Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed , OK . but when the M - MLP is trained on the  is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features . Except if the features are bad  , actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized . In this case the tandem is still better even if it 's trained on not on the target digits . phd a: so the fourth point is , yeah , the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better the best network . professor d: So , on the MSG  problem  , I think that in in the  , in the short time solution  , that is , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress , phd a:   professor d: much as I said with JRASTA , even though I really like JRASTA and I really like MSG , phd a:   professor d: I think it 's kind of in category that it 's , it it may be complicated . professor d: And  it might be if someone 's interested in it , certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term , once we get out of this particular rush  for results . professor d: But in the short term , unless you have some some s strong idea of what 's wrong , phd a: I don't know at all but I 've perhaps I have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite quite simple or just like nnn , no high - pass filter professor d: Yeah , probably . professor d: There 's supposed to well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though , right ? phd a: It 's There is , yeah , an AGC - kind of AGC . professor d: Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be  , yeah , phd a: Mmm . professor d: In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design , phd a:  . Are your results are still with the bad the bad phd b: Maybe , may No ? With the better phd a: With the O - OLN - two ? phd b: No ? phd a: Ah yeah , you have you have OLN - two , phd b: Oh ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! With \" two \" , with \" on - line - two \" . professor d: \" Two \" is good ? phd a: And professor d: No , \" two \" is bad . It 's probably something simple  , i if if  someone , you know , wants to play with it for a little bit . professor d: but but my my guess would be that it 's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find . That 's that what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task If it 's on the target task then it it it helps to have the MLP transforming it . professor d: If it  if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is ,  you can get  , a reduction in performance . professor d: And the question is now how to how to get one and not the other ? Or how to how to ameliorate the the problems . professor d: because it it certainly does is nice to have in there , when it when there is something like the training data . So , the the reason Yeah , the reason is that the perhaps the target the the task dependency the language dependency , and the noise dependency professor d: So that 's what you say th there . phd a: Well , the e e But this is still not clear because , I I I don't think we have enough result to talk about the the language dependency . Well , the TIMIT network is still the best but there is also an the other difference , the fact that it 's it 's hand - labeled .  , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones but it 's  Just  , have a seat . s Summary of the first  ,  forty - five minutes is that some stuff work and works , and some stuff doesn't OK , phd a: We still have  this One of these perhaps ? phd b: Yeah .  professor d: Yeah , I guess we can do a little better than that but I think if you if you start off with the other one , actually , that sort of has it in words and then th that has it the associated results . So you 're saying that  , although from what we see , yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we don't do as well as in the target thing . But you 're saying that  , it is Although that general thing is observable so far , there 's something you 're not completely convinced about . What what do you mean ? phd a: mmm , that the the fact that s Well , for for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best ,  which is the English net . But you have two two effects , the effect of changing language and the effect of training on something that 's Viterbi - aligned instead of hand hand - labeled . professor d: Do you think the alignments are bad ?  , have you looked at the alignments at all ? What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ? phd a: Mmm . Because , that is just looking but  ,  It 's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment . But , perhaps it 's not really the the alignment that 's bad but the just the ph phoneme string that 's used for the alignment professor d: Aha ! phd a: Mmm .  professor d: The pronunciation models and so forth phd a:  for We It 's single pronunciation ,  professor d: Aha . phd a: so we asked people to listen to the  the sentence and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them .  , the third The third  issue is the noise dependency perhaps but , well , this is not clear yet because all our nets are trained on the same noises and professor d: I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth . professor d: OK , yeah , just don't just need more more results there with that @ @ .  , with respect to the network size , there 's one experiment that 's still running and we should have the result today , comparing network with five hundred and one thousand units . We can , we can tell which training set gives the best result , but we don't know exactly why . professor d: \" Multi - multi - English \" just means \" TIMIT \" , phd a: Yeah . professor d: It 's sort of , yes it 's mul it 's multi -  - purpose . So Yeah , the training targets actually , the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency and the noise dependency . And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets . For moment you use we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets , and perhaps even ,  use networks that doesn't do classification but just regression so  , train to have neural networks that  , professor d:   phd a: does a regression and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . phd a:  professor d: Yeah , that seems like a good thing to do , probably ,  not  again a short - term sort of thing . professor d:  one of the things about that is that  it 's e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being is being dependent on very dependent on the kind of noise and and so forth . phd a: So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this this could be could help could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part  we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network , phd b: Yeah . phd a: and So this is one approach and the other is multi - band  , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes . phd a: So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with  , features - based targets could could could help . professor d: Yeah , if you i i It 's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up  w yeah , one one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have  some reasonable database ,  but then which is  copied over many times with a range of different noises , phd a:   professor d: And  If Cuz what you 're trying to do is come up with a a core , reasonable feature set which is then gonna be used  , by the the   system . The future work is , well , try to connect to the to make to plug in the system to the OGI system . professor d: And I guess , you know , the the the real open question , e u there 's lots of open questions , but one of the core quote \" open questions \" for that is  , if we take the  you know , the best ones here , maybe not just the best one , but the best few or something You want the most promising group from these other experiments .  , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ? phd a: Mmm , professor d:  . professor d: y Right ? And then  then see , again , how We know that there 's a mis there 's a  a a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than than ,  we 're gonna test on , but well , if you look over a range of these different tests  , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features ,  stand up over that range ? phd b:   And  , take let 's say , just take  multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training . How does that How does that compare between the phd a: So all the all the test sets you mean , yeah . professor d: All the different test sets , phd a: And professor d: and for and for the couple different ways that you have of of of combining them . And perhaps doing this for cha changing the variance of the streams and so on getting different scaling phd b:   Yeah , so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the to their diagram . Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn , they they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates , professor d: Yeah . It 's a little strange phd a: or ? Mmm ? professor d: but on the other hand they did it before . And because also perhaps we know that the when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help .  , we we wanna get their path running here , right ? If so , we can add this other stuff . professor d: as an additional path right ? phd a: Yeah , the the way we want to do professor d: Cuz they 're doing LDA RASTA . phd a: The d What ? professor d: They 're doing LDA RASTA , phd a: Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to just to get the VAD labels and the final features . professor d: yeah ? phd a: So they will send us the Well , provide us with the feature files , professor d: I see . phd a: and with VAD  , binary labels so that we can  , get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream . First thing of course we 'd wanna do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them . You mean Oh , yeah ! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ? professor d: Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we have we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK . But ,  just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results so we can duplicate it before we add in another phd a: Mmm . Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA , I don't know if we want to We can try networks with LogRASTA filtered features . But professor d: Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb I 'm I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . that u  , when you 're talking about combining multiple features ,  Suppose we said , \" OK , we 've got these different features and so forth , but PLP seems pretty good . We have different languages , we have different different noises ,  If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps with them . What what What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . That is , that yes , if you knew what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , and then you fed the thing ,  something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . So you you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but professor d: It works better if what ? phd a: Yea professor d: I see . Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f for this kind of task , I would think , sort of a modest amount . We have a modest amount of of  training data from a couple different conditions , and then  in yeah , that and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type  , and  , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have  , the data to train up  one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in we still don't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in  , a fe few different databases and  the performance is getting worse and  , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is is is is is better . And  that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another we don't have  , seemingly , the ability to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , all of the variability that we 're gonna be covering . So that I 'm I 'm I 'm hoping that  , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , that  if we if they look at more constrained conditions they they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them .  i i e The  I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA RASTA , which is a kind of LogRASTA , it 's just that they have the  it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , and it 's it  it 's just that they d it 's trained up , right ? That that  benefitted from on - line normalization . So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ?  they they were not not using the neural net . We 've been sort of ignoring that , haven't we ? phd a: Yeah , so I don't know . professor d: But phd a: But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we professor d: Yeah , but I li Well , I think My impression You you folks have been looking at this more than me . But my impression was that  , there was a a a a strict constraint on the delay , phd b: Yeah . professor d: but beyond that it was kind of that  using less memory was better , and using less CPU was better . We have to get some reference point to where we Well , what 's a reasonable number ? Perhaps be because if it 's if it 's too large or large or @ @ professor d: well I don't think we 're  completely off the wall .  I think that if we if we have  ,  the ultimate fall back that we could do If we find   we may find that we we 're not really gonna worry about the M L You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in . professor d: If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , we might even have more than one MLP . professor d: And it 's  We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that .  , what what are they What are they gonna be working Do we know what they 're gonna be working on while we take their features , phd a: They 're They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band . Sunil , what was he doing , do you remember ? phd b: Sunil ? phd a: Yeah . He was doing something new or ? phd b: I I don't re I didn't remember . phd a: I think they were also mainly , well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , but mainly trying to tune their their system as it is now to just trying to get the best from this this architecture . So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get There 'd be some point where you say , \" OK , this is their version - one \" or whatever , and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them , phd a:   We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then  , when it gets to be  , January some point  , we say , \" OK we we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . So now   what 's your newest version ? \" And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better and then we we 'd combine it .  I I I used to work with  folks who were trying to improve a good  ,  system with  with a neural net system and  , it was a common problem that you 'd Oh , and this Actually , this is true not just for neural nets but just for in general if people were working with  , rescoring  , N - best lists or lattices that come came from  , a mainstream recognizer .  , You get something from the the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring . So by the time you have  , improved their score , they have also improved their score phd a: Mmm . professor d: So , I guess at some point we 'll have to phd a: So it 's professor d: I I don't know . I think we 're we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases . I think at the moment they they say that they have a better thing we can we e e phd a: Mmm . professor d: What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things , presumably  , in a in a day we could turn around  , taking a new set of things from them and and rescoring it , phd a: Mmm . I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the  , you know , different trainings . So we we can for we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps , professor d: That 's sort of wide open . phd a: or focus more on the targets and on the training data and ? professor d: Yeah , I think for right now  , I th I I really liked MSG . And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . And  , I think that there is ultimately a really good  , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties .  , but  , we only have limited time and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at . professor d: And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets , and fitting in  what we 're doing with what they 're doing , and , you know , with limited time . And then , you know , once we  , having gone through this process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things  , come up that you are curious about  , that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation  , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested  and  and and work with it , you know , for the next round .  , as you can tell from these numbers  , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem . professor d: Well I figured that , but That what what what were you involved in in this primarily ? grad c: helping out  , preparing Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been  ,  w doing some work on the on the preparing all all the data for them to to  , train and to test on . Right now , I 'm I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class . What 's what 's that ? grad c: I 'm trying to  So there was a paper in ICSLP about  this this multi - band  , belief - net structure . grad c:  basically it was two H M Ms with with a with a dependency arrow between the two H M professor d:  - huh . grad c: And so I wanna try try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . And  , I 'm just gonna see if if that that better models  ,  asynchrony in any way or  Yeah . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need You happy with where we are ? phd a: Mmm . professor d: Know know wher know where we 're going ?  phd a: I think so , yeah . grad e: Al - actually I should mention So if  , about the Linux machine \" Swede . grad e: And  Dan Ellis I believe knows something about using that machine so phd a: Mmm . grad e: If people are interested in in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that . phd a: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . professor d: Right ?  there 's there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU  , for training and so on ? Yeah . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know We just select what works fine professor d: OK . to work professor d: And we 're OK on And we 're OK on disk ? phd a: and It 's OK , yeah . Alright , so  , since  , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . We didn't  I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , pretty easily . OK , so we 'll  I 'll start off the   connect the phd a: My battery is low <doc-sep>You know how to toggle the display width function grad a: Well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet .  , so we haven't had a meeting for a while , and and probably won't have one next week , I think a number of people are gone .  , so Robert , why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with EDU ? grad b:  in a in a smaller group we had  , talked and decided about continuation of the data collection . So Fey 's time with us is almost officially over , and she brought us some thirty subjects and , t collected the data , and ten dialogues have been transcribed and can be looked at . She 's actually suggested to look  , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements . And  , we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time , two days , for example , to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time , and , sort of package the whole thing in a in a re in a few more complicated  , structure . As for SmartKom , I 'm the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis , which as of this morning should be resolved . grad b: \" should be \" means they aren't yet , but but I think I have the info now that I need . Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow , so maybe   , when tomorrow is over , we 're done . And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again Maybe it 'll take some more time , to be realistic , but at least we 're we 're seeing the end of the tunnel there .  , the  ,  I don't think we need to discuss the formalism that 'll be done officially s once we 're done .  , something happened , in on Eva 's side with the PRM that we 're gonna look at today , and  , we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University . grad a: So when you said \" Andreas \" I thought you were talking about Stolcke . grad b: And , grad a: Now I know that we aren't , OK . grad b: Eh grad c: Cuz there is another Andreas around , grad a:  . grad b: So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University , one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied . And , the  , he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he 's actually doing , and why it is s somewhat related , and by  using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using .  , so , I 've be just been looking at , Ack ! What are you doing ? Yeah .  , so , this is , sort of like the latest thing I have on it , and I sorta constructed a couple of classes . Like , a user class , a site class , and and you know , a time , a route , and then and a query class . And I tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually  , look at it more .  , so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , and then tried to The red lines on the , graph are the  , relations between the different  , classes . Like , a user has like , a query , and then , also has , you know  , reference slots to its preferences , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest . And so this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that . And So I tried to construct the dependency models , and a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on , and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see how I can do ,  put in the computational nodes in between . And so I ended up making several classes Actually , you know , a class of with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility . And so some of these classes are s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . S like , these here , it 's only like , user , but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the  , preference of the user is versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or you know , which form of transportation the user has and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case . And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites in in mind . And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , and that makes a I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . And so , I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , cuz otherwise you would c well , it 's probably the same . But  , No , you would definitely have be able to re - use , like , all the user stuff , and not not having to recompute a lot of the stuff , because it 's all from the user side . But , you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how  , using the PRM will help .  , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes . And that would basically it 's just another class in the model , with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . And then , after you group them together this no the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this .  , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff . And one is basically how desirable a site is meaning , how good it matches the needs of a user .  , so , instead of  , doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of the user wants to visit , I 'll come well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . And for each site , you know , where h how how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it . She 's ac   Eva 's got a little write - up on it that  , probably gives the the details to anybody who needs them .  , so the You you didn't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation . So one so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is grad d:   professor f: we aren't gonna build our own interpreter , so if if we can't find one , then we  , go off and do something else and wait until s one appears .  , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down . If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually  , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it .  , I actually think it is cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , will help in the expression . I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net , without going to some incredible hacking of sort of rebuilding it on the fly .  , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net . So , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert i it looked to me like if Eva were able to come up with a you know , value for each of a number of  , sites plus its EVA thing , that a travel planner should be able to take it from there . And you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever , and then plan a route . grad b:  -  , well , first of all  , great looks , mu much cleaner , nnn , nnn , Certain certain beauty in it , so , if beauty is truth , then ,  we 're in good shape . So if you have a write - up then  , I 'd love to read it grad d:   grad b: and  because , i Can you go all the way back to the the very top ? grad d: Yeah . grad b:  these @ @ these w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ? grad d: I can't really see the whole thing . grad b: or are they have they changed , in a sense ? grad d: Well I think I basically leave them to similar things . grad d: Some of the things might that might be different , maybe like are that the hours for the site . grad d: And , eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not . grad d: And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction , and and or stuff like that . grad b: And the , other question I would have is that presumably , from the way the Stanford people talk about it , you can put the probabilities also on the relations . I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not , grad a: Mmm . grad b: It 's sort of in the definition or in the in Daphne 's definition of a PRM is that classes and relations , professor f: OK . grad b: and you 're gonna have CPT 's over the classes and their relations . grad d: I remember them learning when , you know , you don't know the structure for sure , professor f: Yeah . grad d: but I don't remember reading how you specify grad b: Yeah , that would be exactly my question . So , the the plan is is when Daphne gets back , we 'll get in touch and supposedly , we 'll actually get s deep seriously connected to to their work and grad b: Yep . professor f: somebody 'll  , you know If it 's a group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever . We get rocking and rolling on this again , once we get a package , if , when , and how , then this becomes foregrounded grad d:   grad b: And  , until then we 'll come up with a something that 's @ @ that 's way more complicated for you . grad b: Because this was laughingly easy , right ? grad d: Actually I had to take out a lot of the complicated stuff , cuz I I made it really complicated in the beginning , and Jerry was like , \" this is just too much \" . So , you could , from this , go on and say suppose there 's a group of people traveling together and you wanted to plan something that somehow , with some Pareto optimal  , thing for grad a: That 's good . professor f: or grad a: Except for humans can't really solve it either , so . Well that 's the that would that would be a  , you could sell it , as a grad a: Yeah . professor f: OK , eh you don't have to fight about this , just give your preferences to the grad a: And then you can blame the computer . But what does it  Would a pote potential result be to to split up and never talk to each other again ? You know . So there i there are some some u  , you know , elaborations of this that you could try to put in to this structure , but I don't think it 's worth it now . But  , it 's good , yeah and and there were a couple other ideas of of  , things for Eva to look at in in the interim . So , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's  that 's relevant to you  , a at the moment , the the reason is really for me  , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . And and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , and  , I just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and and so I 'll be  , happy to talk to you and and  , I 'd also like to find out some more and and maybe I 'll just walk around the office and and then and ask some some questions , in a couple days . OK , so , what I started looking at , to begin with is just  , content management systems  , i i in general . So  ,  what 's  Sort of the state of the art there is to   you have a bunch of of  documents or learning units or learning objects , and you store meta - data  , associate to them . So there 's some international standards like the I - triple - E ,  There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard , and  , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have  author information , you have  , size information , format information and so on . One is  you store keywords associated with the  with the document , and one is  , you have sort of a , well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic  , ordering of of the of the units . Now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses ,  you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit  , assumption behind that is that  , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of  , whichever taxonomy is used , and  , I think that 's a that 's a very that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and  As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , science , biology , and then But that 's really all that we have at the moment . Now , what this  a standard like this would give us is we could  , sort of  with a search engine just query  , different repositories all over the world . But we can't really  , so what I 'm what I try to do is  , to have  ,  So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . Now , what what we have at our university quite a bit is that  , students  , try to u program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same problems , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and so , what I want to build is basically a a smart F A Q system . Now , what you  need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than \" I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . I 'm I 'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , context it , and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . So , I want to be able to model information like , so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , maybe what 's the background of that student 's  , which  , which error message was encountered . Now , basically giving this   so we somehow need to have a formalized  , way of writing this down basically , and that 's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again . And , using this and some some  , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some some simple inferences . Like you know that when somebody 's working about  , working on on servlets for example , he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used are written in Java . So some some inferences like that , now , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of  off the documents you 're you 're searching against . So ,  what I wanna do is basically have some sort of  given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match , and use this as a metric in the search . Now , what I plan to do is I want to  sort of do a   try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth  ,  steepest descent approach . So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? And and having  ,  a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , and find out which  which questions are worth  , asking . And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is  , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system  quickly , that that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . And   , so Robert was mentioning  , earlier today is that  , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network , which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . And so ,  what I 'm What I try to do is basically try to model this  , in a way that you could really combine  , knowledge from very different sources , and and  , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community  , came up with . Trying to to have  , an approach how to integrate s  certain  representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , what you can do with those . What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic  , computational model . And then  ,  sort of as an add - on to this whole idea ,  that would be now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which  , which  , rules and which ontologies it it uses , or basically its view of the world ,  you can get very different results . And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach , where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , and  , if you have a question about a homework , it 's probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , rather than going to some Yahoo - like  , search engine . And I think a lot of the even though it 's a it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , issues are are fairly similar . grad a: And so some of the I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , I Are you grad c:  I know , yeah I know abou about it . It 's like , you know , the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret , grad c:   We - we 've kind of talked about that , but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse . grad b: Well , in a in one t one s mmm , small difference in a in a way , is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer , but he wants to point to the places w w grad a: Documents that have the answers . So I 'm I 'm not I 'm not building an expert grad a: you have to s still m understand what the content says about itself , and then match it to what you think the informational needs grad a:   You 're just taking the keywords as a topic text , as grad c: I I assume that that the there will be learning systems that that tag their their content . grad c: And  , m @ @ and basically what I what I envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an FAQ for example you could state sort of like a logic condition , when this document applies . So \" this document explains how to set up your  , mail account on Linux \" or something like this . So something something very specific that you can then But the I think that the key point with these  , learning systems is that  , a learning system is only as good as  the amount of content it it carries . grad c: You can have the best learning system with the best search interface , if there 's no content inside of it , it 's not very useful . So I think ultimately because  ,  developing these these rules and these inference  inferences I think is very costly , so  ,  I think you must be able to reuse some some existing  , domain domain information , or or or ontologies that that  other people wrote and then try to integrate them , and then also search the entire web basically , rather than just the small  , content management system . grad c: So I think that 's that 's crucial for for the success of or @ @ grad a: So , you 're not I guess I 'm trying to figure out how how it maps to the kinds of things that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups , grad c:   grad a: cuz some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses , and I 'm guessing that you you won't be doing that ? OK . grad a: So , you take the query , and and professor f: On the other hand , FrameNet could well be useful . professor f: Because , you know , the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames , and the frames may well give you additional keywords or  , if you know that that that a a bunch of keywords  , indicate a frame , then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame , rather th than just  , individual grad c: Mmm . There 's linguists and stuff and there 's a lot of it and they 're they 're busily working away . And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that . I 'm sure I could learn a lot about  , yeah , just how to how to come up with these structures , grad a: Mmm . grad c: cuz it 's it 's very easy to whip up something quickly , but it maybe then makes sense to to me , but not to anybody else , and and if we want to share and integrate things , they must well , they must be well designed really . grad b: And Andreas and I tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with a eh with him working on an interface for FrameNet , as it was back then , that would p do some of the work for this machine , professor f: Right . grad b: which  , never got done because Prashant found a happy occupation professor f: W yeah , I know ,  it it he w he did w what what he did was much more s sensible for him . professor f: I think  , grad b: But so I 'm just saying , the  , we had that idea professor f: you know Yeah . professor f: Yeah , actually you guys never grad b: And Srini 's doing information extraction also , right ? professor f: Right . grad c: professor f: this was supposedly an exchange program , and I we you know , it 's fine . We don't care , but it just I 'm a little surprised that  , Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send .  I had forgotten a I To be honest with you , I 'd totally forgotten we had a program . grad b:  it 's in the program ? grad c:  I I think it 's it 's really the lack of students  , at IU at the moment . I think it 's ju it 's more the lack of of students , really , and w we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams . grad c: Well  if if I were a student , I 'd love to come here , rather than work for some German company , or professor f: Yeah . professor f: Oh , right ! grad c: Well , I didn't say anybody to anything to offend well , except for the sponsors maybe , but professor f: Right . So I thi tha that 's that 's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you 're here . professor f: unfortunately , Srini , who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town . professor f: I don't know why he @ @ oh , I , who knows ? grad a: The  professor f: Anyway , s yeah , you 'll see you 'll certainly see a lot of the people there . grad a: The other person I thought of is Dan Gildea ? because he did some work on topic spotting professor f: Yeah . I don't Depending on how well you wanna integrate with that end , grad c:   grad a: you know , like , taking the data and fig you said the learning systems that figure out We There 's someone in ICSI who actually has been working on has worked on that kinda stuff , and he 's worked with frame net , so you could talk to him about , you know , both of those things at once . grad c: So , who is that again ? grad a: And , he 's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff , grad b: Who ? I can take you to his office . professor f: Alright , was there anything else for this ? One of these times soon we 're gonna hear about construal . professor f: Good thinking ! grad b:  well , maybe I can I can bribe my way out of this . professor f: Well , no , but he 's he 's he 's he 's as you said , he 's , like the state legislature , he 's trying to offer us bribes . grad b: This  Oh , they refused the budget again ? Is it so about CITRIS ? Yeah , still nothing . professor f: this this this t the s we 're , involved in a literally three hundred million dollar  , program . And , the State of California is now a month and a half behind its legis its legally required date to approve a budget . professor f: and , yesterdayday there was this   I thought that the other branch would just approve it , but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who who approved it got flak from there , eh anyway . So ,  Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , OK ? And then we 'll go . In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS , even though we don't have the money they So they 've been hiring people right and left , so , they think the money 's coming . And , is now doing all the politics for CITRIS , but also , has a  , a lot of interest in  , actually doing things for society , so digital divide and stuff like that . But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , something that is of great social value . He said , \" for example \" , this was his only example , \" if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , and as compelling as a video game , then that would have a huge social impact \" . So it was nice that  , he 's got this view , of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B , language would be a good way to do it . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing , grad a:  - huh . professor f: but , you know , a again , if if you if you grad a: Oh . So this is reading , rather than teaching Another project we started on , and and didn't get funded for was , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , for kids whose first language wasn't English . So , enormous problem in California , and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build  , programs that would be tutors for the kids . professor f: and  , I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now , but it i it 's it 's interesting and I may  , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that . So I I did manage to get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS , professor f: No , no . grad b: but , I I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n  among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings , professor f: Yeah . grad b: and also revising , thanks for all the comments , the c the original construal proposal . And , if I put one and one together , I may end up with a number that 's greater than one and that I I can potentially present once you get back . Yeah , so OK , so that 'd be great , but I 'd I think it 's it 's time again , right ? grad b: Absolutely . grad b: But  , and hopefully all sidetracking  , other things will have disappeared , soon "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on trend watching, appearance design, and product components, as well as the project manager's opinions towards product appearance.",
        "Summary": "The marketing team highlighted three important trends: the desire for fancy and identifiable products, the need for technological innovation, and the importance of ease of use. Additionally, they noted that fruit and vegetable themes were popular, and the idea of a spongy texture was well-received. The group agreed that the remote control should resemble fruit and vegetables in shape and color, but the specific design was not yet determined. The industrial designer proposed two options: a titanium material with a fruity scent or a spongy and fruity-like material. However, the project manager stated that they couldn't have both options and suggested painting the controller to mimic titanium instead. The final decision was not made. The user interface designer suggested a red and yellow color scheme and two basic shapes, a circle and a triangle, referred to as the mushroom design. However, the marketing team disagreed with the mushroom design and decided to change it to a pineapple shape. The group decided to produce a mid-sized remote control with various components such as a printed circuit board, chip, transistor, scroll wheel, power cradle, locator, radio transmitter, antenna, speaker, double curves, LEDs, and buttons. The casing material would be a combination of rubber and plastic. Based on previous experiments and questionnaires, the marketing team found that most users considered remote controls to be ugly. Therefore, the group aimed to create a fancy-looking product to justify a higher price. However, determining what constitutes \"fancy\" was challenging due to differing opinions. The project manager agreed that the product should be visually appealing but cautioned against using too many colors to avoid increasing costs. Additionally, the project manager suggested incorporating an image that represents society on the remote control for easy recognition.",
        "Article": "So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and  industrial designer: Industrial Design . project manager: And after that we  will have the  new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . project manager: No , industrial designer: Three three , it's three project manager: I'm participant one . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our  remote T_V_ control . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . So how can we  design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?  , let's move to next slide . As we know  Google it's a very successful because his  powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . project manager: user interface: So my job is to  design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So industrial designer: user interface: That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation . user interface:  With sophisticated functions , project manager: So powerful , user interface: but with very yeah powerful . marketing: So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , industrial designer: To merge the two system huh . marketing: industrial designer: But But this is user interface: But if we have very very good user interface marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . project manager: Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . industrial designer: So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that So . project manager: Go on , go back and industrial designer: Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright . marketing: industrial designer: It you project manager: So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . marketing: industrial designer: The rationale must be design , or project manager: So , Baba is the  the Industrial Designer . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know  to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the project manager: industrial designer: how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . industrial designer: but I propose a nifra infrared base you know , so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ project manager: marketing: industrial designer: so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to marketing: True . project manager: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? industrial designer: I think it's cheaper than laser , so . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen , marketing: What the cost is ? project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have   Let's see . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here project manager: You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . project manager: What is this ? industrial designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . industrial designer: So and the next slide , it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless . industrial designer: Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ? marketing: What's the average price of this technology then ? industrial designer: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the user interface: So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire with remote control ? industrial designer: You'd yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . project manager: So you think that  a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea . project manager: No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu marketing: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , user interface: Wireless remote control . project manager: but marketing: I don't think well , yeah , I don't think he would , industrial designer: Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know , project manager: marketing: but in a sense industrial designer: sometime I want to have wire because you know . project manager: Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have  linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? industrial designer: project manager: I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ? industrial designer: I don't think it will be too much . industrial designer: Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know project manager: Okay . industrial designer: I think wha wha with the wire it's  cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . marketing: Now the project manager: So industrial designer: Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . project manager: I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , marketing: Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else  . We had one hundred subjects , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , and see what was okay or not for them .  actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls  ugly , okay , so that's project manager: You mean the loo the look , the outside ? industrial designer: The look , how it look like . So this is where we could have  yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more . And then  yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . And  users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . project manager: marketing: So this is from the experiments we've done , project manager: marketing: so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .  it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And  remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . project manager: What is R_S_I_ ? marketing: R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same  doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . marketing: Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . marketing: And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of  functions , but less buttons , user interface: Functions . And just to have  an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? user interface: But I'm not sure project manager: Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . project manager: I think the marketing: It's user interface: No you you can have a switch menu , so you can project manager: Yeah , but it has to be intuitive . Then for  you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . Okay , user interface: Then you you put the switch button , project manager: but user interface: then it switch to another category of functions . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your  recorder . industrial designer: With a user interface: So there's a different functions , but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . project manager: Yeah , but user interface: But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . marketing: industrial designer: This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people . user interface: marketing: Yeah , this is something we sh user interface: Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and  uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so . industrial designer: I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard project manager: Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . user interface: Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: And also f user interface: Maybe we can have di di we can have  several options , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , marketing: Yeah , user interface: project manager: and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as  previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as  it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . project manager: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ . project manager: So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ? marketing: Yeah , it's done , just yeah . If we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it . project manager: So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that  for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's user interface: project manager: It's is  marketing: Lame , or project manager: No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext . project manager: So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , industrial designer: Yep . project manager: and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not you won't be  you won't had  buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . project manager: It's marketing: - project manager: because if we want to to do remote control user interface:  . project manager: which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . project manager: So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . project manager: And also we want the image of the   real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . project manager:  that's  if  you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . project manager: So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the   user interface: Okay . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so . project manager: industrial designer: This is marketing: I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . project manager: but mayb industrial designer: Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . user interface: A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ . industrial designer: It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . industrial designer: the global usage , user interface: Global , industrial designer: so if people don't have the technology . project manager: So everybody is okay with the new requirements ? user interface: So I I so As as for the colour , what what do you think ? project manager: I think it has to be yellow . user interface: Yellow ? T_V_ remote control ? marketing: Min project manager: Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised . industrial designer: I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Doesn't need to be completely yellow , project manager: So you have to user interface: Okay . It's okay ? marketing: Regarding the first line , what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .  Y you You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put  pon marketing: Industrial Designer . project manager: And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder <doc-sep>marketing: So do we need to re-train Mike on how to put his mic on ? project manager: We may do . industrial designer: Think s marketing: Okay , can he get it all by himself this time ? project manager: I dunno , I'm feeling like a big boy . Pro marketing: industrial designer: Probably not , 'cause he's 'S been listening to too much . We're gonna all do a presentation , and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now .  you've got a printed a printed  circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate marketing: project manager: We've all broke a remote control ri  s yeah . industrial designer: marketing: I've user interface: So you've also got  you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . industrial designer: Yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and project manager: You press this and it does th user interface: Well marketing: Yeah y do jabber user interface: so you've got here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , industrial designer: user interface:  you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the   on the end of the printed circuit board . user interface: So  we've got a i in this in this  drawing he  in this example here , this is a eighteen pin   chip I dunno . You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed ,  th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . user interface: I don't know if that's really marketing: I I gotta I gotta flashlight , and  user interface: I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so industrial designer: project manager: Okay . user interface: So that's the next bullet is the  the kinetic provision of energy , marketing: And that's on the camera . user interface:  we've got solar cells , which I don't think is a very good idea because  you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make a lot of sense . project manager: Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ? user interface: M battery versus cradle I think is yeah . project manager: It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty , just to be actually serious for a minute here , user interface: Yeah . project manager: you could user interface: Well it is it is more   it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . Our material choices are a plastic latex  ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing ,  wood , or titanium . If we go with titanium we're gonna be  limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and  Yeah pers project manager: Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it . user interface: I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , you know . We can we can o we can  accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it . user interface: And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these .  my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it  to mak  like a thick plastic inner shell and a t  kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic . user interface: Yeah  marketing: And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . user interface: The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more  options just in terms of shape industrial designer: marketing: user interface: because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . So  and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so  project manager: Okay . user interface: But basically these are curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department , in their  in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . user interface: but that's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved . industrial designer: user interface: I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes project manager: Okay . project manager: I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a marketing: - yeah that's yeah that's what I see .  okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display , marketing: Ooh .  so these are all options that the user interface guy can  has at his disposal to put together a user interface . A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you , project manager: user interface: a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense  project manager: D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ? user interface: Yes the difference is , with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why doesn't this scroll up ? Previous previous , okay . user interface:  an advanced chip is required to to operate  the L_C_D_ display , and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . project manager: Technical functions or interface concept ? user interface: I think industrial designer: Oh interface concept . user interface: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . It it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and user interface: If the T_V_ is working , yeah . project manager: user interface: That's just  it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel . industrial designer: Yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , user interface: So industrial designer: and I think that's one of the things we wanna keep . project manager: But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? So if you pressed it and went , up ? industrial designer: That kinda would r d user interface: Well then why don't you just press the up button ? project manager: Man yeah . project manager: But if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go Up . user interface: Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ . user interface: It might not be it might not be completely confusing , but I think you'll still y it's still marketing: user interface: I don't think it's practical at all . industrial designer: Yeah so  taking that away , our  the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable project manager: You guys know your stuff . industrial designer: it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . Well , we wanna small r remote control one side because  we want it to be cool and  designed , but  apparently  market shows that bigger s bigger  remotes get less lost , user interface: That I would believe . user interface: industrial designer: But  yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that .  so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the  direction of what is to yo the right of that slide  but without with a l a less complicated  design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access .  the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial . industrial designer: And  if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext . project manager: So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ? industrial designer: Ye no it's not user interface: That's not a scroll wheel . industrial designer: i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross , project manager: Nah . user interface: Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter . industrial designer: Yeah  yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized , so something looks good marketing: industrial designer: and  is not too prone to get lost . When I s when I see the when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it . There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . user interface: Are you talking about the picture ? That's not our that's not our b design , marketing: Yeah yeah . user interface: that's just a that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like . Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet . marketing: And  from from talking to Mike is that we have we have  we can market a more expensive product now . marketing: And and so yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what  w what is it that I'm gonna market ?  without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand .  I like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price right now . What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ? user interface: What's special and unique about a scroll ? marketing:  well I don't project manager: It's cool .  I say that it's different I what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . project manager: I'd I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , marketing: What i if when when we have project manager: but wi with a similar marketing: yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's as as a marketing standard I need something to market , to make this product unique . user interface: Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having  the  the actual design of the  case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , marketing: Yep . Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here . marketing: And and so so  yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now .   my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . That's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase . industrial designer: marketing: And so  we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . Yeah  again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet . project manager: So now marketing: If you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost . project manager: So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? Do we go basic or do we go for features ?  d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? user interface: Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? Function-wise , what does that do that project manager: Oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ? marketing: Yeah wh wh what's the wh user interface: Yeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . project manager:  'kay industrial designer: But would we marketing: Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . marketing: If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it  a marketing necessity . But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's a very competitive market . project manager: What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make . project manager: So I d user interface: Th they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , it  it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some  you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but  I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . user interface: No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but project manager: Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the  the case the the  dock to put it in to to charge it . project manager: And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often . I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , user interface: Yeah . marketing: and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness . project manager: So our big decision then is like how do we do  like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have  What type of casing ? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . project manager: user interface: I'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside . Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for user interface: Well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens I think are are kind of project manager: Okay . So then if we d d do we want to do anything more basic with the  more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for  buttons , or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? Do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ? industrial designer: It's only a T_V_ . user interface: Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing  it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there . user interface: So I I don't see any reason for having an L_C_D_ 'cause it's an increased cost . Yeah right now there's right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the , user interface: Right . project manager: Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing . marketing: project manager: So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and  project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ? marketing: project manager: What what overall things have we not decided on ? user interface: Well we have to I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . There's the scroll wheel , in or out ? What do you guys like in the user interface ? project manager: I think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ? marketing: Again . Well I think it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . It's just another it's just a an idea , and I don't know user interface: Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because I think , as far as durability th it's not a big well maybe when it's closed . marketing:  what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . marketing: And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . project manager: Yeah and I guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? marketing: Oh okay project manager: Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , user interface: Well marketing: if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost . user interface: The The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will marketing: project manager: That's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ? user interface:  we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine . marketing: So it's just  I I think that's user interface: It should be a really simple signal though so marketing: I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a  have a button I can push to find my remote control . project manager: And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep . project manager: But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? It's user interface: Oh yeah yeah . marketing: Or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink . project manager: marketing: You can industrial designer: Maybe not marketing: project manager: Makes your living room more fresh as you watch . I think that  user interface: So the scroll wheel , in or out ? project manager:  pr my personal preference is out . I don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used . Yeah I think we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , project manager:  . marketing: user interface: I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . project manager: But then that that surely d depends a little on the T_V_ marketing: W project manager: because some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so user interface: Sure . project manager: if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to to change channels . project manager: You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to user interface: Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain project manager:  . That's where you user interface: That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . marketing: user interface: It's just it's basically it it's just a f look and feel thing . marketing: I I think there's you know that  there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . project manager: Yeah if you're just sitting there going marketing: Instead of going button-to-bu you just j you'd j j j j j j . user interface: Now just just so you know though  you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . user interface: But project manager: You could basically make it so that it'll  it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . user interface: Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , project manager: Other than click click click . user interface: but I think once people get used to it I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though . project manager: And if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well , yeah , presumably . marketing: Now the the only thing I I on the interface side of it , is that I I I see the dilemma . But if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . marketing: So I can go  presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . So I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . marketing: So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? You understand what I'm saying ? user interface: I think I know what you might be getting at , or or project manager: Oh I see so if maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ? And then it that basically marketing: Oh no we could read it from the television . user interface: Well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , project manager:  . user interface: and it c it project manager: You'd need a display on the th the thing . user interface: Why ? It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ . You say programme start , and then type in marketing: Put user interface: 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually . user interface: So programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end . project manager: and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . project manager: That's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . user interface: Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two . marketing: Or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other . project manager: Yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they marketing: Ah-ha okay . user interface: I think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch , but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator project manager: Just the lights behind the buttons . user interface: to which , an L_E_ an L_E_D_ project manager: You could have back-lit buttons maybe . And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . Just so you know I think  it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . project manager: Yeah well we don't have it's not that we have more money , marketing: Didn't you say so ? project manager: we can push up the the price . marketing: So I don't know I don't know whether having user interface: I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ? marketing: Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit . project manager: Yeah no I I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . project manager: so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to marketing: Okay I'm I'm okay with that . I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level . project manager: But th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ? user interface: Well y yeah . Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for marketing: We have to find cost . user interface: with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote , how much would you pay for that ? project manager: But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market . project manager: I'm a student , but on the other hand I would think ,  with my Project Manager salary , I would think yeah I could probably afford this user interface: If industrial designer: user interface: Then you could probably afford this . If I had a cool new T_V_ and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which I think's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . I do I don't think I'd go over a hundred Euro certainly , that would be way too much , user interface: Oh no no . project manager: but the I would be happy paying over forty for it , I guess , but not much user interface: I would say thirty five to forty . marketing: Because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television . industrial designer: Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator . The next meeting starts in thirty minutes , although does it ? It starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . marketing: Well I have Is my three twenty one is the next meeting ? project manager: The the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah . project manager: Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ? user interface: I don't think so <doc-sep>project manager: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: - So , ready ? user interface: 'Kay marketing: No not really Just project manager: marketing: Crap . user interface: marketing: 'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ? project manager: So , we are user interface: Where ? marketing: user interface: It's here . project manager: So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have  first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , user interface: Okay . project manager: So we'll have to evaluate the  your proposed remote control , user interface: 'Kay . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of  building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the  production . industrial designer: project manager: So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their user interface: I have slides . project manager: user interface: It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . project manager: Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but user interface: Next a mo marketing: Yeah . In the traditional key  traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel .  this sta  this triangle base is very stable , so  so it's it's  it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v  , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so project manager: Everything's mushroom . industrial designer: Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have  you know  like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d user interface: Yeah project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . project manager: industrial designer: I don't think I hope nobody will eat it You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in project manager: Oh . Inspira inspiration is industrial designer: And inspired colour project manager: industrial designer: and and very sophisticated material , so . project manager: industrial designer: So what we w what I can add is that , you know he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: it is a low level chip , and user interface: So we cut it to see . industrial designer: You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i user interface: Okay . Here ? project manager: And where is the solar solar cell ? user interface: marketing: But we say  we sa we said solar . project manager: Where is the solar cell ? industrial designer: In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and project manager: Oh . Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price ? user interface: Okay marketing: industrial designer: I don't think so , project manager: Okay , we'll see after . So project manager: so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about  project manager: industrial designer: marketing: we had three keys key points to  for this remote control design , user interface: marketing: and first one was  project manager: marketing: So w we'll try to judge this feature  with a one to seven scale , one being  no , I think . marketing: Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? user interface: Yeah , I think so . user interface: Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour marketing:  I'll agree it's unique , but is it really industrial designer: Is it really fancy ? user interface: So it depend on how d do you define fancy . user interface: industrial designer: But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing . user interface: project manager: Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that industrial designer: Do Don't do that , please . marketing: I dunno where the lemon is , but industrial designer: I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so user interface: marketing:  it's not obvious . user interface: marketing: If industrial designer: Because i marketing: I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or project manager: Yeah . project manager: And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: What's the use for that ? industrial designer: I have no idea , so . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . project manager: industrial designer: I have no idea what project manager: And where is the voice recognition ? marketing: Okay . user interface: This is microphone array marketing: First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . Is it better like that ? marketing:  project manager: Looks okay , industrial designer: So we can we can say t user interface: project manager: let's say it's a pineapple now . industrial designer: The colour , is the colour acceptable ? marketing: No , the colour is okay , that's fine . marketing:  it's project manager: It looks like a marketing: but I would say there is more too much red . industrial designer: It's too much red ? marketing:  if industrial designer: In the basement ? project manager: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . So , from one to seven ? industrial designer: I will give I will project manager:   Seven is the ma the maximum ? industrial designer: I'll gi marketing: No , seven is false and one is true . marketing: Then  let me industrial designer: What other marketing: The other criterion is is it technologically  technologically in innovative . industrial designer: Is it easy to use ? project manager: Feasible ? You said previously that you there's  microphone inside an industrial designer: Ye  Embedded . project manager: and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? user interface: Yeah , yeah . project manager: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? user interface: So you can capture voice yeah , you c industrial designer: Oh yeah , yeah . industrial designer: And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is I marketing: Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more  I dunno , in the core , or single . industrial designer: I think technically it's acceptable , so project manager: Maybe two ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So using the same scale , two ? project manager: Two ? I would say two industrial designer: Two , yeah , two . project manager: It's better like that , isn't it ? user interface: marketing: Now maybe the most critical one . industrial designer: Most marketing: L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ? industrial designer: Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . marketing: Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the project manager: industrial designer: As a principle . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? user interface: You just tu turn d d industrial designer: I think maybe if you he project manager: Oh , ok I understand . marketing: Like if you want to go from user interface: project manager: You take take the remote , so industrial designer: If you hear some click project manager: and you can turn like that to change the channel ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah but imagine you y project manager: I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . user interface: marketing: Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's difficult . marketing: How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? user interface: No , no , no . industrial designer: Yeah but y how you need to know I marketing: But  if you're fro from two ? user interface: I if if this is a channel one . industrial designer: And you you can marketing: Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels  project manager: Oh yeah . user interface: So you got how many degree you you it project manager: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go industrial designer: I think you can if you have a scale , so user interface: No no , you don't have to y no it's  when you when you stop t  when you stop , the the turn , project manager: How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? user interface: It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the marketing: So you you count one degree , two degrees , no . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so marketing: Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main user interface: There's  also a number , you know . project manager: Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . project manager: But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . project manager: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: And but I'd user interface: And also you can , if you i project manager: yeah , what's what's this cherry ? user interface: You ca you can turn this . industrial designer: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates user interface: This is from one channel to industrial designer: maybe one of the user interface: Yeah . project manager: marketing: Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas industrial designer: project manager: Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control . industrial designer: Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . marketing: So reasonably , is four , is one ? industrial designer: Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . user interface: project manager: And what's your opinion ? industrial designer: Will you give four ? marketing:  we wouldn't say , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . industrial designer: Five ? Yeah , so maybe if user interface:  w w what do y what  you compare with traditional   tr traditional controller ? marketing: Yeah . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . industrial designer: Yeah but y you know user interface: There's two kind of balls , marketing: So you have user interface: the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . user interface: But in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ? marketing:  by pushing zero after after the first one . user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: And that's user interface: yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . user interface: Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . project manager: Previously you said that turning this was the fine marketing: Yeah , if you're changing your mind . user interface:  there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc marketing: Okay . marketing: Yeah but then  when you turn turn it project manager: Oh user interface: project manager: Yeah , no no , no . You know tha that's the weak point , user interface: You use your y marketing: because with a traditional one you just have one hand . project manager: Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . project manager: industrial designer: it's the next prototype , maybe we cou user interface: Okay okay , okay . project manager: marketing: Okay , so industrial designer: It need maybe some wo further work , but it's marketing: Yeah , especially on the easy to use industrial designer: Yeah ,  s yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , b I think project manager: But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . project manager: And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . project manager: So , just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet , so industrial designer: project manager: so it has the energy source . project manager: Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , industrial designer: No , project manager: but we have solar cells . project manager: how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or such as as number of branches ? industrial designer:  I think in each ball you have three project manager: Three ? industrial designer: three  yeah , three , yeah . Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? industrial designer: S s simple , simple , yeah . industrial designer: Is it marketing: industrial designer: Is sh it marketing: So we are all already nineteen . project manager: Okay , user interface: project manager: just keep on going , just to have an idea . industrial designer: Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's project manager: Well  industrial designer: There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . project manager: yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . project manager:  wood ? industrial designer: But it's yeah , a a rubber  marketing: Rather four buttons . industrial designer: Y you tu you turn you turn it , so user interface: No no no , it Okay . project manager: Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . project manager: I think we s if we keep on adding things industrial designer: It's okay . project manager: so we have to marketing: Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . project manager: Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? marketing: Yeah . marketing: just imagine we have industrial designer: So user interface: We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think . project manager: no ? marketing: Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really user interface: Yeah it's the one it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Because  it seems that this can be marketing: Yeah , if project manager: Or it would be better . project manager: So , do we need special colour ? marketing: Yeah , that's one of the requirement . user interface: We we can we can we c marketing: We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . project manager: I think so we need if we try to have a kind of industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , one . project manager: So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's  industrial designer: One . I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah . marketing: Okay , so what's the bottleneck ? user interface: How about we change the sale ? marketing: Double curved . user interface: marketing:  project manager: I think there's a problem with the push push button . project manager: So yeah , you will have marketing: So we have one button , industrial designer: One s one scroll wheel , so marketing: one wheel . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is user interface: Cou could we have look project manager: twelve fifty e user interface: Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? marketing: Yeah y actually it's wrong . user interface: Wha what industrial designer: It's fine , twelve fifty  user interface: yeah . industrial designer: The solar cells , r is i is it ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's not t t project manager: I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be industrial designer: Yeah , to be able to si to sell it . marketing: That's nice argument , industrial designer: Yeah , with mi marketing: but if it's it's still four our of twelve . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . industrial designer: We've done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so . project manager: Now industrial designer: So So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? project manager: So marketing: Well I think we have just have to discuss if industrial designer: Okay , okay , it's fine . project manager: Yeah ? Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , it's  it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end . project manager: And for the marketing guy ? marketing:  tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . project manager: And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and  and yellow . I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . user interface: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: It can be an interesting I don't know project manager: Yes , just lemon . user interface: Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's  industrial designer: It's flat ,  user interface: Yeah yeah it's flat , project manager: Squared ? user interface: yeah the shape is very boring . user interface: Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So you can you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can marketing: project manager: Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . industrial designer: But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . marketing: If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for industrial designer: We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . industrial designer: Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep user interface: marketing: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , you can keep the global appearan project manager: Yeah , and following industrial designer: The mood of persons , the fashions  project manager:  . project manager: It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of  T_V_ with  a a tr industrial designer: We int Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's user interface: Yeah . project manager: So user interface: marketing: industrial designer: project manager: do you think you can celebrate your creation ? user interface: And you can celebrate your leadership . marketing: Yeah , I think it's project manager: It's maybe a little bit expensive . industrial designer: Wh really ? project manager: industrial designer: It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so project manager: But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . industrial designer: I p is th y project manager: Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more is most important , industrial designer: the the yellow ball thing that marketing:  project manager: because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . industrial designer:  f like y we can we can put some  double R_ project manager: Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . project manager: So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . project manager: So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , user interface: So we have to give a project manager: so we have the slogan too . project manager: Yeah industrial designer: project manager: th no , it's the it's the pineapple control remote control . industrial designer: Oh unid  unidentified remote control , so marketing: It's more appropriate , somehow . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage user interface: Okay . Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ industrial designer: Yeah I always lose my Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be user interface: so you need to buy one . project manager: One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the  the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on  in your jacket . industrial designer: it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so . user interface: project manager: I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . No ? project manager: So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>project manager: So  I will again do the secretary part  we will have three presentation first   the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . project manager:   we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . project manager: So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the  first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use  what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And at the end  Sammy will give  a trend watching on what he's he's been doing . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or  and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ marketing: Ah . industrial designer: and then  titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . So , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . Still we are looking for possible  technical  specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic  to have enough energy with the solar cells marketing: And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . user interface: Why ? industrial designer:  it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser  re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ marketing: industrial designer: which are  which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , user interface: industrial designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition marketing: industrial designer: we want to reduce  cost . project manager:  I want to know why it b  just  sorry but for the point before  why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . industrial designer:   And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things project manager: Okay . user interface: W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like industrial designer: Yeah . marketing:  like this ? project manager: Yes so  user interface: to make it feel better and to you know industrial designer: Like in cell phones recently project manager: -huh . industrial designer: And this push buttons project manager:  yeah so industrial designer: we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo  we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money project manager: Okay , s so simple button and  speech recognition for the more complicated . industrial designer: for S S marketing: Speech industrial designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , user interface: user interface: Okay , and still we have industrial designer: so user interface:  can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? marketing: L_C_D_ . industrial designer:  l marketing: Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button . industrial designer: So  user interface: No , industrial designer: it's like a user interface: it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . industrial designer: Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and user interface: Okay , so let's try it , let's t industrial designer: because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display marketing: The L_C_D_ would industrial designer: or this inter marketing: The display would only be display and not  touch sensitive you mean . user interface: Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad ,  just a display for giving you information . Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries marketing: Okay . marketing: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just  the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask . industrial designer: Yeah , that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to   how to define our re speech recognition marketing: If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology project manager: Okay , industrial designer: and so project manager: for the location . industrial designer: Yeah , if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . So let's now go to the you don't have more question ? industrial designer: marketing: No , it's okay . user interface: But still  L_S_D_'s already quite nice , marketing: L_C_D_ . user interface: L_C_ marketing: L_S_D_ is something else , industrial designer: marketing: and it's quite nice as well . user interface:    have a look at this project manager: industrial designer: user interface: no it's yeah . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and  all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons marketing: user interface: and  we got explanation for every button industrial designer: user interface: and you can use your time and  it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and  the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and  go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and  power on and off  I I don't remember project manager:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: so  it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no ? I can see nothing . industrial designer: user interface: And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . marketing: Do you think it can come in several colours ? user interface: And everyone's gonna be satisfied . marketing: Or did the user interface: I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . marketing: Yeah , well they like  something which is  user interface: Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . marketing:  yeah , okay , user interface: Do you like it ? marketing: so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone , project manager: industrial designer: But it's  marketing: but I don't use that but again ,  I might user interface: That's why you don't have it . marketing: bu but project manager: industrial designer: But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ . industrial designer: Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this  the shapes and they can have different assembly . industrial designer: So users have different  they have their own interests , colour interests and so project manager: So ? user interface: project manager: you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_ , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Okay , what  there's one more decisi  one more solution in fact ,  'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , industrial designer: Lights , yeah . project manager: But  it can be in  maybe in an a gradable version , user interface: - , - , project manager: but industrial designer: Yeah . Those for which the remote control is  is to be  something useful  I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that  is  specific to them so it it's like a signature . project manager: Okay marketing: project manager: and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of  o or this is industrial designer: marketing: I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . project manager: so i it's not  a s base service industrial designer:  marketing: No  no . industrial designer: But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can those marketing: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . project manager: maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . user interface: Anyone has their remote controls here ? marketing: Oh , you don't ? Yeah . You don't have your remo user interface: No ? industrial designer: marketing: Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . marketing: It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like user interface: Okay . marketing: just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . Hand light , marketing:  glow in the dark , industrial designer: project manager: user interface: yeah . industrial designer: Yeah marketing: so industrial designer: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something marketing: user interface: user interface: but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? project manager: user interface: And  industrial designer: user interface: I dunno marketing: user interface: that's a question to you and to  to marketing: Well so I heard that  it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done  so that's the smartness of the thing . marketing: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or  beer cans with speech recognition industrial designer: marketing: but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . Are are you saying here that  the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want . industrial designer:  that  that could be feasible I guess , like So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition  so we can use marketing: Okay . marketing: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other   particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of  channels you are u more often using and  levels of volumes that you're more often  things like that industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: but industrial designer:  it's marketing: that might also be a good sales pitch again . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and  I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so  simple you might think that it's easy but  it's not so simple . Anyway these days  the best  source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at  what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day  or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . This is more risky because you're not following the trend , project manager: marketing: you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business .  to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but  basically there are  in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , industrial designer: marketing: it has to be new with some of  new  technology inside and  and this is also  more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see  it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of   that i  they can be id identified with  and and then  something that  contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . If we look back and not  look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have  a fruit and vegetable  way of of look or feel project manager: industrial designer: marketing: or so . And  if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , industrial designer:  . Well project manager: industrial designer: Yeah marketing: this so so I think   i industrial designer: kind of  maybe marketing: When we were talking about rubber , industrial designer: Yeah it marketing: I think  the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . marketing: So project manager: It seems to be marketing: Think more of  something in the colours of  like fruit and vegetables and spongy , industrial designer: Fruit . Even shape ? marketing: as a even in the shape it has to be more round and  more   look natural somehow . marketing: So that's what people seem to yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought project manager: Sorry . industrial designer: marketing: but that's that's fashion and project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Okay . project manager:  you have questions ? industrial designer: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it's marketing: These I'm sorry . industrial designer: This you you so did you marketing: Yeah , yeah we have people   listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , industrial designer: Where ? Oh . marketing: as you know our company is quite big and  so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask  their  friends industrial designer: It's not from  . marketing: The what we industrial designer: Yeah but some materials n they're to be  they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy marketing: Sure . marketing: We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables industrial designer: yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's marketing: but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course . We can have t colours or this shape marketing: Yeah , I think in the colours and in the  the kind of material . industrial designer: or at least marketing: If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good .  now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama  wil design , industrial designer: Look and feel de project manager:  Mark the user interface design , and  Sammy  the product evaluation . industrial designer: So , can we highlight the specific features of our project manager: Yeah you're right , you have to industrial designer: yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , project manager: So industrial designer: that's project manager: you say s industrial designer: we want to follow general trend . industrial designer: So , do you think marketing: No , we don't have to , user interface: So we have to  for project manager: No . marketing: industrial designer: So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like They more want these fancy features marketing:  I think i industrial designer: like marketing: yeah i it's again in this  what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us project manager: Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy  fruity-like marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer:  yeah at least like we can make banana or project manager: Don't you say that you cannot do double shape  curved shape user interface: But Doub double-curved . industrial designer: and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive user interface: Okay , okay . industrial designer: we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or user interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or project manager:  I think it's what we say , that we have an  an L_C_D_ with  information . marketing: The thing is that  if we want to have as he says if we want to have  a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . industrial designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: yeah yeah j yeah , marketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent  the wheel . marketing: Anyway it's very in general I think people  change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control "

        "Query": "What were the group's thoughts on the safety design, kinetic battery idea, wood case, and shape of the remote control during their discussion on the design and concept decisions?",
        "Summary": "The team reached a consensus that the remote control should have a waterproof design and be baby-proof to prevent any accidents. It was also agreed that the remote should have voice control functionality for children who may not be tall enough to operate it manually. Additionally, a child lock feature was deemed necessary. The group acknowledged the benefits of using a kinetic battery, but cost and reliability were concerns compared to a regular battery. They suggested using a cheaper chip to balance out the cost of the kinetic battery technology. The User Interface team expressed difficulty in keeping the remote small with a wood case, as the Industrial Designer believed it would be prone to breakage. The Project Manager proposed using rubber or plastic instead, considering practicality and ease of cleaning. The idea of creating fruit or vegetable-shaped remotes was discussed, with the understanding that only the exterior shape would change while the PCB remained the same. The team also considered offering customers customizable skins.",
        "Article": "Anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to .  and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching . industrial designer: so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation , project manager: You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay . marketing: industrial designer: okay , so basically I'll start off by  I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start   rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that  are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that . industrial designer: Okay , so  I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control project manager: Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , project manager: This basically sends information to a tr  transistor here , which then  sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , project manager: industrial designer:  everything else is kind of Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and  project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: on pressing this button I a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . So  the important point that I read over the website was  that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards  are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , project manager: industrial designer: so w we can have a configuration  irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . industrial designer: So they can be simple which is like  the normal batteries in  our  the cells , yeah ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer:  thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . industrial designer: So  I don't know if even if you want to consider this , user interface: industrial designer: but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll project manager: Okay . industrial designer: since  they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas  cheaper ,  all these options . marketing: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ . project manager: And charging their remote , marketing: Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just project manager: yeah . project manager: user interface: So what was what was this k ka industrial designer: The the kinetic energy one is  that e   they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . industrial designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . industrial designer: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it  re recharges or something . Okay  so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from  everybody's perspective . They can be basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with  one-sided curved and one side flat , project manager: industrial designer: These are the three options , right ?  user interface:  you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever user interface: industrial designer:  there were different kind of supplements available ,  like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? project manager: industrial designer: so  we can use even  a certain titanium is also used  in the company to make   some space design equipment , so it's kind of   it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but  it cannot be used on a double curved surface . So we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . industrial designer: So , and they have they can even have an an integrated  push-button inside the scrolling thing . So this is something that has been recently developed by the company ,  in the last decade , so not too recent . industrial designer: The various electronic options are   so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at  so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? The P_C_B_ is  inexpensive , so we can put put in  whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one project manager: industrial designer:  okay , so the good thing about  wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip .  besides this in electr under electronics  also the company has started making a sample sender , which is did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that  so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . So I'm guessing that  the sample speaker is probably something like   you know , as soon as you press a button , it it   give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . industrial designer:  and  I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . Okay , so th that's that's basically now now  I think that  we can integrate   you know ,  the user interface  and  the marketing things in that , keep  taking out things from this and  underlining things that are important , yeah . project manager: What are you , PowerPoint , or user interface:  I have some PowerPoint , yeah . marketing: project manager: Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? user interface: 'Kay . project manager: Some sort of radiation ? industrial designer: marketing: No it's got its little camera in there , plug it in .  to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk  this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . user interface: So  yeah , this time  I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again . So  I thought  I would also include the definition of user interface  so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen  by the user  and and which  the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and  voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on . user interface:   the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then  analyse them  from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also  whether their appearance was was pleasant . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually  hard to find the ones you you really  want to use and  and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . project manager: user interface:  well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , project manager: user interface: sorry for that . Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least  with the smallest number of buttons as well . Okay , there is a we can  include voice recognition and  it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . And  our own manufacturing division ha has  designed a new   programmable speech   sorry  speaker unit I guess it's it should be . user interface:  and this means that  once   it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's once once the   gadget  recognises  the voice of the speaker , there can be a  pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . user interface: So  this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . industrial designer:  sorry ,  can you go back for a second ?   are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ?  oh yeah are th project manager: It's like the like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel . marketing: Yeah , you can't user interface: No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like  it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . user interface: But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , marketing: G yeah , no , you can . user interface: it's like you press this or this or industrial designer:  it's the iPod  kind of  marketing: It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round project manager: -huh . marketing: I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , project manager: marketing: Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , project manager: Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard  major buttons like on , off ,  ch the channels and and then  volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen .  and I I also thought  if we want to keep it small and nice  and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it  like on a  i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is  I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control . marketing: Okay , I've put the copy of the presentation in  the project manager: The project documents .  so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . marketing: you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . industrial designer: So   maybe  as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just  keep highlighting things here ? marketing: So project manager: Yeah , yeah , sure . So   so it project manager: That's over on the interface , industrial designer: yeah , project manager: if if you could put industrial designer: so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer:  and an project manager: And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning industrial designer: yeah . Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , project manager: so that means we need an advanced thing . W  L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , project manager: industrial designer: and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? marketing: Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ?  we've got one of those  Telewest boxes industrial designer:  . marketing: and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain , project manager:  . marketing: so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . project manager: It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , marketing: You know ? Yeah . project manager: so if you're watching something industrial designer: That's true , yeah , that's also marketing: And i it would be like  if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than project manager: Yeah . marketing: But  I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched . marketing: So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . marketing: So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that industrial designer:  right . marketing: and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , project manager: And then you can flip it open . industrial designer: So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and project manager: Yeah , I think so . marketing: But that would be a good way to to get in the whole  R_S_I_ issue in there , industrial designer: Right . marketing: because  if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands project manager: marketing: so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand .  project manager: Something a bit squishy and marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , we we have marketing: but  y you have to user interface: So it could be like a rubbery industrial designer: we have rubber , user interface: yeah , -huh . industrial designer: but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the  with using marketing: Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote  an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . project manager: Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well . industrial designer: So if if we use  latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , project manager: -huh . industrial designer: so  we could use titanium , wood or plastic  or  project manager: Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other  power things . marketing: If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , project manager: From from bouncing it . industrial designer: Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . marketing: It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically . Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? project manager: -huh . industrial designer: It  marketing: No , I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . I I have one of those s slidey phones and  the back is essentially straight , project manager:  . industrial designer:  I think  project manager: Yeah , 'cause the marketing: Besides , you have four sides to a thing , so  does curved one side mean one side is straight project manager: Yeah . marketing: and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ? industrial designer: Right . industrial designer: because  according to the information that I have , I think  the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . industrial designer: It does not say anything about  whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all .  it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . marketing: But no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , industrial designer: marketing: 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . project manager: Anything else ? What've we got ? marketing:  combine style with a level of functionality ,  beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function . marketing: Okay ? user interface: Thanks project manager: Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . Let's let's try to r rub off things and project manager: Yeah , rub off some of those . industrial designer: yeah , so  user interface: industrial designer: hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? You you got a wind dynamo , yeah . project manager: it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having a having a wind up .  kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of   appeal , project manager: I think tha industrial designer: but  it's marketing: It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ? industrial designer: Yeah . As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , marketing:  if industrial designer: this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . industrial designer: Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that , project manager: Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it . Okay , let's keep it option  keep an option , project manager: I'd I'd keep it on .  the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah . project manager: We don't want that user interface: Yeah project manager: it's no it's not not vegetable . Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? project manager: user interface: N wood is I can't n how do you   you can't keep it really small  industrial designer:  . Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so  if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky industrial designer: Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break , user interface: wi - yeah . project manager: Yeah , and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more user interface: Yeah . marketing: It's it's not a practical  it's it's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know . industrial designer: Right , so  the the push-buttons is is our expertise  in the industry , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: but  it seems to be out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be marketing: You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ? user interface: Yeah , but you  I think for for the channel numb  channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ? project manager: user interface: Yeah , so for channel numbers but industrial designer: Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then  you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . user interface: But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah , it's faster project manager: Just for fast user interface: with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s  discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then  y you can use it as a normal remote control , marketing: industrial designer: Right . user interface: but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , marketing: user interface: but it's it it's more time-consuming . marketing: I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? Or do we have just  channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ? user interface: No , no ,   we we definitely need the the numbers , industrial designer: The numbers . project manager: Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: Or on the L_C_D_ we can , you know marketing: G yeah , user interface: Yeah , I would say buttons , marketing: I would think buttons , yeah . marketing: It's it's the industrial designer: So  marketing: I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , user interface: I project manager:  . marketing: and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , industrial designer: Alright . marketing:  there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there . industrial designer: Okay , so buttons definitely in but oh shall we  try to draw a prec  project manager: I think that's what you guys are gonna do next , industrial designer:  okay . industrial designer: Right , so  what about the the scrolling  ? user interface: Yeah but n I I'm not completely  completely clear  I yeah , about the spinning wheel . So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , marketing: E either or user interface: it's  you can al include everything in the spinning if you marketing: G yeah . user interface: yeah , yeah , marketing: I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , user interface: in that case . marketing: so you have to decide whether you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . But  the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . industrial designer:   project manager: But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . user interface: Ah , but  you can marketing: Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . industrial designer: I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber .  i it project manager: No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside . user interface: Yeah , I  I think so too ,  the case would be marketing: You want an outside of rubber user interface: yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons , marketing: and then open it up and industrial designer: Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . marketing: 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it industrial designer: Right , right . industrial designer: Right , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . Yeah , and  we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? project manager: And  colours can be provided with the case rather than  but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or project manager: user interface: Yeah I think we  it was a a requirement that we use our  th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or marketing: That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . marketing: Yeah , but  do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? So you could have like project manager: marketing:  I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and  maybe purple project manager: Green . marketing: and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it .  since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to project manager: We need the advanced yeah . industrial designer:  what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be  a definite yes , project manager: Yeah . marketing: So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or project manager: That was the industrial designer: Oh is oh the constraint was  marketing: If project manager: We can't have solar panels with rubber , so . project manager: Shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think  on as our case , and then user interface: industrial designer: we'll have   using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , a although it does seem  interesting .  okay , so r we understand this better now that  the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says  the things that you type in or something like that , so project manager: I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , industrial designer: Ye yeah , we we don't have too much information about it ,  project manager: but if it's Yeah . user interface: Yeah , but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah . project manager: It's from the company , so industrial designer: Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other . project manager: Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer ? marketing: Yeah , sure j project manager: Just so we can marketing: Sorry , do you want me to project manager: Nothing , it's right , I'm just There we go . marketing: What does  I_C_S_ mean ? industrial designer: I_C_s ?  integrated circuits . industrial designer:   we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s ,  . So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip industrial designer: Right . project manager: and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself ,  made out of rubber industrial designer: Yep . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . That's our overall concept , user interface:  project manager: and it's gonna look sort of vegetable , marketing: user interface: industrial designer: project manager: and be in bright vegetable colours . So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer marketing: Imagine it would be inside . marketing: so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . marketing:  so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the project manager: marketing: You've maybe got , you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , project manager: On the marketing: and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , project manager: In the centre , marketing: yeah . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , industrial designer:  the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . project manager: Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it . marketing: I've got a bit tangled up in all this user interface: So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with project manager: I dunno , maybe I would car user interface: we need to {disfmarker}<doc-sep> it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock .  okay our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations  and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different  functions of it . And s  in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials  and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . The case ,  the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do ,  there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic .  buttons , for buttons we have  pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , project manager:  . industrial designer: which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen .  circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are .  we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of  using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . Or a solar battery , although there are slight  complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . industrial designer: Or  something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you .  personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything project manager:  . industrial designer: any ideas on that ?  I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll  buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . project manager: industrial designer: But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down .  we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down .  I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . marketing: Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ? industrial designer: I'm not sure . marketing: 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve industrial designer: This is what I'm sort of marketing: and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , I wonder industrial designer: I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . But the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . project manager:  just a real quick question  the weight of these different elements , have you industrial designer: Yeah , n project manager: no idea , okay .  I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , project manager: industrial designer: and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , project manager: industrial designer:  but other than project manager: industrial designer: that's really basic , that's all I have gotten so far . industrial designer: I have save this in the  shared projects , if anyone wants to look project manager: Thank you , perfect . industrial designer: and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . project manager:  if you made notes yourself you can put those on our  underneath our oh ,  in your book , industrial designer: Just in my notebook , project manager: then don't worry about that . industrial designer: but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . Alright ?  I guess I can project manager: 'Kay now we're  concepts concepts of user interface . user interface: Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device .  we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . We have a number of different choices for a design concept  and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of  , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , industrial designer: user interface: how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device .  once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and  the extra functions and the more advanced features . industrial designer: user interface: So basically , marketing: user interface: that's what we don't want .  you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen .  you can just about make out  that the button three buttons are  previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time .  then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often .  most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored .  other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ ,  I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ .  you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow .  and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or  have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . user interface: And that would allow you to access access the advanced features  whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . industrial designer: So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? user interface: I think that's that's one way to go , yes . user interface:   there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . user interface: There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're I industrial designer: Right user interface: well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device .  it would also have to have  a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , project manager: user interface: but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control .  a bit like a bit like how they have these  digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up . project manager: I do think that  one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . project manager: like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's  you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . industrial designer: Well Are you are you tak project manager: Like I I know I use that often enough . marketing: Wait , but is that separate from what he was saying ? project manager: Well industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a industrial designer: No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , user interface: But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c  communication is one way , project manager: user interface: so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . marketing: Should I plug that in ? project manager: marketing: user interface: Is that going on ? Okay . marketing: Is it on ? Ri What F_ do you have to press , project manager: Eight . Basically , I was given  an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . project manager: marketing: So first  they had people they ranked  the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , industrial designer: Okay . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun ,  in a year , so user interface: marketing: even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . industrial designer: marketing: Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . user interface: industrial designer: That there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: that pretty much sums it up . marketing: Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ? project manager:  do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ?  how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or  or the spongy material at all ? user interface: project manager: Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? It would be easier on the hands . industrial designer: If it's latex if it's latexy project manager: It's kind of and then it industrial designer: mean project manager: we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , user interface: A kind of thing that project manager: I dunno . But industrial designer: An  I if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , project manager: industrial designer: but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . It's there's something to be said ,  we we got that thing earlier from you about  not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: Yeah , so something , m m instead of a necess industrial designer: something grippable ,  we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . marketing: yeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , user interface: Yeah . marketing: you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , industrial designer: marketing: like I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called . industrial designer: Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable . could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them , project manager: F for sure , or maybe like marketing: industrial designer: li project manager:  couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . project manager: Could they be smelly ? user interface: I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ?  like  I dunno , like  carrots or something . marketing: project manager: Or carrot shaped , industrial designer: it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot project manager:  . industrial designer: isn't it ? user interface: Maybe , project manager: Like large button , industrial designer: Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . marketing: What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . project manager: would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ? marketing: Just to tie it in a little . When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? Or your fingers ? marketing: Yeah . Maybe industrial designer: I user interface: Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb . project manager: Don't you think ? industrial designer: No marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: just thumb-sized . industrial designer: Jus project manager: But  in order to get to all of them , marketing: But I like i project manager: you know . user interface: But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps . I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . user interface: So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . user interface: and And you find that works quite well ? marketing: I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . user interface: Is that marketing: 'Cause th user interface: The button on an iPod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ? marketing: It's like five , project manager: It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel . industrial designer: yeah , it would  each version of it has been a little bit different , project manager: The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think . industrial designer: but Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . marketing: I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . marketing: Like just the idea of like those industrial designer:   marketing: so few buttons for main things , industrial designer: t marketing: but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . marketing: 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Yeah , I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ industrial designer: Right . industrial designer:  project manager: Okay  we have we've about fifteen minutes left , industrial designer: Oh we probably have to get going , don't we ? project manager: so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation .  I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all industrial designer: 'Kay .  industrial designer: Could Could we  could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , marketing: If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . project manager: Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex industrial designer: Exactly . user interface: I think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . user interface: So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside . marketing: Lemons ? industrial designer: user interface: project manager: Okay ,  marketing: project manager: components concept . project manager: G industrial designer: Right , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary but  project manager: That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . So can you just explain what that is real quick ? industrial designer: Alright , so  decisions , what the okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . industrial designer:  I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? project manager: I think it's awesome . user interface: Yeah ,  I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the  how reliable it is , industrial designer: Right , I haven't gotten any user interface: but as far as I know , the technology is good . industrial designer: yeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but  but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think . They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . project manager: industrial designer: I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done . But I don't know any decisions on marketing: project manager: If they're if they're really options . industrial designer: I did f user interface: Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think .  oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got .  , 'kay , the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? user interface:  I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . user interface:  but project manager: but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . 'Cause you don't have control over numbers user interface: I don't think it would really work . marketing: Yeah , it's a project manager: or industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . industrial designer: th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . marketing: But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be user interface: Yeah . marketing: and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . marketing: And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . project manager: So , have a scroll for volume ? industrial designer: F or for all those secret functions ? project manager: F industrial designer: When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . user interface: I think yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later . project manager: I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide  whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . industrial designer:  I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . project manager: I'm a little  I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . project manager:  marketing: Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ? industrial designer:  yeah , everything I've project manager: Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . industrial designer: N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's  like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . industrial designer: Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , project manager: Ge o industrial designer: I think that that's done for us . Okay  let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . industrial designer: Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ? project manager: Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ? marketing: I'm thinking curved of some sort . industrial designer: We don't really know what the difference project manager:  okay , interface , the type and the supplements . So push or scroll , user interface:  project manager: right ? Or both ? user interface: Yep .  And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . user interface: So in terms of  in terms of  economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . And if we had a sc an on-screen  kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno . I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case user interface: Yeah . project manager: Is that okay with you ? industrial designer: because project manager: How you feeling ? marketing: Yeah .  I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , project manager: marketing: but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . project manager: Okay , so we're gonna go with  type pushbuttons , and then supplements , user interface: Yep . project manager: how are we gonna do that ? user interface:  what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? project manager:  I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the  the additional buttons we can use . user interface:  project manager: So we're gonna have like a menu button , industrial designer: Oh . project manager: Okay ,  so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . user interface:  in industrial designer: So what are what are our buttons gonna be ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So like one through five , or user interface: Yeah , yeah marketing: Like a radio type sorta situation ? user interface: about yeah like yeah , a bit like radio presets .  project manager: Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need  numbers one through zero , right ? user interface:  we wouldn't even need the numbers . project manager: Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . user interface: and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , industrial designer: Yeah , up down .  our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , industrial designer: project manager:  you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . project manager:  did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ? industrial designer: Simple chip <doc-sep>industrial designer: project manager: So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . And  so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . industrial designer: You can  choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . industrial designer: You have on the  on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . user interface: industrial designer: And here the the switch that control if you want project manager: Why you why you you put it in the the side ? industrial designer: Well I I I think  it's the project manager: It's not a good place maybe . industrial designer: Yeah but user interface: No i i it's the all around camer  microphone isn't it . marketing: Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? industrial designer: Well so it's a microphone array . industrial designer: No user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's just a single microphone , and you I I think  we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to user interface:  . industrial designer: well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . industrial designer: And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker  recognition system to  to be on or off . project manager: How much does it cost this one ? industrial designer: Well this this prototype is  made for about  well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars user interface: For the project manager: Fifteen dollars ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: fifteen dollars , project manager: Ah it's above it's above the budget . industrial designer: but  well it's not it's not  yeah , but  it's just a prototype and if we  if we optimises the  the  voila . project manager: How many b battery is there ? industrial designer: How many , excuse me ? project manager: Battery . industrial designer: Well  f battery , we use  about  user interface: Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . industrial designer: Yeah and you just project manager: So one one battery ? industrial designer: On  yeah one battery . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: You just n  marketing: Now what is the whole day rating for that ? industrial designer: The excuse me ? marketing: Whole day's rating . user interface: marketing: What type of battery ? industrial designer: Oh yeah it's just a r  simple battery a rechargeable  user interface: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Then the next time you pick it , oh project manager: industrial designer: it works . user interface: I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button industrial designer: Yeah just explain the button  Norman . This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , industrial designer: user interface: you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . industrial designer: user interface: You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . marketing: And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah it's project manager: industrial designer: So we have the the second version also with the different  button configuration . marketing: industrial designer: So basically th it's the same  marketing: -huh and also the switch . user interface: marketing: And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , user interface: Oh no marketing: because that's a major that's a user interface: th actually th we'll come to that point in our industrial designer: Yeah it's it's it's embed in the  speech recognition system . marketing: Okay industrial designer: So marketing: and if you disable speech recognition system then ? user interface: W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . user interface: Th they either these with the  the the charger any project manager: With the remote control . project manager: Okay so the price of the charger included in the user interface:  it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price  . user interface: It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but  again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but project manager: The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Yeah project manager: Well that's so user interface: but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . project manager: We have we have just marketing: Yeah people are willing to pay more , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . project manager: And the price of production user interface: industrial designer: Alright please  go on Norman with the special features . marketing: Or  user interface: Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , marketing: user interface: so is  modular . user interface: Yeah yeah , project manager: user interface: for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , marketing: Something like customised . industrial designer: user interface: You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . industrial designer: You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control project manager: But user interface:  yeah yeah you should present that . industrial designer: that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control marketing: And this is other one ? user interface: industrial designer: i i if you  if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and  which channel you want to choose and so on . industrial designer: H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , marketing:     . industrial designer: they just plug in it user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and they can have all the control they want here . industrial designer: We also have this module for  old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , user interface:  . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the  the same powerful functionalities . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our  an innovation   i in this  design here . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here oop industrial designer: user interface: it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? industrial designer: The titanium project manager: Titanium . industrial designer: and so it's very  user interface: Again  and the battery life is  is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . user interface: Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then  y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ ,  and then there's this message coming out that  please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it marketing: Okay . Yeah and  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define marketing:     . user interface: so sorry ? project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: And then  because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . project manager: What what's user interface: Maybe we can improve more on the design but project manager: Maybe yeah . industrial designer: project manager: What's the price to p to produce ? user interface:  this is the industrial designer: Well so the price to produce For  the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . project manager: With with with the charge ? industrial designer:  it's about it The without without the charger marketing: With the charger ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's about  well two dollars to produce  the microphone and speech recognition systems . user interface: industrial designer: Two dollars for the  for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you  sum up  everything wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . industrial designer: so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about  fifteen dollars . project manager: No it's industrial designer: But it's just if you want all functionalities . user interface: marketing: Yeah it's a nice input project manager: We marketing: but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . project manager: marketing: I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu user interface: Yeah . user interface: marketing: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and  in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and  very handy to hold . user interface: marketing: Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . industrial designer: Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen   with just four buttons . marketing: Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . marketing: And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . user interface: But the the problem is that  is it robust to mishandling ? industrial designer: Okay . user interface: We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . user interface: marketing: So these are the f  three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . marketing: say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , user interface:  . marketing: so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So user interface: So marketing: We can make our study on this and user interface: so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? marketing: No no we have you have designed two products now , project manager: Yeah . user interface: But who will give the scoring  we ourself or or a third party ? project manager: You . marketing: According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it  with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? user interface:  . marketing: D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? industrial designer: Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . marketing: And you both agree for that ? project manager: And you ? user interface: I think we can improve on the design . It's it it project manager: user interface:  we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . marketing: So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: Yeah a three . marketing: So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? user interface: Yeah . I think it's it's  more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated marketing: Four . industrial designer: so removing the L_C_D_  gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . industrial designer: Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six . marketing: Five with L_C_D_ and user interface: industrial designer: Well five also  Norman please . user interface: Yeah project manager:  user interface: from the innovation aspect I feel that  what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that  the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because  that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've  A lot of functionalities . user interface: So that is  that is  for both th marketing: So without L_C_D_ ? user interface: Our gi I think that the our our product is  has the best in all well this is a biased judgement industrial designer: user interface: because we designed them . marketing: No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: And without L_C_D_ ? industrial designer:  for both it's the the same innovations . So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:    there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? marketing: So we can't go project manager: industrial designer: Talk about user interface: We haven't really  determined what are actually actually project manager: marketing:  that what you are sayin that's what the design user interface: it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: marketing: No it's like this , project manager: marketing:  on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . Yeah but industrial designer: Yeah project manager: But industrial designer: but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . marketing: No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . industrial designer: If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n marketing: L_C_D_ ? Then  there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . marketing: Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a user interface: But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . marketing:  that depends upon your design , so user interface: Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , marketing:  user interface: we give what the customer  wants , right . user interface: marketing: So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? user interface: industrial designer: Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and  well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product user interface: industrial designer: so I will give a six for the easy to use . user interface: Yeah I think project manager: No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . project manager: Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , marketing: Yeah . project manager: and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be user interface: Yeah . marketing: Or we can just go back to the previous slide  where we ha we have a few updates . S industrial designer: And  if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to  for the shape and  things like that so marketing: Yeah that's right . For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , marketing: Yeah yeah that's right .  we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but  what I'm trying to say here is that the  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . marketing: So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? project manager: user interface: W  marketing: Or you want it to be six ? user interface: I think it's the same . industrial designer: Yes as you say , with better  project manager: Without L_C_D_ . marketing: S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . marketing: As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so let's go back to our laboratory and user interface: To improve on the design . project manager: what about the integration of speech recognition ? user interface: Huh ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . industrial designer: It's optional yeah , since well according to this study  people more likes more to have a spongy  remote control than project manager: I think it will be I think i user interface: marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these  marketing: Yeah , but  if you have an add-ons , the kids may just  hide the parental module project manager: Yeah . project manager: Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , industrial designer: project manager: so mayb better if you have all this in the same marketing: In the same set , yeah , project manager: marketing: and and individual buttons to make them work . user interface: The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . I don't know , project manager: So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  will be optional . user interface: what do you think  ? Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . project manager:  marketing:  how to how to how to make a marketing survey that  how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ user interface: Yeah . But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? project manager: I think it inc increase . industrial designer: Oh no , project manager: industrial designer: because if you if you add  something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces  to to to build but project manager:  . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah user interface: industrial designer: it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities  on the same module , but  user interface:  . marketing: On the same P_C_B_ user interface: Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . industrial designer: user interface: We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m project manager: marketing: Updates and we sell it . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And  what's the idea about  the shape of the remote controls ? industrial designer: Well so marketing:  can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah marketing: Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and industrial designer: I think we are yeah but we are also the  well the components will have to change because  we have to deal with the shape and  but I don't think it will  increase the cost too much so user interface:  . marketing: Or  it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior  shape is different o for all . industrial designer:  well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to  ah well user interface: Yeah . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin marketing: Yeah , yeah that's right . industrial designer: and then  add on skins and with with this  tex spongy texture  things like that . project manager: So industrial designer: So we finished the prototype  presentation if you have  something else to say . user interface: marketing: I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . We have to give answers so marketing: user interface: I suppose that you this criteria , is it ? project manager: Project evaluation . This room is a bit small , but industrial designer: project manager: user interface: but I think it's okay for us to work with . marketing: I feel it's fine , we know we don't need  I think it's okay . marketing:   what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? user interface:  we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . industrial designer: Yeah and also more well  more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have  clear clear points whenever we do a meeting marketing: user interface:  . industrial designer:  prior to the meeting to have  well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . marketing: And the evaluation was project manager: Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . marketing: So project manager: Yeah free free coffee user interface: Alright then , we finished ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Yeah thank you for your work and marketing: Yeah thank you , thank you very much <doc-sep>We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project   remote control for the design for a new remote control . marketing: project manager: So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of  the next meeting . marketing: project manager:  I think the important points we have to t talk about are  it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . project manager: user interface: It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: And it's gonna be you'll try to guess . marketing: A r a rabbit , oh oh yeah , where is the carrot ? project manager: user interface: That's it . project manager: You want to go ? industrial designer: marketing: I am not very good at  this kind of stuff . industrial designer: marketing: My favourite animal is project manager: industrial designer: You wa marketing: user interface: Wow . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: What about you  project manager:  yeah Christa Pavlov  . project manager: So they have to be waterproof maybe ? marketing: It has to be  wha baby proof project manager: 'Cause they eat she ate it . marketing: because even if she's not very tall she's  high enough so that  when she throw it away it's  industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: But how gonna okay , just  but it's  monochrome it's n it's not like industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the  marketing: Oh like the phones , industrial designer: like the phones and these things we c yeah . project manager: Small also ? Don't you think industrial designer: Huh not so big like yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , not too much buttons and marketing: Should it be , y you know these  remote controls where  they are what they call a universal ret remote control project manager: marketing: so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator industrial designer:  . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: marketing: whatever project manager: that's marketing: I dunno if it's project manager: marketing: Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . marketing: So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , project manager: So , I think there's marketing: yeah , size matters , yeah . Colour , size , sh project manager: So you you think it's better if small than bigger . marketing: But  what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if industrial designer:  maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . marketing: I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place . marketing: For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , project manager:  . So , some kind of idea  with   cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what marketing: I dunno . marketing: Too expensive for twelve Euro ? user interface: And n maybe not too expensive , project manager: And too expensive . marketing: So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , industrial designer: Ye yeah . marketing: so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , industrial designer:  . industrial designer:  it it's like marketing: I don't know if it makes sense , but project manager: industrial designer: it's like two types no ? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this marketing: Yeah , for instance ,  . industrial designer:  user interface: so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? industrial designer: huh . user interface: On off ? industrial designer: Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can  only make one working . industrial designer: We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . user interface:  if it's less than three  then we can make it  like a industrial designer: Two . marketing: Three buttons you mean ? user interface: like three mental states , project manager: Three option . project manager: Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside industrial designer: project manager: that ask you three user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three  three button , three  possibilities , ye yeah . user interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . marketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . industrial designer: marketing: Because I'm only using three or four channels but industrial designer: Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash  this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit . I change channel like this , m  I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , -huh  yeah . marketing: And then back to the one I was before , project manager: Also we can be here marketing: so there's whichever it was . project manager: marketing: Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , industrial designer:  . marketing: that becomes more complex , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: but you could look at what  the other people have used there or remote controls . project manager:  we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and  I want you to  work on these ideas and try to make a  the ones , make  to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . marketing: So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's  that's for us ? user interface: Market Expert . user interface: marketing: Oh , of course yeah , the user requirement specifications , -huh , yeah "

        "Query": "What are the current thoughts on using XML tools and the status of transcription?",
        "Summary": "Summary:\nGrad H mentioned that they were working on standardizing data in XML format, but expressed dissatisfaction with the current format. They were also developing tools to extract information from XML files using Java and Perl. The transcriber pool has been meeting expectations in terms of work completed within the allocated time. Grad D explained the importance of combining different experts in the network to adapt to various situations, suggesting dividing the network into parts and allowing it to determine which experts to trust in each situation. The transcriber pool is making good progress and may be utilized for other coding tasks in the future, such as analyzing speaker overlap. They are also coding non-speech gestures like breaths and laughter to improve recognition results. The group reviewed transcription checking procedures and discussed coordinating data channelization and presegmentation with tighter time bins.",
        "Article": "But  we 're gonna try to make this an abbreviated meeting cuz the the next next occupants were pushing for it , so . Agenda is according to this , is transcription status , DARPA demos XML tools , disks , backups , et cetera and grad h: Does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ? professor b: OK . grad h:  phd d: I g grad h: as a somewhat segue into the next topic ,  could I get a hold of  the data even if it 's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ? postdoc a: Certainly . So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there . grad h:  and then just we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made . professor b: OK , wh phd d: I also got anot a short remark to the transcription . I 've  just processed the first five EDU meetings and they are chunked up so they would they probably can be sent to IBM whenever they want them . phd d: but the other ones phd f: That 's the one that we 're waiting to hear from them on . postdoc a: These are separate from the ones that phd f: As soon as postdoc a: these are phd f: They 're the IBM set . And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK grad h: Is my mike on ? Yeah . phd f: and we get the transcript back and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , then  we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch , postdoc a: Excellent . grad h: And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ? phd f: Yes , exactly . phd f: We 're sort of doing things in parallel , that way we can get as much done a at once . grad h: Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it , phd f: Yeah . grad h: Right , which  So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , so the front - end is the user interface and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for  conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it , do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting , phd f: What what kind of  what does that look like ? The string that you type in . phd f: What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ? grad h: Keywords . grad h: Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything . professor b: And then does it play something back or that 's something you 're having to program ? grad h: right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools , professor b: Yeah . grad h: but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? We have two tools that have already been written . grad h:  the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: I Can I ask a question ? So  as it stands within the the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play . So e Are you So you 're adding like  , I don't know ,  are they fuzzy matches or are they  ? grad h: It 's a sort of standard , text - retrieval - based So it 's  term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring . grad h:  and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that . So it it 's postdoc a: It 's a lot more sophisticated than the  the basically Windows - based grad h: i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that . grad h: So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents . Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search . grad h:  you have to do preindexing and so that these tools do all that . And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it well  to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings . grad h: So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that . phd f: So what does the user see as the result of the query ? grad h: On which tool ? phd f: THISL . grad h: The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK phd f: Yeah . grad h:  you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits and you can type on them and listen to them . professor b: Mmm phd f: So if you typed in \" small heads \" or something you could grad h: Right , you 'd get phd f: get back a   something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred grad h: something You you 'd get to listen to \" beep \" . It 's too bad that that couldn't come into the grad h: You couldn't get a video . phd g: Guess who I practice on ? postdoc a: At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , that keeps coming up . Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable  demo sort of format . grad h: And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally phd f: That sounds really neat . grad h: and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .  Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I 'll work with him on it . And it it 's looking pretty good , you know , the fact that I got the query system working . grad h: If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's  , I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . phd f: But you were saying that that the  that there 's that set of tools , Cygnus tools , that grad h: So . grad h: But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer , professor b:   phd f: And you have to have all the o grad h: But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't and  different compiler work - arounds and so on . So the fact that  it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows . professor b: How about having it run under free BSD ? phd e: Well what you need grad h: Free BSD would probably be easier . phd e: All you need to do is say to Dan \" gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf \" and it 'll be done in a day . phd d:  phd e: Right ? grad h: Actually you know I should check because he did port it to SPRACHcore phd e: Right . professor b: So grad h: I 'll check at that professor b: But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . phd e: What I phd f: How does it play ? grad h: Yeah , right . professor b: If he has then you learn , if he hasn't then he 'll do it . So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with   , SoftSound guy ,  postdoc a: It 's amazing . professor b: Tony Robinson ? phd f: Tony Robinson ? grad h: Do  Tony ? I guess I do . grad h: Which one do  ? phd e: Steve Renals is not SoftSound , is he ? professor b: No . grad h: so that 's all going pretty well , professor b: Assuming we 're phd e: Right . phd f: What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ? grad h: I think we 'll be OK with that . phd e: Why don't you try and merge Transcriber and THISL IR ? They 're both Tcl interfaces . grad h: Well this is one of the reasons This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have  Dave Gelbart Gelbart Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff phd e: Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality and it 's grad h: Yeah , yeah , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack . Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts  eh you know , from speaker to speaker . grad h: And if it doesn't phd e: Right ? Do you have you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ? grad h: Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so . It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about and having the search tools and so on . grad h: but professor b: The thing I was asking about with , free BSD is that it might be easier to get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in grad h: Yeah ,  we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments , professor b: Yeah . grad h: so   My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . grad h: It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the \" include \" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different . grad h: So I it might be a little easier but it 's not gonna be a lot easier . So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , then we talked about  some other stuff which would basically be  showing off the the Transcriber interface itself and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , but but  ,  and part of that was showing off what the speech - non  nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like . postdoc a: Can I ask one more thing about THISL ? So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized  ? grad h:   phd g: So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody  work that Don 's been doing . phd g:  actually show some of the features and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries . professor b: Well I think at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that phd g: I don't know if that would be of interest or not . professor b: cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point phd g: Yeah . professor b: pointing at something I don't know much about , phd g: you 're looking at this now professor b: so . phd g: Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ? grad c:  yeah I 'm starting to and  Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on . phd g: Yeah def professor b: S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month phd g: I professor b: and then that 'll give us a week or so . The end of phd g: Oh , the end of this month or next month ? Oh , you mean like today ? grad h: This month . professor b:  that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to  to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , phd e: Exactly . phd g: Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's professor b: Yeah . phd g: cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our you know , the research , visualizing what these features are doing professor b: Yeah . professor b: so  , you know , to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . professor b: So that 's phd g: I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data so it might be neat , you know . So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools where you we 're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything and I think that 's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools . So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .  it works with Transcriber but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools  because it doesn't mark start and end .  , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files , either  information on users because the user database is that way I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m  various inf  sorted information on individual meetings grad c: Cool . And so l just let me know there it 's mostly Java and Perl but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable . Is do we have the the seat information ? In in the Key files now ? postdoc a:   grad h: The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which postdoc a: Ah . phd g: Oh in For the new one grad h: it 's been recorded , phd g: OK . phd g: I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? professor b: Yeah . phd f: how how w eh where is it in the Key file ? grad h: Right . phd g: Cuz  I haven't been putting it in and in by grad h: You haven't been putting it in . postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits ? professor b: Some of these are missing . phd g: And professor b: Aren't they ? postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits forms ? professor b: Some fall out of phd g: Well it grad h: Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . phd g:  they 're on th right , these , but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files . phd f: Yeah I I never phd g: And I don't think Chuck was either phd f: I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file . phd g: cuz grad h: I had told you guys about it phd f: Oh really ? phd g: Oh , so we 're both sorry . grad h: but phd g: So grad h:  this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text phd g: OK . grad h: I think it 's Edit - key , command Did I show you guys that ? phd d: Yep . phd f: You mentioned it , grad h: I did show it to you , phd f: yeah . grad h: but I think you both said \" no , you 'll just use text file \" . grad h: Yeah , and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings . grad c: u grad h: Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike , phd g: Yeah . phd g: maybe I forgot to d phd f: Takes me no time at all to edit these . grad h: Yeah that 's cuz you kn phd f: I 'm not doing anything . phd g: And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , \" oh what did Chuck do , OK I 'll do that \" . grad h: And then  also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under \" participants \" they were filled in under \" description \" . Oh  also I 'm working on another version of this tool , the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected . And it 's not quite ready to go yet because  it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . So I 'm working on that and it it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out . grad c: Will that also include like batteries dying ? Just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically . phd f: But with the screensaver kicking in , it phd d: But grad h: Now phd d: y yeah . grad h:  the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on the thing . postdoc a: It would be nice if if these had little light indicators , little L E Ds for grad h:  buzzer . grad h: \" Bamp , bamp ! \" professor b: Small shocks postdoc a: Yeah . Oh grad h: OK , disk backup , et cetera ?  I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and he pretty much said \" yeah , you could do that if you want \" but he thought it was a bad idea . In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing  NW archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . grad h: And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . professor b: Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . But he said that that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that , that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably OK . professor b: Really ? grad h: And  , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and  recording meetings . professor b: So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ? grad h: Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable . professor b: Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had  phd e: I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ? grad h:  unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain . grad h: Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure . And second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last . grad h: So I think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea . Can I add one top topic ? We have time ? I wanted to ask , I know that  that Thilo you were , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? And I wanted to know is th phd d: Yeah it 's it Basically it 's done , postdoc a: It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . grad h: Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work . phd d: Yeah it Yeah , it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but it 's solved . Does this mean that the that this could be por  ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of  phd d: Yeah , basically  I did install it on my laptop and yeah postdoc a: Wonderful . CrossPads ? CrossPads ? grad h:  got an email from  James Landay who basically said \" if you 're not using them , could you return them ? \" So he said he doesn't need them , he just periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them and asks them if they 're still using them . professor b: Once ? grad h: We we used them a couple times , postdoc a:   phd f: Them ? There 's more than one ? grad h: but postdoc a: Yeah . professor b: But grad h: My opinion on it is , first , I never take notes anyway so I 'm not gonna use it ,  and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with . postdoc a: And I have  so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the but I I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . I do take notes , I could be taking notes on these things and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings but I don't know . phd d: what is a CrossPad ? professor b: So it 's it 's  it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . grad h: And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things . grad h: But I don't take notes , professor b: And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because  we were interested in in higher - level things , grad h: so . professor b: not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? And  I think that was one of the things , phd d: Yeah . We 'll have a you know , have a scribe , have somebody  take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . And then we did it once or twice and we sort of grad h: Yep , and then just sort of died out . professor b: probably chose the wrong scribe but it was It 's  phd g:  grad h: Yeah that 's right . postdoc a: u but I guess the the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface . phd f:  we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ? postdoc a: Oh it 's la it 's useful , grad h: Because that 's summary . phd g: I think there 's also there 's this use that phd f: Summarize it from the transcription . phd g: the Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X and you don't wanna take notes and you 're you just wanna phd f: Doodle . phd g: get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you know , and and then while you 're bored you don't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X and But in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . I know we haven't been using it but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods grad h: Right . professor b: I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later phd g: so . professor b: and and and put some kind of summary or something  you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . But then you don't you don't have the time reference  that you 'd have if you had it live . And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , professor b: Yeah . phd f: How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ? phd g: so . grad h:  that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time phd g:  postdoc a:   grad h: You know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery postdoc a: Well when when I d grad h: and so you postdoc a: OK . grad h: so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information . phd e: Why grad h: And so there 's a lot of infrastructure which postdoc a: There is an alternative . grad h: unless someone postdoc a: There is an alternative , it 's still , there 's  you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . You c  , I when I when I did it I synchronized it by voice , by whispering \" one , two , three , four \" onto the microphone grad h:  . grad h: Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end phd e: Right . grad h: which someone has to listen to that and find that point , postdoc a: Yeah , it 's transcribed . phd g: Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? Would h  is there a big cau grad h: We can keep all both of them for the whole whole year . phd g: just just in case we grad h: it 's just phd g: even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate  f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out . professor b: Well one thing that we might try  is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . professor b:  part of the reason I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in  the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and grad h: Yep . professor b: and so forth so and and Jane is more into it but eh  you know I don't know if you wanna really do do this all the time so I think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . The p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with  quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to   routinely use it ,  it just hasn't happened anyway . But maybe if we can get a person to phd g: Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute . phd e: Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card . And and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the Linux server and  phd g: So what kind of input would you be ? phd e: so so , if you 're not worried about grad h: Buttons . phd g: You 'd just be pressing like a a phd e: Well well you have a PDA and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . phd e: if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go . grad h:  for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , phd g: M right . grad h: right ? You have the phd g: I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and postdoc a: I like this PDA idea . professor b: where like one one button was \"  - oh \" and then another button was \" that 's great \" and another button \" that 's f \" phd g: Or like this is my \" I 'm supposed to do this \" kind of button , postdoc a: Yeah . phd g: Yeah something like that or postdoc a: And then grad h:  I think the CrossPad idea is a good one . grad h: It 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work .  that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me phd g: Yeah . grad h: and postdoc a: But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too , phd g: W postdoc a: doesn't it ?  grad h: Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard . postdoc a: But  , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition , right ? professor b: No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , postdoc a: OK . postdoc a: I I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a  professor b: Right . You don't have to phd e: The transfer function is less errorful , postdoc a: Oh , nicely put . phd g: Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , right ? That 's why we have this little I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and so if we don't have to return it and we can keep it for a year I don't know . grad h: Well w we don't we certainly don't have to return it , as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . The point is that we haven't used it at all and are we going to ? professor b: So we have no but  by I I would suggest you return one . phd g: We c professor b: We have some aspirations of using them phd g: One would probably be fine . professor b: and phd g: Maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool .  if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more professor b: Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed . grad h: although there is a little phd g: Well , I 'm yeah , that 's not a bad professor b: Yeah , yeah . phd g: Jeremy 's gonna be an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , which sounds funny but I think it should be cool , professor b: Yeah . phd g: You 're you 're gonna tease me ? grad h: Oh , equipment . grad h: And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion so that  the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field . professor b: You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding ? \" We ordered more wireless . \" It 's like wires are the things so you 're wiring you 're you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing . phd g: I just it 's sort of a anachronism ,  it 's like It 's great . professor b:  there 's there 's all this stuff going on  between  Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs   recognition runs , trying to figure things out about the features but it 's it 's all sort of in process , so there 's not much to say right now . grad h: So just the transcript number and then the then the phd e: This is Yes , this is number two for me today . professor b: See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the phd e: Oh . grad h: Should we do simultaneous ? phd g: Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? professor b: Yeah . phd g: You have to plug your ears , by the way  Eric , grad h: Well I have to , phd d: You don't have to <doc-sep>grad a: Alright , so I 'm - I should read all of these numbers ? professor b: OK . professor b: OK , so  i  I don't know whether Ami 's coming or not  but I think we oughta just get started . grad e: Nancy is  currently in Berkeley but not here ? grad c: Nancy 's still stick ? professor b: Don't know . Anyway , so my idea f for today and we can  decide that that isn't the right thing to do was to at spend at least part of the time trying to eh build the influence links , you know which sets of things are  relevant to which decisions and actually I had  specific s suggestion to start first with the path ones . The database ones being in some sense less interesting to us although probably have to be done and so to do that so there 's and the idea was we were gonna do two things grad c: Is your mike on ? professor b: Ah . We were gonna do two things one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what grad d: That 's funny . professor b: and then as a  separate but related task  particularly Bhaskara and I were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to  do what we what we need to do . Once so but du we should sort of have all of the  basic design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to compute it . So I didn't did you get a chance to look at all yet ? grad d: Yeah , I looked at some of that stuff . OK so let 's start with the  belief - nets , the general influence stuff and then we 'll then we 'll also at some point break and talk about the techy stuff . grad e: Well I think one could go there 's I think we can di discuss everything . First of all this I added , I knew from sort of basically this has to be there right ?  professor b: Oh are you gonna go there or not ? Yeah , so one i grad e: Given given   not transverse the castle , the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just professor b: Right , true . And I 'm sure we 'll find more as we go that grad e: And  ? So Go - there in the first place or not is definitely  one of the basic ones .  Is this basically true or false or maybe we 'll get professor b: Well grad d: Which one ? grad e: what ? grad a: \" Go there \" . professor b: so there is this question about grad e: Here we we actually get just probabilities , professor b: Yeah . professor b: the the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when so it 's , you know  current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all , grad e:   professor b: right ? And so that a decision would be do we want that so you could two different things you could do , you could have all those values for Go - there or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when . grad e:  ? grad a:  it seems that you could   it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would wanna have them separate or binary , Go - there and then the the possibilities of how to go there because professor b: OK , that 's let 's start that way . grad a: because , you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time . And so I 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe so who is the user ? Everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A . But when it comes to sort of writing down when you when you do these things is it here ? You sort of have to a write the values this can take . grad e: And here I was really  in some s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because  this case it 's pretty simple , but as we will see the other ones  for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished . professor b: No  grad e: How can I write here that this is something , a number that cr keeps on changing ? But OK . professor b: You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith , these belief - net things ? grad a: no , but I think I 'm following it . grad e: So here is the the we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions . grad d: Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? OK , h well  how is it different from user finance ? grad e:  the finance is sort of here thought of as as the financial policy a person carries out in his life , he is he cheap , average , or spendy ? grad d: Alright . grad e: And  I didn't come  maybe a user I don't know , I didn't want to write greediness , but grad a: Yeah . So Keith w what 's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff . professor b: So this is not just a display , this is actually a GUI to a simulator that will if we tell it all the right things we 'll wind up with a functioning belief - net at the other end . grad e: OK , so here was OK , I can think of  people being cheap , average , or spendy or we can even have a a finer scale moderately cheap , professor b: Doesn't matter . grad d: Well ,  you 've written in you 've written in what  seems to be required like what else is is do you want ? grad e: If that 's permissible then I 'm happy . So here 's here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the  the value of that is gonna have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? It 's you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief - net . And if it does influence anything then you 're gonna need something that converts from the the number here to something that 's relevant to the decision there . So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things . grad e: OK , and so this , oh that grad d: The other thing is that  every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? professor b: Yeah , that 's a good question . grad d:  Well , in Srini 's thing there was this thing there was this  option like proper inferences which suggests that  doesn't happen , automatically . Yeah someone has to track that down , but I but  And and and I think actually  grad e: I just accidentally Oops . professor b: one of the we w items for the  user home base  should be  essentially non - local . I they 're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they 're staying . grad d: Well grad e: Oh just  accidentally erased this , I I just had values here such as   is he s we had in our list we had \" Is he staying in our hotel ? \" , \" Is he staying with friends ? \" , and so forth professor b: Yeah . So my suggestion is we just pick  grad e: Something down here ? professor b: one , you know one  particular one of the  well let 's do the first first one let 's do the one that we sort of already think we did so w that was the of the endpoint ? grad e:   grad d: Is  grad e: Ah , grad d: So it 's true or false ? professor b: No , that 's that 's a grad e: OK . grad c: What 's the difference between mode and endpoint ? grad d: I thought mode , yeah . professor b: although that grad e:  mode was  professor b: Well , that 's grad d: Mode of transportation ? grad e: Yeah . professor b: No , he has he hasn't filled them in yet , is what 's true . grad e: climb , emerge professor b: No no no , these are ju that 's just a point , grad c:  grad d: Well some of those are subsumed by approach . professor b: this is ju grad c: Would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it ? grad a: The Charles Bridge , you know . You know , you y you go first go the town square grad c: Well I eh grad a: No , if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge and doesn't really matter which way you cross which where you end up at the end but the part the good part is walking over it , so . Anyway so let 's just leave it three with three for now grad e:  -  , mmm . professor b: and let 's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started . grad e: OK , we professor b: You 'll see it you 'll see something comes up immediately , that the reason I wanna do this . grad e: w well the  user was  definitely more likely to enter if he 's a local professor b: Right . grad e: more likely to view if he 's a tourist  and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross  professor b: We did , but the three things w that that it contributed to this in fact , the other two aren't up there . so one was the ontology grad e: We 'll d what type of building is it ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: OK , so this is w Right , so what w I what we seem to need here , this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff grad a:  -  professor b: the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes  which were the endpoint decision as seen from the  user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . So each of those the way we had it designed , now we can change the design , but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes  based on the th those three separate considerations grad a:  -  professor b: so if we wanted to do that would have to put in  three intermediate nodes grad e:  we can load it up it you know very simple . grad a: So professor b: and then what you and I have to talk about is , OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow  how do they get combined ? But the they 're they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about . grad e: So that 's w w in our  in in Johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something . professor b: Oh , it was called mode , so this this is m mode here means the same as endpoint . professor b: OK , why don't we ch can we change that ? grad e: We can just rename that , yeah . You know , but that was actually , yeah unfortunately that was a  kind of an intermediate versio that 's I don't think what we would currently do . grad a: Can I ask about \" slurred \" and \" angry \" as inputs to this ? professor b: That 's a grad a: What why ? grad d: Like they 're either true or false grad e: The prosody ? grad a: OK . grad c: If the if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know grad a:   grad d: Therefore grad c: And , you know , possibly  grad a: Less likely to enter . So so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence . professor b: So let 's think about this this question of how do we wanna handle so there 're two separate things . One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is  can we arrange so that I think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in  from on ontology items . So the let 's take the case of the  this endpoint thing , the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business  is it something you physically could enter grad a:   So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set , so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow . professor b: Now grad e: Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these  things we had in there previously in in in some of the other final decisions done here , for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something  professor b: Right . grad e: if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this , then it 's more likely to be entered . professor b: I  that 's I think that 's completely right and  I think that 's good , right ? So what what that says is that we might be able to  take and in particular so so the ones we talked about were  exhibiting and selling grad e: Accessibility . professor b: no , accessibility meant grad e: If it 's closed one probably won't enter . Or if it 's not accessible to a tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it , professor b: OK . grad e: Yeah , all all of these if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things professor b: Right . is that you want an intermediate structure which i  is essentially the or of  for this purpose of of  selling , f fixing , or servicing . So that it  that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose  one of these places is quite like the other . Does that seem right ? So we di grad c: Basic you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ? professor b: if we Yes . professor b: So if well it may be more than endpoint decisions , so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three grad e: These three ? professor b: Yeah . grad d: What ex  and so either those is true f or false ? professor b:   well it it i here 's where it gets a little tricky . grad d: So professor b:  from the belief - net point of view it is from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth . professor b: That that if any of those things is true then it 's the kind of place that you  grad e:  more likely to enter . grad d: So you just wanna have them all pointing to a summary thing ? professor b: You could , yeah . professor b: That 's the p part of the idea , is grad e:  is is that the object type node ? professor b: I d grad e: So are they the is it the kind of object that sells , fixes , or services things ? professor b: Well , o open up object type and let 's see what its values are . professor b: Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects , we called them entities , right ? grad e: Yeah . grad e: Yeah , I w I was just gonna commercial action inside where people p professor b: Well couldn't I do let 's do commercial  landmark and grad e: And where was the accessible , yeah . professor b: Well accessible I think is different cuz that 's tempor that that varies temporally , grad e: Yeah . grad c: What would a hotel fall under ? professor b: I would call that a service , but but I don't know . grad c: Well  in terms of entity type ? professor b: Say w w well it 's co I would s a a again for this purpose I think it 's commercial . grad d:  what does the underscore - T at the end of each of those things signify ? grad e:  things . grad a: So we 're deriving  this the this feature of whether the the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ? Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity ? professor b: Well you could , that 's a that 's a choice . professor b: So  grad a:  it seems like that 's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and you know indoor places that do something else professor b: Yeah , the problem with it is that it sort of putting in a feature just for one decision , grad a: and  . professor b: now w we may wind up having to do that this i anyway , this i grad a: OK . professor b: at a mental level that 's what we we 're gonna have to sort out . professor b: So , you know what does this look like , what are what are  intermediate things that are worth computing , what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions grad a:   professor b: and what 's the best way to organize this so that  it 's clean and and consistent and all that sort of stuff . I 'm just thinking about how people , human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this and it would probably you wouldn't just sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that it must be going on inside or something . grad e: Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things , grad a:   grad e: it 's not either or mmm certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site . IE a a castle or can be a landmark a or not accessible , some statue grad a:    which is to get rid get rid of that l long link between who the user and the endpoint . grad e: Could we just move it like this ? professor b: No no , I don't want the link there at all . professor b: Because what we 're gonna want is an intermediate thing which is  the endpoint decisi the endpoint decision based o on the user models , so what we we what we talked about is three separate endpoint decisions , so let 's make a new node grad e: Yeah . grad c: Just as a suggestion maybe you could \" save as \" to keep your old one nice and clean and so you can mess with this one . The old one was not that not that important , I think but grad c: OK , well , not a big deal then . grad c: Well the Isn't there a \" save as \" inside of java base ? grad e: But I can just take this grad c: OK . This was user something professor b: Well this was grad e: or professor b:  let 's p put it this let 's do endpoint underbar - U . grad e: end point ? professor b: i endpoint , e end poi this is sa grad e: Ah . professor b: let 's say underbar - U , so that 's the endpoint decision  as seen through the grad c: As related from the user model . So let 's let 's actually yeah so lin you can link that up to the grad e: Should I rename this too ? professor b:  yeah , so that , I guess that 's endpoint  grad e:  It 's underscore - E . Or ? Can I ? Where ? What ? professor b: Oh I d eh I don't know . grad c: I think you have to be in move mode before grad e:  - huh . And  maybe th maybe it 's just one who is the user , I don't know , maybe maybe there 's more . grad e: Well if he 's usi if he 's in a car right now what was that people with Harry drove the car into the cafe professor b: Never mind . Now but the now so so but then the question is  so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology , but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse . grad e: Well let 's should we finish this , professor b: Sure , grad e:  but surely the user interests professor b: OK . grad e: yeah , yeah professor b: Well , maybe , I again , I d well , OK , put em in but what we 're gonna wanna do is actually  grad c: Well is grad e: Here this was one of my problems we have the user interest is a is a vector of five hundred values , so  That 's from the user model , grad d: Oh you mean level of interest ? grad e:  -  , no not levels of interest but things you can be interested in . grad d: Oh I see , grad e: Gothic churches versus Baroque townhouses versus grad d: right . So why is it oh it , so it 's like a vector of five hundred one 's or zero 's ? grad e: Yea - n is that grad d: Like for each thing are we are you interested in it or not ? grad e: yeah  I I think grad d: I see . But the other thing you could do is have an and this will give you the flavor of the of what you could have a node that 's that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , I 'm sorry and the user . professor b: So you could have a k a \" fit \" node and again that would have to be computed by someone else grad e:   professor b: but  so that  grad e: Just as a mental note  professor b: Yeah , that 's all . And and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of of entering ? professor b: Yeah . \" Do I have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the Koelner Dome or do I just have to \" \" time to take a picture of the outside ? \" grad e: Schedule ? professor b: Right . grad c: It seems like everything in a user model a affects professor b: Well that 's what we don't wanna do , see that se cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that grad c: Yeah . professor b: an grad c: Cuz if the , and if the user is tired , the user state , grad d: Well grad c: right , it would affect stuff , but I can't see why e anything w everything in the model wouldn't be professor b: Well , but grad d: Right . professor b: Well , that that 's we can't do that , so we we 're gonna have to grad c: Yeah . professor b: but this is a good discussion , we 're gonna have to somehow figure out  some way to encapsulate that  so if there 's some general notion of for example the  relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is is the  compatibility with his current state , so that 's what you 'd have to do , you 'd have to get it down to something which  was itself relatively compact , so it could be compatibility with his current state which would include his money and his time and and his energy grad c: Yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level . grad c: Yeah , but grad d: No but , it 's more than that , like the the more sort of you break it up like because if you have everything pointing to one node it 's like exponential whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it 's not exponential anymore . That 's tha there 's one technical one grad c: Sh - sh yeah , professor b: and the other is it it gets used grad c: S so we 'd basically be doing subgrouping ? Subgrouping , basically into mo grad d: Yeah . But it there 's two advantages , one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential  CBT 's , grad e: Bhaskara ? professor b: the other is it can be it presumably can be used for multiple decisions . professor b: So that if you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could well imagine that that was u grad d: Right . professor b: not only is it sim is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it 's used in multiple places . professor b: OK , you 've got a signal , a d set of decisions  how do we do this ? grad e: What do I have under user state anyhow cuz I named that already something . grad c: I guess the the question  is It 's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again . professor b: Oh but the thing is that we   we had some things that  grad e: That don't . professor b: that don't grad e: The user interests and the user who who who the user is are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke grad c: Sure , but other I thought though the node we 're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action , right ? professor b: the right grad c: Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something .  the that 's the the issue is  would Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of . And anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl  get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible . grad e: Maybe  if we look at the if we split it up again into sort of  if we look at the  the endpoint again we we said that for each of these things there are certain preconditions so you can only enter a place if you are not too tired to do so and also eh have the money to do so if it costs something so if you can afford it and perform it is preconditions . professor b: W w but that eh viewing it without ent yeah view w with our definition of view it 's free cuz you grad e: And so is approaching .  are there are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to like ,  never mind , not in the current professor b: No we have to enter the park .  So let me suggest we switch to another one ,  clearly there 's more work to be done on this grad e:   professor b: but I think it 's gonna be more instructive to to think about  other decisions that we need to make in path land . grad c: So you can save this one as and open up the old one , right and and then everything would be clean . professor b: Why , I think it 's worth saving this one but I think I 'd I 'd like to keep this one grad d: Yeah . professor b: cuz I wanna see if if we 're gonna reuse any of this stuff . grad e:  so this might be What next ? professor b: Well you tell me , so in terms of the  planner what 's what 's a good one to do ? grad e: Well let 's th this go there or not I think is a good one . So what makes things more likely that professor b: Well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse . grad e: So professor b: So Keith this is gonna get into your world because  we 're gonna want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties grad a:   professor b: s and so I I don't yet know how to do this , I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out  discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet . professor b: So that that the Go - there decision will have a node from  discourse , and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for grad e: We we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint . grad e: and so again re that 's completely correct , we have the user model , the situation model here , we don't have the discourse model here yet . professor b: Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth .  This be specific for second year ?  And and we probably will have  something like a discourse for endpoint . grad e:  ? professor b: It 'll have the EVA values if if we have it . OK just for starters and here discourse  professor b: For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . grad e:  well , I think  we 're looking at the the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there . grad e: however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there . grad e: because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably professor b: Yeah , but that doesn't change the fact that you 're you want these two values . So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either yep , yay , A , or nay . OK ? professor b: And they 'll be a y  , a user Go - there and maybe that 's all , I don't know . grad d: Situation Go - there , because it 's whether it 's open or not . grad d:  the that interacts with the  EVA thing if they just wanna view it then it 's fine to go there when it 's closed whereas if they want to  professor b: Right . grad d: so professor b: Right , so that 's that 's where it starts getting to be   essentially more interesting , so what  Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it 's closed or not grad a:   So yeah , that 's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this that node by itself wouldn't distinguish professor b: Well i i it can have di various values . grad d: Yeah , see I 'm I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false . grad a: Also , that node ,  the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for grad e:   grad a: you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the professor b: Could be . So so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that  there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint  decision grad d: I guess the final professor b: maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision  to the Go - there node . grad d: Maybe we could  have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into ? professor b: Could be , yeah . Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed feed into the Go - there S That 's right , grad d: Yeah , right . professor b: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that .  really important in in the belief worl net world not to have loops grad e: I was just gonna professor b:  grad d: Yes . grad e: How long does it take you to to compute  professor b: No it 's much worse than that . It if i loo it it it it it 's not def i it 's not well defined if you 're there are loops , grad d: It things don't converge , yeah . grad e:  R recursive action ? professor b: you just you have to there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't  OK . grad e:  but this isn't , this is this line is just coming from over here . professor b: Yeah , no it 's not a loop yet , I 'm just saying we we , in no , in grad d: Yeah .  what 's what 's another decision you like ? grad e: OK , these have no parents yet , but I guess that sort of doesn't matter . Right ? professor b: Well , the idea is that you go there , you go comes from something about the user from something about the situation and the  the discourse is is a mystery . grad a:  actually professor b: And then also the discourse endpoint , I I guess endpoint sub - D is if you wanna make it consistent . grad a:  actually is this the the right way to have it where  go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because isn't the ,  professor b: I think so . But that still allows for the possibility of the of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from professor b: Maybe not , a Right . grad a: But  OK I was just thinking I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible possible asking of the user professor b: Yeah . grad a: you know hey there 's a strike on ,  does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something professor b: Ah . Good point , I don't I don't know how we 're going to t  grad a: or Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model but , you know , directly out of interaction . professor b:  My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it . professor b: And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things grad a: OK . professor b: you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ? grad a: Yeah . professor b: But  if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ? grad a:   professor b: Alright , but let me let let 's stay with this a minute grad e: But professor b: because I want to do a little bit of organization . The organization is going to be that  the flavor of what 's going on is going to be that  as we s e sort of going to this detail indeed Keith is going to to worry about the various constructions that people might use grad a:   professor b: and Johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard , grad a: Alright . professor b: so what 's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates , OK  they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . I j wa I I assume everybody knows that , I just wanna you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then , grad a:   professor b: so the semantics that you 'll get out of the discourse will be of values that go into the various discourse - based decision nodes . And now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff so it isn't by any means  necessarily a simple thing that you want out . So  if there is an and there is mode of transportation grad e: And it there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said what 's the utterance go giving us professor b: Yeah . professor b: Yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide  how much of th where that goes .  it could be those are two separate things , it could be that the discourse gadget itself integrates em as which would be my guess that you 'd have to do see in order to do reference and stuff like that  you 've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say I wanna go back there , grad a:   professor b: wow , what does that mean and  grad e:  -  grad a: Now . So grad e: But is th is this picture that 's emerging here just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry or is it that we get for each each decision on the very bottom we sort of get the sub - E , sub - D , sub - U and maybe a sub - O \" O \" for \" ontology \"  meta node professor b: I don't know . grad e: could be professor b: This is this is getting into the thing I wanna talk about next , grad e: so this professor b: which is s if that 's true  how do we wanna combine those ? O or when it 's true ? grad e: but this eh w wou wou would be nice though that , you know , we only have at most four at the moment  arrows going f to each of the  bottom decisions . grad e: It 's too much ? professor b: Well i i it see i if it 's fou if it 's four things and each of them has four values it turns out to be a big CPT , it 's not s completely impossi  it 's it 's not beyond what the system could solve but it 's probably beyond what we could actually  write down . grad c: is that what that professor b: Yeah ,  it 's and I don't think it 's gonna g e I don't think it 'll get worse than that by the way , so le that 's a that 's a good grad d: Mmm yeah . grad e: But but four didn't we decide that all of these had true or false ? So is it 's four professor b:  for go there , but not f but not for the other one 's three values for endpoint already . grad d: Yeah ,  you need actually three to the five because  well  if if it has four inputs and then it itself has three values grad c: Right . grad e:  for endpoint ? No it 's it 's sh professor b: EV - it 's the EVA . grad d: No it still has three , professor b: Since ta they will still have three . professor b: Each so you 're   from each point of view you 're making the same decision . professor b: So from the point of view of the ob of the entity grad e: Want to view that , yeah yeah . grad e: yeah grad d: This and also , the other places where , like for example consider endpoint view , it has inputs coming from user budget , user thrift professor b: Right . S so we 're we 're gonna have to use some t care in the knowledge engineering to not have this explode . And in fact I think it doesn't in the sense that  Read it , you know actually with the underlying semantics and stuff I think it isn't like you have two hundred and fifty - six different  ways of of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some place . But  What I was gonna suggest next is maybe we wanna work on this a little longer but I do want to also talk about the thing that we started into now of  well it 's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si same place what rule of combination is used there . professor b: how do they affect it ? And belief - nets have their own beliefs about  what are good ways to do that . So is it it 's it 's clearer n clear enough what the issue is , grad d: Right . professor b: right ? So do we wanna switch that now or we wanna do some more of this ? grad e: R basically w we just need to sort of in order to get some closure on this figure out how we 're gonna get this picture sort of  completely messy . professor b: Well , here he here 's one of the things that that I th you sh you no , I don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface but you it would be great if you could actually just display at a given time  all the things that you pick up , you click on \" endpoint \" , OK and everything else fades grad e:   And I does anybody remember the GUI on this ? grad c:  d I would almost say the other way to do that would be to open u or make you know N - many belief - nets and then open them every time you wanted to look at a different one grad e:   grad c: vers cuz  grad e: It 's probably pretty easy do it to do it in HTML , just grad c: Yeah , but grad e:  grad d: HTML ? grad e: Yeah I have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing and then li consider that it 's respective , professor b: Yeah the well the b grad d: OK . grad e: but professor b: anyway so  it clear that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gonna be able to read the diagram . professor b: Alright , so e we have to figure out some eh eh  basically display hack or something to do this because anyway I I let me consi suggest that 's a s not a first - order consideration , we have two first - order considerations which is what are the  influences A , A , and B how do they get combined mathematically , how do we display them is an issue , but  grad c: I don't , yeah I just don't think this has been designed to support something like that . Yeah , I  , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to  start modifying it for our purposes . Yeah , and  I that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into , but  we have to know what we want first . OK , so why don't you tell us a little bit about decision nodes and what what the choices might be for these ? grad d: So Ah , sorry . So  recall the basic problem which is that  you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . Right ? So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down . So what  helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set , right ? These are all like saying EV or A , right ? So it 's not just a generalized situation like  basically we wanna just take a combination of we wanna view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wanna sort of combine their decisions and create you know ,  sorta weighted combination . So the problem is to specify the  so the conditional property of this given all those , right ? That 's the way belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ? So  that 's what we want , we want for example P of  let 's call this guy Y and let 's call these X - one , X - two XN , right . So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example  E given that these guys are I 'll just refer to this as like X  hat or something ,  the co like all of them ? Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something right ? professor b: Yep . professor b: Alright , so  Is that  I yeah , I just wanna make sure everybody is with us before he goes on . professor b: It 's it 's cl e is is it clear what he wants to compute ? grad a:   So Basically  what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E , s give a number grad a:   What we wanna do is find some principled way of  saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to  add up to one , right ? grad a:  . So what  I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting and we just take the  we essentially take  averages , right ? So for example here two people have voted for A , one has voted for V , and one has voted for E , so we could say that the probabilities are , you know , probability of being E is one over four , because one person voted for E out of four and similarly , probability of so this is probability of E s and then probability of A given all that is  two out of four and probability of V is one out of four . Right ? So that 's step that 's the  yeah that 's the that 's the basic  thing . grad d: Is that all OK ? grad e: And that one outcome , that 's professor b: What ? grad e: it 's X X - one voted for A X - two voted for V grad a:   professor b: S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which may or may not be a good assumption , grad e: That 's the outcome . So we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the  the actual the  verbal content of what the person said , like what  what might be  somehow more  important than the  grad c: X - one matters more i than X - two or grad d: Right . Sure , so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth so we could replace this by  W - one , W - two , W - three , and W - four grad a:  . grad d: right ? And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each  X - hat , we just need that the W 's sum to one . So they can be for example , you know you you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say . And  grad c: So I jus just to make sure I understand this , so in this case  we would still compute the average ? grad d: You 'd compute the weighted average , so the probability of E would be  grad c: OK , so so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be  W one times grad a: Point three . grad c: or A or let 's see , one full quarter times point one grad d: Not one quarter , grad a: No . grad d: so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . So the next possibility is that  we 've given just a single weight to each expert , right , whereas it might be the case that  in certain situations one of the experts is more  reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called \" H \" , OK ? This is a hidden variable . And what this is is it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four , and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . So what 's going on is that  this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . So H produces some you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ? Now this guy he looks at the value of H say it 's two , and then he just selects the  thing . grad a: So so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs . grad c: So H passes a vector on to the next node ? grad d: It could . grad c: It could ? A vector of the weights as the se grad d: Yeah , it could grad c: oh . grad d: Sorry ? grad a: Well a vector with three zero 's and one one , right ? grad c: Oh it 's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in or which one of the weighting systems grad d: Right , so  the way you desc grad c: W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , couldn't you ? OK . grad a:  Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the that 's determined by what the experts are saying , like the type of situ OK .  It it just seems that like without that that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if if  X - one says no , you know , a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , you know ,  that seems like that 'd be weird , grad d: Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also . grad c: Oh The situations that H has , are they built into the net or OK , so they they could either be hand coded or learned or OK . grad c: So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations .  Well ,  to learn them we need data , where are we gonna get data ? Well  we need data with people intentions , right ? grad a: Right , right . But what 's the data about like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ? grad a: Like how thrifty the user is , or do we have access to that ?   grad d: Yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we  , how do we have data about something like   endpoint sub - E , or endpoint sub  you know s S ? grad c: Well , basically you would say , based on in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was , grad d: Mmm . I don't think , well you have a can you bring up the function thing ?  w where is the thing that allows you to sort of grad c: That 's on the added variable , isn't it ? grad d: Oh function properties , is that it ?  , I guess not . And  it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which I think is unlikely , I think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to  just write up little things that allow you to  create such CPU 's on your own in the java base format . Yeah , I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because yeah I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's Right . Well in terms of java base I think it 's basically what you see is what you get in I don't yeah , I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here . By the way   just talking about  about that general end of things  is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they 're interacting with the system and so on ? Like , what kind of questions are being given being asked ? Cuz OK . I 'm just wondering , because in terms of , you know ,   w the figure I was thinking about this figure that we talked about , fifty constructions or whatever that 's  that 's a whole lot of constructions and  you know ,  one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer so ,  I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready .  , I I I I was  I was talking about the , you know , if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know which fifty do I do , I wanna see what people are using , so Well , it will inspire me <doc-sep>phd a: Why is it so cold in here ? professor b: so , we haven't sent around the agenda . So , i  , any agenda items anybody has , wants to talk about , what 's going on ? postdoc g: I c I could talk about the meeting .  phd a: Well , I had a just a quick question but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed , but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker . professor b: OK , so let 's let 's So let 's just do agenda building right now . You were gonna starting to say something ? postdoc g: Well , you you , already know about the meeting that 's coming up and I don't know if if this is appropriate for this . phd e: What meeting ? professor b: We can so we can ta so n NIST is NIST folks are coming by next week postdoc g: OK . professor b: I think phd e: Who 's coming ? professor b: John Fiscus postdoc g: An - anything else , strike anybody ? phd a: we started running recognition on one conversation but it 's the r isn't working yet . phd e: Wha phd a: the main thing would be if anyone has , knowledge about ways to , post - process the wave forms that would give us better recognition , that would be helpful to know about . professor b: Yeah , so ,  phd e: What about , is there anything new with the speech , nonspeech stuff ? phd c: Yeah , we 're working more on it but , it 's not finished . postdoc g: I had thought under my topic that I would mention the , four items that I I , put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting , which includes like the pre - segmentation and the and the developments in multitrans . professor b: Alright , why don't we start off with this , u u I guess the order we brought them up seems fine . So the one issue was that the the , lapel mike , isn't as good as you would like . Right ? phd a: Ri -  , professor b: Is that is that basically the point ? phd a: yeah , the And actually in addition to that , that the the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal . And the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth ,  or and even on prosody , which Don is gonna be working on soon , it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar . phd a: So And I also talked to Mari this morning and she also had a strong preference for doing that . And in fact she said that that 's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too . Right , so one th grad h: Well , so professor b: well one thing I was gonna say was that , i we could get more , of the head mounted microphones even beyond the number of radio channels we have because I think whether it 's radio or wire is probably second - order . grad h: So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it . grad h: And then just sort of about , a thumb or a thumb and a half away from your from your mouth . phd a: But we have more than one type of professor b: How am I d phd a: for instance , you 're phd c: Yeah . phd a: But if we could actually standardize , you know , the the microphones , as much as possible that would be really helpful . professor b: Well ,  it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around , phd d: Yeah . professor b: so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of if this microphone seems OK to people , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things . grad h: Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , some of the Jimlets aren't working . grad h: And so , w  , I 've only been able to find three jacks that are working . phd e: Can we get these , wireless ? grad h: So professor b: No , but my point is phd a: But y we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting . professor b: R r right grad h: I I 'm not sure I 'm follow . Say that again ? professor b: Right now , we 've got , two microphones in the room , that are not quote - unquote standard . professor b: Also what we 've talked before about getting another , radio , grad h: Right . professor b: So ,  so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do , but have them all be the same mike . I think the original reason that it was done the other way was because , it w it was sort of an experimental thing and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or or , more uniformity , phd a: Right . phd a: Well , for short term research it 's just there 's just so much effort that would have to be done up front n  , professor b: Yeah . phd e: Is it because You you 're saying the for dialogue purposes , so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes ? Is that what you mean ? phd a: Well Jane would know more about the transcribers . postdoc g: a couple times , so , yeah , the transcribers notice And in fact there 're some where ,  ugh well ,  there 's it 's the double thing . postdoc g: And he 's always they always they just rave about how wonderful Adam 's Adam 's channel is .  , \" Baaah ! \" phd a: Even if if you 're talking on someone else 's mike it 's still you w postdoc g: Yeah , but  it 's not just that , it 's also you know you professor b: Yeah . postdoc g: It 's also like n no breathing , no You know , it 's like it 's it 's  , professor b: Yeah . postdoc g: it 's really it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view grad h: Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath . professor b: When we 're doing grad h: Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . professor b: Yeah , probably yeah , to the store we talked about and that grad h: Yep . postdoc g: And there was some talk about , maybe the h headphones that are uncomfortable for people , to grad h: Yep . So , as as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than than these things , which I think are horrible . grad h: And , you know , we 're researchers , so we all have big heads . OK , so , Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February and I 've spoken with , u u a lot of people here , not everyone .  , and , he expressed an interest in seeing the room and in , seeing a demonstration of the modified multitrans , which I 'll mention in a second , and also , he was interested in the pre - segmentation and then he 's also interested in the transcription conventions . postdoc g: And ,  So , it seems to me in terms of like , i i it wou You know , OK . So the room , it 's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room and how it how the recordings are done , and that kind of thing . OK , in terms of the multi - trans , well that that 's being modified by Dave Gelbart to , handle multi - channel recording . grad h: Oh , I should 've I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting . I I , @ @ didn't didn't see it , yesterday but I 'm going to see it today . And , that 's that will enable us to do nice  , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments . In terms of , like , pre - segmentation , that that continues to be , a terrific asset to the to the transcribers . What what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to include some information about which channel , there 's some speech in . I 'm just trying to do this by comparing energies ,  normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels . phd c: And so to to give the transcribers some information in which channel there 's there 's speech in addition to to the thing we we did now which is just , speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file . So I 'm I 'm relying on on the segmentation of the mixed file postdoc g: This is good . phd c: but I 'm I 'm trying to subdivide the speech portions into different portions if there is some activity in in different channels . postdoc g: Excellent , so this 'd be like w e providing also speaker ID potentially . professor b: something I guess I didn't put in the list but , on that , same day later on in or maybe it 's No , actually it 's this week , Dave Gelbart and I will be , visiting with John Canny who i you know , is a CS professor , postdoc g: Oh . You know , maybe they 'd wanna stick an array mike here when we 're doing things phd e: That would be cool . professor b: or or maybe it 's it 's not a specific array microphone they want phd d: Yeah . professor b: but they might wanna just , you know , you could imagine them taking the four signals from these these table mikes and trying to do something with them  , I also had a discussion So , w  , we 'll be over over there talking with him , after class on Friday . I had a , discussion today with , Birger Kollmeier who 's a , a German , scientist who 's got a fair sized group doing a range of things . But but , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and and , head models and microphone things . And so , he 's he and possibly a student , there w there 's , a student of his who gave a talk here last year , may come here , in the fall for , sort of a five month , sabbatical . phd e: That that reminds me , I had a a thought of an interesting project that somebody could try to do with the data from here , either using , you know , the the mikes on the table or using signal energies from the head worn mikes , phd d:   phd e: and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting , professor b: Right . phd e: And so you could plot out who was sitting next to who professor b: A little bit , phd e: and professor b: he didn't do a very extreme thing but just it was just sort of phd d: Yeah , yeah . professor b: e e given that , the the the block of wood with the the the two mikes on either side , grad h:   professor b: if I 'm speaking , or if you 're speaking , or someone over there is speaking , it if you look at cross - correlation functions , you end up with a phd d: Yeah . professor b: if if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you you get a big peak there . And if if someone 's talking on on on , one side or the other , it goes the other way . professor b: And then , it it it even looks different if th t if the two two people on either side are talking than if one in the middle . Well I was just thinking , you know , as I was sitting here next to Thilo that  , when he 's talking , my mike probably picks it up better than your guys 's mikes . phd e: So if you just looked at grad h: Oh , that 's another cl cue , phd d: Yeah . phd e: yeah , looked at the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who 's closest to who . professor b: Yeah , well you have to the appropriate normalizations are tricky , and and and are probably the key . phd a: You just search for Adam 's voice on each individual microphone , you pretty much know where everybody 's sitting . postdoc g: Can I ask one thing ?  , so , Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in , microphone arrays . postdoc g: is there  b And I also want to say , his he can't stay all day . He needs to  , leave for  , from here to make a two forty - five flight grad h: Oh , so just morning . postdoc g: So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight but do you think that ,  that , i John Canny should be involved in this somehow or not . professor b: Probably not but I I 'll I 'll I 'll know better after I see him this Friday what what kind of level he wants to get involved . professor b: he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to , or he might have no interest whatsoever . grad h: Is he involved in Ach ! I 'm blanking on the name of the project . NIST has has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and very elaborate software . Is is he the one working on that ? professor b: Well that 's what they 're starting up . professor b: well I think they 've instrumented a room but I don't think they they haven't started recordings yet . They don't have the phd e: Are they going to do video as well ? grad h:  . grad h: Oh , cuz what what I had read was , they had a  very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this , both in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff . professor b: All all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings . professor b: And one one notable difference u u actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not , but one one , difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes . The reason I didn't go for that here was because , the focus , both of my interest and of Adam 's interest was  , in impromptu situations . And we 're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations but that 's because it 's different to get data for research than to actually apply it . professor b: And so , for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it . But the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with , one or more other people i  , in in an p impromptu way , where you didn't didn't actually know what the situation was going to be . And therefore it would not it 'd be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with with some very carefully designed array of microphones . It was just , you know , yet another piece of research and it seemed like we had enough troubles just phd e: So there 's no like portable array of mikes ? professor b: No . So there 's there 's  , there 's a whole range of things there 's a whole array of things , that people do on this . professor b: So , the ,  the big arrays , places , like  , Rutgers , and Brown , and other other places , they have , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred hundred mikes or something . professor b: And it 's and , in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal - processing and they were gonna do the multi - channel stuff , but it d it d we ended up not doing it . grad h: And then they have little ones too professor b: And then they had the little ones , yeah . grad h: but  but they don't have our block of wood , right ? professor b: Yeah , our block of wood is unique . professor b: But the But the No , there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something phd a:   professor b: and and ,  So , yeah , there 's there 's there 's a range of things that people do . professor b: so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that 's that 's a good thing to do .  , whenever I 've described this to other people who are interested on the with the acoustic side that 's invariably the question they ask . Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask \"  , are you recording video ? \" phd a: Right , professor b: right ? phd a: right . professor b: And and the acoustic people will always say , \" well are you doing , array microphones ? \" So it 's it 's a good thing to do , but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined PDA that we have .  , I know that having an array of  , I would imagine it would be more expensive to have a an array of microphones . But couldn't you kind of approximate the natural sis situation by just shutting off  , channels when you 're later on ?  , it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just , you know , record them with an array and then just not use all the data ? grad h: It 's it 's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up . professor b: Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the postdoc g: OK . professor b: But if you get somebody who 's who who has that as a primary interest then that put then that drives it in that direction . grad h: That 's right ,  if someone if someone came in and said we really want to do it , phd a: Right . That would be fine , phd e: So to save that data you You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array ? grad h: Buy more disk space . professor b: But then , you know , there 's it there 's phd e: What you save , if you 're going to do research with it . yeah professor b: There 's I I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is . Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space . grad h: Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing . But I think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional . professor b: Right ? phd a: it seems professor b: So phd e: Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming . phd a: it seems to me that there 's you know , there are good political reasons for for doing this , just getting the data , because there 's a number of sites like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good , but they 'll be recording with video and they 'll be You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go since it 's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings , and just have this other information available . So , if we can get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure and then , I don't know , save it out or have whoever 's interested save that data out , transfer it there , it 'd be g it 'd be good to have have the recording . grad h: You mean to to actually get a microphone array and do that ? phd a: Well , if Even if we 're not grad h: And video and phd a: I 'm not sure about video . That 's sort of an video has a little different nature since right n right now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped .  , but it definitely in the case of microphone arrays , since if there was a community interested in this , then grad h: Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . professor b: See the problem is it it took , it took at least six months for Dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in in the microphones , and in the boxes . And so I think we could get a microphone array in here pretty easily and , have it mixed to to one channel of some sort . professor b: But , e I think for  , how we 're gonna decide For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that .  , you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can And to do that , it we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up , we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels and in this meeting , we 've got eight people and and six mikes . phd a: Well if there 's a way to say time to sort of solve each of these f those professor b: Yeah . phd a: So suppose you can get an array in because there 's some person at Berkeley who 's interested and has some equipment , and suppose we can as we save it we can , you know , transfer it off to some other place that that holds this this data , who 's interested , and even if ICSI it itself isn't .  , and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning , do we need to mix it with the rest ? I don't know . phd a:  it 's just it 's worth considering as sort of grad h: And y it 'd certainly gets skew . phd a: once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time , and and not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data . I mentioned that , b as a practical matter , grad h: Just professor b: but the real issue is that , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew . professor b: which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this . So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later , but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , phd a: I see . But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours which might be useful for for them . phd a: Right ,  at least they 'd have the data and the transcripts , professor b: And then we can offer up the room , phd a: and Right . professor b: Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space , and and yeah , the transcripts , and so on . phd a: But it 's if it 's impossible or if it 's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two , professor b: Well I thi phd a: so professor b: yeah , the thing will be , u u in in again , in talking to these other people to see what you know , what what we can do . phd e: Is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ?  professor b: Right , so we have we phd e:  grad h: Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem , that you have an infrastructure problem , you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped , and you have the problem that no one who 's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it . Internally , but I know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video . So it 's just postdoc g: Yeah , w although I m I I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , that i increase with video . There 's the fact that then  , if i I I 've heard comments about this before , \" why don't you just put on a video camera ? \" But you know , it 's sort of like saying , \"  , well we 're primarily interested in in some dialogue things , but , why don't we just throw a microphone out there . \"  , the thing is , once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in . professor b: So I think NIST or LDC , or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that . postdoc g: I it it occurred to me , has Don signed a human subject 's form ? grad h: Oh ! Probably not . postdoc g: A permission form ? grad h: Has Don have you s did you si I thought you did actually . grad h: Didn't you read a digit string ? phd e: You were here at a meeting before . postdoc g: Did you sign a form ? grad f: Did I ? I don't know . professor b: Yeah , we we postdoc g: But I just grad f: Can I verbally consent ? postdoc g: you know . You 're on recor you 're being recorded postdoc g: o grad f: Yeah . phd a: and professor b: we don't we don't perform electro - shock during these meetings , grad f: I don't care . phd e: How big is the data set ? postdoc g: Oh , it 's what  is one meeting . I didn't want to have any conflicts of , you know , of of when to stop transcribing this one or So I wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose , and and and so phd e:  - huh . postdoc g: And , meetings , you know , I think that they 're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases . So , you know , that means you know , if we 've got two already finished and they 're working on  , right now all eight of them have differe  , additional data sets . postdoc g: And , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the ,  the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps . But , just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set .  , these still , when they 're finished , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . They still need to be edited and all but But it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned . OK , now I wanted to mention the , teleconference I had with , Jonathan Fiscus . postdoc g: He , he in indicated to me that they 've that he 's been , looking , spending a lot of time with I 'm not quite sure the connection , but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system . But it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed for the annotated graphs approach . postdoc g: So what he wants me to do and what we what we will do and  , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting for him to be able to experiment with in this ATLAS System . And they do have some sort of software , at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS and that he wants to experiment with taking our data and putting them in that format , and see how that works out . I I I explained to him in in detail the , conventions that we 're using here in this in this word level transcript . And , you know , I I explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately and and the focus on reliability . He 's he 's very  , independently he asked , \" well what about reliability ? \" So , he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing . OK ,  phd a: Sorry , can you explain what the ATLAS I 'm not familiar with this ATLAS system . postdoc g: Well , you know , at this point I think  , well Adam 's read more in more detail than I have on this . But , there there is a way of viewing  , whenever you have coding categories , and you 're dealing with  , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that that have alternative , choices that you could use for each each of them . grad h: Is is Is ATLAS the his annotated transcription graph stuff ? I don't remember the acronym . The the one the what I think you 're referring to , they they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation . grad h: And that 's basically what I based the format that I did I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff . And so it 's it 's a data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types . phd e: Is this the project that 's sort of , between , NIST and and , a couple of other places ? postdoc g:   And I looked through them and they mainly had to do with this , this , tree structure , annotated tree diagram thing . postdoc g: So ,  and , you know , in terms of like the conventions that I 'm a that I 've adopted , it there there 's no conflict at all . And , \" oh , and how 'd you handle this ? \" And I said , \" well , you know , this way \" and And and we had a really nice conversation .  , OK , now I also wanted to say in a different a different direction is , Brian Kingsbury . I told him he could SSH on and use multi - trans , and have a look at the already done , transcription . And what he said was that , what they 'll be providing is will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information . And , that 's ,  You know , I need to get back to him and and , you know , explore that a little bit more and see what they 'll be giving us in specific , phd a:  . phd e: The p the people postdoc g: but I just haven't had time yet . phd e: The the folks that they 're , subcontracting out the transcription to , are they like court reporters postdoc g: Sorry , what ? Yes . phd e: or postdoc g: Apparently Well , I get the sense they 're kind of like that . Like it 's like a pool of of somewhat  , secretarial I don't think that they 're court reporters . Like medical transcriptionist type people grad h: Nu - it 's mostly it 's for their speech recognition products , phd e: But aren't they 're postdoc g: Yep . grad h: Well they they do send it out but my understanding is that that 's all this company does is transcriptions for IBM for their speech product . grad h: So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that . postdoc g: Up to now it 's been monologues , as far my understood . postdoc g: Brian himself downloaded So So , Adam sent them a CD and Brian himself downloaded  , cuz , you know , we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f terms with what they wanted to do . postdoc g: And then what he 's going to do is check it , a before they go be beyond the first one . professor b: So if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go phd e: OK . grad h: Well , but that 's OK , because , you know , you 'll do all them and then combine them . phd e: Well if you 're tran if you got that channel right there postdoc g: d  , in my case phd c: Yeah . postdoc g: Yeah , I I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with Yeah . phd a: I I think it 's sort of hard just playing the you know , just having played the individual files . phd a: there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before . phd e: Yeah , that 's phd a: it sort of depends where you are in postdoc g: And especially since a lot of these phd d: Yeah . grad h: And the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways . postdoc g: Well , except I can say that my transcribers use the mixed signal mostly grad h: So . postdoc g: unless there 's a huge disparity in terms of the volume on on the mix . In which case , you know , they they wouldn't be able to catch anything except the prominent channel , grad h: Right . postdoc g: Yeah , well phd a: Actually , are th so are they giving any time markings ? grad h: Right . phd a: In other words , if postdoc g: Well , I have to ask him . postdoc g: But but the ,  I did want to say that it 's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people , and if you 're dealing furthermore with highly abstract network concepts you 've never heard of So , you know , one of these people was was transcribing the , networks group talk and she said , \" I don't really know what a lot of these abbreviations are , \" \" but I just put them in parentheses cuz that 's the that 's the convention and I just \" Cuz you know , if you don't know grad h: Oh , I 'd be curious to to look at that . grad h: The networks group meetings are all phd e: Given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have I B M doing it ? Why not just do it all ourselves ? professor b: it 's historical .  , some point ago we thought that  , it \" boy , we 'd really have to ramp up to do that \" , phd c:  - huh . phd d: No , just professor b: you know , like we just did , and , here 's , a a , collaborating institution that 's volunteered to do it . professor b: And it still might be a good thing phd e: I 'm just wondering now phd a: Actu yeah , Mar - Mari asked me the same question as sort of professor b: but phd e: Well , I 'm I 'm wondering now if it 's grad h: Well we can talk about more details later . Let 's see what comes out of it , and and , you know , have some more discussions with them . It 's very a real benefit having Brian involved because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format . grad h: So , Liz , with with the SRI recognizer , can it make use of some time marks ? phd a: OK , so this is a , grad h: I I guess I don't know what that means . phd a: and actually I should say this is what Don has b  , he 's already been really helpful in , chopping up these So so first of all you  , for the SRI front - end , we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge .  , but second of all ,  in general because some of these channels , I 'd say , like , I don't know , at least half of them probably on average are g are ha are have a lot of cross - ta sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk .  , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition , especially forced alignment . So , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's first the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed which we did have some problems with , and Thilo , I think told me why this was , but that people were switching microphones around in the very beginning , so the SRI re phd c: No , th Yeah . They they were not switching them but what they were they were adjusting them , phd a: and they They were not phd c: so . phd a: So we have to sort of normalize the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments . phd a: So we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your your , cuts that you made on the mixed signal . Right ? phd a: the problem is if we have no time marks , then for forced alignment we actually don't know where you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word . And so grad h: Oh , I see , phd a: if if it 's a whole conversation and we get a long , you know , par paragraph of of talk , grad h: it 's for the length . phd a: And , I think with phd e: Well you would need to like a forced alignment before you did the chopping , right ? phd a: No , we used the fact that So when Jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this , whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not , grad h: It 's already chunked . And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary . That 's great , cuz the recognizer can grad h: it 's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also . phd a: Right , and it it helps that it 's made based on sort of heuristics and human ear I think . phd a: Th - but there 's going to be a real problem , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were , which segment they belonged to . phd e: Why not do a a a forced alignment ? grad h: That 's what she 's saying , is that you can't . phd a: If you do a forced alignment on something really grad h: Got  six sixty minutes of phd a: well even if you do it on something really long you need to know you can always chop it up but you need to have a reference of which words went with which , chop . postdoc g: Now wasn't I thought that one of the proposals was that IBM was going to do an initial forced alignment , phd a: So postdoc g: after they grad h: Yeah , but professor b: I I think that they are , grad h: We 'll have to talk to Brian . professor b: yeah , I 'm sure they will and so we we have to have a dialogue with them about it . professor b: it sounds like Liz has some concerns phd a: Maybe they have some you know , maybe actually there is some , even if they 're not fine grained , maybe the transcribers professor b: and phd a: I don't know , maybe it 's saved out in pieces or or something . postdoc g: I just you know , it 's like I got over - taxed with the timing . But the it is true that the segments I haven't tried the segments that Thilo gave you but the segments that in your first meeting are great . phd a: Right , cuz postdoc g: Well , I I was thinking it would be fun to to  , if if you wouldn't mind , to give us a pre - segmentation . postdoc g: maybe you have one already of that first m of the meeting that  , the first transcribed meeting , the one that I transcribed . phd c: I 'm sure I have some postdoc g: Do you have a could you generate a pre - segmentation ? grad h: February sixteenth I think . phd c: but but that 's the one where we 're , trai training on , so that 's a little bit grad h: Oh . phd c: It 's a little bit at odd to postdoc g: Oh , darn . phd a: And actually as you get transcripts just , for new meetings , we can try postdoc g:  - huh . So it 'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers , just to sort of we 're playing around with sort of  , parameters f on the recognizer , postdoc g:   phd a: The first meeting had I think just four people , phd c: Four speakers , yeah . postdoc g: Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday and and I and I was planning to do just a a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you . I guess the other thing , I I can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but , I know you and I talked about this a little bit , there was an issue of , suppose we get in the , I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain , where we we , we have all the data transcribed and we have these transcribers and we were we 're the we 're still a bit slow on feeding at that point we 've caught up and the the the , the weak link is is recording meetings . OK , two questions come , is you know what how how do we  , it 's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't reached that point but how do we step out the recorded meetings ? And the other one is , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ? So , I I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting but there was grad h: We had spoken with them about it . postdoc g: And there is one use that that also we discussed which was when , Dave finishes the and maybe it 's already finished the the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps .  , then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps . It 's just a matter of , you know , providing So if right now you have two overlapping segments in the same time bin , well with with the improvement in the database in in the , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the  , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of of each segment . professor b: One one was  , we had s had some discussion in the past about some very high level labelings , postdoc g: Yeah . The types of overlaps professor b: types of overlaps , and so forth that that someone could do . And the third one is is , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have which is that , if ,  if we have time and people are able to do it , to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech . For instance , marking in some overlapping potentially overlapping fashion , the value of , ar articulatory features . professor b: You know , just sort of say , OK , it 's voiced from here to here , there 's it 's nasal from here to here , and so forth .  , as opposed to doing phonetic  , you know , phonemic and the phonetic analysis , grad h:  professor b: and , assuming , articulatory feature values for those those things . postdoc g: Also if you 're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels , wouldn't it ?  , I would think that that , being able to code that there 's a a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was . professor b: but I think also it 's just the issue that that when you look at the u w u u when you look at Switchboard for instance very close up there are places where whether it 's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone postdoc g:   grad h: Yeah , but but just saying what the professor b: because it 's you know , there 's this movement from here to here postdoc g: Yeah , I 'm sure . professor b: and and and it 's so I phd e: You 're saying r sort of remove the high level constraints and go bottom - up . Maybe there 's there 's even a better way to do it but it but but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things , phd e:   professor b: and  , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to postdoc g: That 's nice . professor b: some sort of categories but but something that allows for overlapping change of these things and then this would give some more ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes , different timing changes as opposed to just \" click , you 're now in this state , which corresponds to this speech sound \" and so on . phd a: So this is like gestural  , these g professor b: Yeah , something like that . professor b: actually if we get into that it might be good to , haul John Ohala into this phd a: Right . phd a: But is is the goal there to have this on meeting data , postdoc g: Excellent . phd a: like so that you can do far field studies of those gestures or  , or is it because you think there 's a different kind of actual production in meetings that people use ? Or ? professor b: No , I think I think it 's for for for that purpose I 'm just viewing meetings as being a a neat way to get people talking naturally . And then you have i and then and then it 's natural in all senses , phd e: Just a source of data ? phd a: I see . professor b: in the sense that you have microphones that are at a distance that you know , one might have , and you have the close mikes , and you have people talking naturally . And the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally , phd a:  - huh . professor b: right ? So so I think that given that it 's that kind of corpus , phd d: Yeah . professor b: if it 's gonna be a very useful corpus  , if you say w OK , we 've limited the use by some of our , censored choices , we don't have the video , we don't and so forth , but there 's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices . professor b: And , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level , and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others . professor b: people have made a lot of use of of TIMIT and ,  w due to its markings , and then the Switchboard transcription thing , well I think has been very useful for a lot of people . professor b: So phd a: I guess I wanted to , sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings . phd a: I actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore and I think they 've what , vehemently said no before but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know , \" well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow professor b: Yeah . Go to their meeting tomorrow and see if we can try , to convince them postdoc g:   professor b: Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings , phd a: because they have And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of of talk than we have here professor b: right ? postdoc g:    phd e: You mean in terms of the topic topics ? phd a: Well , yes and in terms of the the fact that they 're describing abstract things and , just dialogue - wise , professor b:   And then the other thing is , I don't know if this is at all useful , but I asked Lila if I can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building to see if there 's any groups that , for a free lunch , professor b: Yes . grad h: You mean non - ICSI ? phd a: non - ICSI , non - academic , grad h: Yeah , I guess you you can try phd a: you know , like government people , grad h: but phd a: I don't know .  , it seems like we we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches grad h: Well , tha I think that 's her point . phd a: Right , and then we could also we might try advertising again because I think it 'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings postdoc g: Yeah . phd e: Does does John Ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings ? postdoc g:   grad h: And I think , if we could get phd a: So I actually wrote to him and he answered , \" great , that sounds really interesting \" . grad h: But , it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording phd a: So grad h: so u I didn't have to do it each time . phd a: and I was thinking professor b: He - he 's supposed he 's supposed to be trained to do it .  , the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging , grad h: It 's not that hard . phd a: disfluency tagging , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y working on for language modeling . So if you wanna process a utterance and the first thing they say is , \" well \" , and that \" well \" is coded as some kind of interrupt u tag .  , and things like that , th postdoc g: Of course some of that can be li done lexically . phd a: A lot of it can be done postdoc g: And I also they are doing disfluency tagging to some degree already . phd a: I think there 's a second pass and I don't really know what would exist in it . But there 's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of , you know , is it a question or not , postdoc g:   postdoc g: I wanted to whi while we 're  , so , to return just briefly to this question of more meeting data ,  I have two questions . One of them is , Jerry Feldman 's group , they they , are they I know that they recorded one meeting . professor b: I think there 's we should go beyond , ICSI but , there 's a lot of stuff happening at ICSI that we 're not getting now that we could . So th there was the thing in Fillmore 's group but even there he hadn't What he 'd said \" no \" to was for the main meeting . phd e: Well , and and the other thing too is when they originally said \" no \" they didn't know about this post - editing capability thing . professor b: there 's there 's , the networks group , I don't Do they still meeting regularly or ? grad h: Well , I don't know if they meet regularly or not but they are no longer recording . professor b: But  , ha ha have they said they don't want to anymore or ? grad h: ugh , what was his name ? professor b: i i postdoc g: Joe Sokol ? grad h: Yeah . professor b: OK , so they 're down to three or four people grad h: They and they stopped Yeah . postdoc g: We might be able to get the administration grad h: Well he was sort of my contact , so I just need to find out who 's running it now . phd a: Yeah , it One thing that would be nice postdoc g: I don't know phd a: and this it sounds bizarre but , I 'd really like to look at to get some meetings where there 's a little bit of heated discussion , like ar arguments and or emotion , and things like that . Some group , \" yes , we must \" grad h: Who 's willing to get recorded and distributed ? phd a: Well , you know , something phd c: Yeah . grad f: Yeah , I don't think the more political argumentative ones would be willing to phd a:  professor b: Yeah , with with with potential use from the defense department . phd a: No , but maybe stu student , groups or , film - makers , or som Something a little bit colorful . Yeah , th there 's a problem there in terms of , the  commercial value of of st  , postdoc g: Yeah , of course there is this problem though , that if we give them the chance to excise later we e might end up with like five minutes out of a f of m one hour phd d: Film - maker . phd a: And I don't mean that they 're angry phd d: Is postdoc g: of Yes . phd a: but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat . So if anyone has ideas , I 'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people but I don't really know which groups are worth pursuing . postdoc g: Well there was this K P F A grad h: No that 's postdoc g: but OK . phd a: Or postdoc g: And I had one other one other aspect of this which is , Jonathan Fiscus expressed primar  y a major interest in having meetings which were all English speakers . phd e: Did he mean ,  did he mean and non - British ? grad h: Well phd c: The all native . phd e: He said British was OK ? postdoc g: But but Sure , sure , sure . professor b: Why ? grad h: British is English ? phd c:  postdoc g: Yeah . professor b: Well , I don't I don't I don't think if he didn't say that postdoc g: Native speaking . grad h: So , why would he care ? phd e: Knowing the application phd a: That 's professor b: I remember wh I I remember a study phd a: I was thinking , knowing the , n National Institute of Standards , it is all professor b: I remember a study that BBN did where they trained on this was in Wall Street Journal days or something , they trained on American English and then they tested on , different native speakers from different areas . professor b: it was Swiss w Yeah , so it 's so I think , you know , if he 's if he 's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I I I think he would probably want ,  American English , postdoc g: All America , OK . It it yeah , unless we 're gonna train with a whole bunch of postdoc g: I think that the Feldman 's meetings tend to be more that way , aren't they ?  , I sort of feel like they have professor b: I think so , grad h: Maybe . grad h: And maybe there are a few of with us where it was professor b: Yeah . grad h: you know , Dan wasn't there and before Jose started coming , professor b: Yeah . professor b: So , what about what about people who involved in some artistic endeavor ? phd d: Yeah . phd a: Exactly , that 's what I was professor b: You 'd think like they would be phd d: A film - maker . phd a: something where there there is actually discussion where there 's no right or wrong answer but but it 's a matter of opinion kind of thing . phd a: Yeah , we could phd e: A any department that calls itself science phd d: Department . phd d: Computer sci grad h: That postdoc g: We could get Julia Child . phd a: I 'm I 'm actually serious grad h: That 's phd a: because , you know , we have the set up here grad h: Got a ticket . grad f: I know grad h: I could phd a: Not not professor b: Put a little ad up saying , \" come here and argue \" . grad h: and they they they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech . grad h: But when they lost interest in speech they also stopped answering my email about other stuff , so . phd a: Or people who are really h professor b: They could have a discussion about te grad f: I grad h: We should probably bleep that out . grad f: I heard that at Cal Tech they have a special room someone said that they had a special room to get all your frustrations out that you can go to and like throw things and break things . professor b: Yeah , now that is not actually what we grad f: So we can like post a grad h: Th - that 's not what we want . grad f: No , not to that extent phd a: Well , far field mikes can pick up where they threw stuff on the wall . professor b: Yeah , but we don't want them to throw the far field mikes is the thing . postdoc g: It 'd be fun to get like a a p visit from the grad h: There was a dorm room at Tech that , someone had coated the walls and the ceiling , and , the floor with mattresses . professor b: What did we mean by that ? Remember @ @ ? grad h: Liz wanted to talk about methods of improving accuracy by doing pre - processing . phd a: Well I think that that was just sort of I I already asked Thilo professor b: Oh , you already did that . phd a: but that , it would be helpful if I can stay in the loop somehow with , people who are doing any kind of post - processing , whether it 's to separate speakers or to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , or both , that we can sort of try out as we 're running recognition .  , so , i is that Who else is work I guess Dan Ellis and you phd c: Dan , yeah . professor b: he 's he 's interested in in fact we 're look starting to look at some echo cancellation kind of things . professor b: Which  grad h: I am not sure how much that 's an issue with the close talking mikes , professor b:  ? grad h: but who knows ? professor b: Well , let 's w i isn't that what what you want phd a: I don't know . I 'm bad professor b: t No , so No , i w wha what you what you want when you 're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better . professor b: And the question is to w to what extent is it getting hurt by ,  by any room acoustics or is it just  , given that it 's close it 's not a problem ? phd a: It doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear professor b:  phd a: but I 'm not an expert . grad h: e I bet with the lapel mike there 's plenty , room acoustic phd a: That that may be true . phd a: But I don't know how good it can get either by those the those methods grad h: Yeah . grad h: So I I think it 's just , phd a: Oh , I don't know . phd a: All I meant is just that as sort of as this pipeline of research is going on we 're also experimenting with different ASR , techniques . phd e: So the problem is like , on the microphone of somebody who 's not talking they 're picking up signals from other people and that 's causing problems ? phd a: R right , although if they 're not talking , using the the inhouse transcriptions , were sort of O K because the t no one transcribed any words there and we throw it out . phd a: But if they 're talking at all and they 're not talking the whole time , so you get some speech and then a \"  -  \" , and some more speech , so that whole thing is one chunk . And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it , that 's where it 's a big problem . postdoc g: You know , this does like seem like it would relate to some of what Jose 's been working on as well , the encoding of the phd d: Yeah . postdoc g: And and he also , he was phd a: The energy , phd d: Yeah , phd a: right . postdoc g: I was t I was trying to remember , you have this interface where you i you ha you showed us one time on your laptop that you you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events . Because , eh , it 's possible , eh , eh , in a simp sample view , to , nnn , to compare with c with the segment , the the kind of assessment what happened with the the different parameters . And only with a different bands of color for the , few situation , eh , I consider for acoustic event is enough to @ @ . phd d: I I I see that , eh , you are considering now , eh , a very sophisticated , eh , ehm , eh , @ @ set of , eh , graphic s eh , eh , ehm , si symbols to to transcribe . No ? Because , before , you you are talking about the the possibility to include in the Transcriber program eh , a set of symbols , of graphic symbol to t to mark the different situations during the transcription postdoc g: Oh , I w  - huh . No ? postdoc g: Well , you 're saying So , symbols for differences between laugh , and sigh , and and and slam the door and stuff ? phd d: Yeah . postdoc g: Or some other kind of thing ? phd d: No ? To to mark postdoc g: Well , I wouldn't say symbols so much . The the main change that I that I see in the interface is is just that we 'll be able to more finely c  , time things . postdoc g: But I I also st there was another aspect of your work that I was thinking about when I was talking to you phd a:  . postdoc g: which is that it sounded to me , Liz , as though you and , maybe I didn't q understand this , but it sounded to me as though part of the analysis that you 're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together . postdoc g: And th so if you have like a p a s you know , speech from one speaker , then you cut out the part that 's not that speaker , phd a:   postdoc g: and you combine segments from that same speaker to and run them through the recognizer . Is that right ? phd a: Well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker , postdoc g:   phd a: because then we we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries , because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features . phd a: And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have .  , so , you know , that that it would help to have either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio , postdoc g:   phd a: which I don't know how possible this is for the lapel , or to have very to have closer , time you know , synch times , basically , around the speech that gets transcribed in it , or both . So I just wanted to see , you know , on the transcribing end from here things look good . And then the issue of like global processing of some signal and then , you know , before we chop it up is is yet another way we can improve things in that . You can ,   The problem is just that the acoustic when the signal - to - noise ratio is too low , you you 'll get , a  an alignment with the wrong duration pattern or it phd e: Oh , so that 's the problem , is the the signal - to - noise ratio . It 's not the fact that you have like  , what he did is allow you to have , words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations . phd a: Right , things things near the boundaries where if you got your alignment wrong phd e:   It 's that there are problems even in inside the alignments , because of the fact that there 's enough acoustic signal there t for the recognizer to to eat , as part of a word . So , yeah , bottom bottom line is just I wanted to make sure I can be aware of whoever 's working on these signal - processing techniques for , detecting energies , phd d: Yeah . professor b: O K ,  tea has started out there I suggest we c run through our digits and , postdoc g: OK <doc-sep>grad d: and  pick out the ones that have problems , and either correct them or have them re - read . So we probably have like four or five more forms to be read , to be once through the set . I extracted out about an hour 's worth which are the f digits with for which whose speaker have speaker forms , have filled out speaker forms . So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms and for meetings in which the \" key \" file and the transcript files are parsable . Some of the early key files , it looks like , were done by hand , and so they 're not automatically parsable and I have to go back and fix those .  , Liz professor f: So you think two you think two hours is the is the total that we have ? grad d: Yep , yeah . professor f: And you think we th  , I I didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right , but you think we 'll be able to retrieve the other hour , reasonably ? grad d: Yes , absolutely . grad d: So it 's just a question of a little hand - editing of some files and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms . I have this web - based speaker form , and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form , and they 're slowly s trickling in . professor f: So the relevance of the speaker form here , s grad d: It 's for labeling the extracted audio files . grad d: No , I spoke with Jane about that and we sort of decided that it 's probably not an issue that We edit out any of the errors anyway . So the other topic with digits is  , Liz would like to elicit different prosodics , and so we tried last week with them written out in English . So in conversations with Liz and  Jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings . When I look at this , that first line is \" sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . \"  , and so the question is does anyone care ?  , I 've already spoken with Liz and she feels that , correct me if I 'm wrong , that for her , connected numbers is fine , postdoc e: I think two hours is probably fine for a test set , but it may be a little short if we actually wanna do training and adaptation and all that other stuff . professor f: Yeah  , do  you want different prosodics , so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that ? Is that correct ? phd g: Well , we actually figured out a way to grad d: Yeah , the the phd g: the the groupings are randomly generated . professor f: No but , I was asking if that was something you really cared about because if it wasn't , it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people wouldn't , go and do numbers so much . You know if it if it 's phd a:  phd g: I think they may still do it , professor f: Maybe some , but I probably not so much . phd b: What about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group ? phd g: And professor f: Right ? So if you if if you have  grad d: Six dash one , you mean ? professor f: if you go six six six  dash  two nine three one . phd g: I well OK I it might help , I would like to g get away from having only one specific grouping . phd g: but  it seems to me that , at least for us , we can learn to read them as digits postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: and it seems like that might be better for you guys since then you 'll have just more digit data , grad d: Right . phd g: It 's a little bit better for me too because the digits are easier to recognize . Right , read them as single digits , so sixty - one w is read as six one , postdoc e:   phd g: and if people make a mistake we grad d: How about \" O \" versus \" zero \" ? professor f: the other thing is we could just bag it because it 's it 's it 's - I 'm not worrying about it  , because we do have digits training data that we have from  from OGI . I 'm sorry , digits numbers training that we have from OGI , we 've done lots and lots of studies with that . phd g: But it 's nice to get it in this room with the acous professor f: Yeah . phd g:  for it 's professor f: No , no , I guess what I 'm saying is that grad d: Just let them read it how they read it . professor f: to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have . Well that 's fine with me as long as It 's just that I didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits . phd g: So professor f:  we s we we 've We can do this for awhile phd g: OK . Do yo  , do you want do you want this Do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ? phd g: OK . professor f: How much of this do you need ? with  the phd g: It 's actually unclear right now . I just thought well we 're if we 're collec collecting digits , and Adam had said we were running out of the TI forms , I thought it 'd be nice to have them in groups , and probably , all else being equal , it 'd be better for me to just have single digits professor f: OK . phd g: since it 's , you know , a recognizer 's gonna do better on those anyway , and it 's more predictable . So we can know from the transcript what the person said and the transcriber , in general . professor f: OK , well if you pre phd g: But if they make mistakes , it 's no big deal if the people say a hundred instead of \" one OO \" . and also w maybe we can just let them choose \" zero \" versus \" O \" as they as they like because even the same person c sometimes says \" O \" and sometimes says \" zero \" in different context , professor f: Yeah . So I don't have a Specific need cuz if I did I 'd probably try to collect it , you know , without bothering this group , but If we can try it grad d: OK so so I can just add to the instructions to read it as digits not as connected numbers . phd g: Right , and you can give an example like , you know , \" six sixty - one would be read as six one \" . And is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ? professor f: OK . phd g: and grad d: Or is that alright ? phd g:  what do other people think cuz you guys are reading them . postdoc e: I it it to me it looks like you 've got the func the idea of grouping and you have the grou the idea of separation phd g: OK . postdoc e: and , you know , it 's just a matter of u i the instructions , that 's all . grad d: And I think there are about ten different gouping patterns professor f: Let 's try it . phd g: Righ - right , and you just they 're randomly generated and randomly assigned to digits . professor f: Sorry , I I was just gonna say , so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of of recordings now . And you 're saying two hours , is digits , so that 's roughly the ratio then , grad d: Yep . professor f: yeah like you say , I think a couple hours for a for a for a test test set 's OK . It 'd be nice to get , you know , more later because we 'll we might use use this up , in some sense , postdoc e:   professor f: but but  postdoc e: Yeah , I also would like to argue for that cuz it it seems to me that , there 's a real strength in having the same test replicated in a whole bunch of times and adding to that basic test bank . postdoc e:  ? Cuz then you have , you know , more and more , u chances to get away from random errors . And I think , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups , and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having  f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done , which were done by non - native speakers so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set , which is totally American speakers , and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database . I think that  trying to duplicate , spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing TI - digits probably isn't too worthwhile because the recording situation is so different . postdoc e: Except that if you have the stimuli comparable , then it says something about the the contribution of setting professor f: No it 's it 's not the same . postdoc e: and professor f: A little bit , but the other differences are so major . professor f: They 're such major sources of variance that it 's it 's it 's  postdoc e: What 's an example of a of m some of the other differences ? Any other a difference ? professor f: Well i i individual human glottis is going to be different for each one , postdoc e: OK .  , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list , and I 'm sure that they 're doing more specific stuff . grad d: Was it read ? professor f: Yeah , I think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be OGI . professor f: Yeah , no TI - digits was read in th in read in the studio I believe . grad d: But but regardless it 's gonna it 's hard to compare cross - corpus . professor f: And they 're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth , so it 's it 's it 's really pretty different . But I think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework , so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons , it wouldn't be s valid scientifically at least it 'd give you some kind of  frame of reference .  , you know it 's not phd b: Hey Liz , What what do the groupings represent ? postdoc e: OK . phd b: You said there 's like ten different groupings ? phd g: Right , just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line , and number of digits in a group , and the pattern of groupings . Are the patterns like are they based on anything or phd g: I I just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there , and they 're usually grouped into either two , three , or four , four digits at a time . In the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth . So , there 's between ,  Well if you look at it , there are between like three and five groups , and each one has between two and four groupings and I purposely didn't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern . phd g: So grad d: And which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly . grad d: So unlike the previous one , which I d simply replicated TI - digits , this is generated randomly . phd g: But I think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits , whether it 's these digits or TI - digits , to speakers , and compare that to their spontaneous speech , and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data because you might be wearing a different microphone grad d:   phd g: and ,  so it 's it 's nice to have the digits you know , replicated many times . phd g: so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation , and we 're not using the digit data now , but you know grad d: Oh , you 're not . v W we 're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on and I 'd As soon as someone started to read transcript number , that 's read speech and I thought \" well , we 're gonna do better on that , grad d: Oh I see . So those speakers who are very quiet , shy grad d: That would be interesting to see whether that helps . phd g: r Right phd b: Like Adam ? grad d: Do you think that would help adapting on Yeah . phd g: Well , it sh  it 's the same micropho see the nice thing is we have that in the in the same meeting , grad d: Right . phd g: and so you don't get grad d: same microphone , phd a: Yeah . professor f: Yeah  , for the for the  acoustic research , for the signal - processing , farfield stuff , I see it as as as the place that we start . But , th  , it 'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data , but but  the truth is I 'm hoping that we we through the the stuff that that you guys have been doing as you continue that , we get , the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff  ,  nearfield , and then  , we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield , and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield . phd g: The only thing that we don't have , I know this sounds weird , and maybe it 's completely stupid , but we don't have any overlapping digits . phd g: An - yea I know it 's weird , but  phd a: Overlapping digits ! grad d: The the problem I see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load . grad d: No it 's it 's not stupid , it 's just  , try to do it . phd g: I 'm just talkin for the stuff that like Dan Ellis is gonna try , grad d: here , let 's try it . phd g: OK So but grad d: So so you read the last line , I 'll read the first line . professor f: No , I 'll p phd g: So you plu you plug your ears . grad d: Oh I guess if you plug you 're ears you could do it , but then you don't get the the same effects . phd g: Well , what  is actually no not the overlaps that are well - governed linguistically , but the actual fact that there is speech coming from two people grad d: Yeah . phd g: and the beam - forming stuf all the acoustic stuff that like Dan Ellis and and company want to do . phd g: It would take one around amount of ti phd b: It 's the P - make of digit reading . I I mea I 'm I was sort of serious , but I really , I 'm I don't feel strongly enough that it 's a good idea , professor f: See , y grad d: You do the last line , I 'll do the first line . I 'm mean I think it 's doable , grad d: The poor transcribers phd g: I 'm just grad d: they 're gonna hate us . phd g: So , we we could have a round like where you do two at a time , and then the next person picks up when the first guy 's done , or something . professor f: Oh like a round , yeah , like in a a phd g: Like a , phd a: Yeah , just pairwise , professor f: yeah . phd g: I 'm actually sort of serious if it would help people do that kind o but the people who wanna work on it we should talk to them . professor f: I don't think we 're gonna collect vast amounts of data that way , phd g: So . professor f: but I think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody like Dan to play around with , phd g: OK . grad d: I think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session , professor f: yeah . grad d: something like that rather than doing it during a real meeting and you know , do two people at a time then three people at a time and things like that . postdoc e: c c Can I can I have an another another question w about this ? grad d: Oh well . postdoc e: So , there are these digits , which are detached digits , but there are other words that contain the same general phon phoneme sequences . Like \" wonderful \" has \" one \" in it and and Victor Borge had a had a piece on this where he inflated the digits . Well , I wonder if there 's , an if there would be a value in having digits that are in essence embedded in real words to compare in terms of like the articulation of \" one \" in \" wonderful \" versus \" one \" as a digit being read . grad d: Oh ! grad c: It only sounds w good when you scream it , though . postdoc e: Well , I just wanted to offer that as a possible task professor f: Yes . postdoc e: because , you know , if we were to each read his embedded numbers words in sent in sentences cuz it 's like an entire sketch he does and I wouldn't take the inflated version . So he talks about the woman being \" two - derful \" , and and a But , you know , if it were to be deflated , just the normal word , it would be like a little story that we could read . postdoc e: I don't know if it would be useful for comparison , but it 's embedded numbers . grad d: I think for something like that we 'd be better off doing like  TIMIT . Well I think the question is what the research is , so  , I presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here . professor f: So if somebody wanted to do that , if they wanted to look at the the the difference of the  phones in the digits in the context of a word versus  the digits a a non - digit word versus in digit word ,  that would be a good thing to do , but I think someone would have to express interest in that . professor f: I think , to  if you were interested in it then we could do it , for instance . grad d: We have ASR results from Liz , transcript status from Jane , and disk space and storage formats from Don . Does do we have any prefer preference on which way we wanna we wanna go ? phd g: Well I was actually gonna skip the ASR results part , in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about grad d:   phd g: since I think that 's more important to moving forward , but  Morgan has this paper copy and if people have questions , it 's pretty preliminary in terms of ASR results because we didn't do anything fancy , but I think e just having the results there , and pointing out some main conclusions like it 's not the speaking style that differs , it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors . And then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors , which you would expect but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth , leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some kind of  , echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close - talking mikes . phd a: So these grad d: why don't you , if you have a hard copy , why don't you email it to the list . professor f: Yeah , so it 's the same thing ? phd g:  he he professor f: It 's the same thing I mailed to every everybody that w where it was , phd g: it it 's that paper . phd g: and it 's Let 's see , th I guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad . grad d: Horrible ? phd g: And it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech . phd a: So , your your ASR results were run on the channels synchronized , phd g: Yes , cuz that 's all that w had been transcribed at the time , phd a: OK . phd g: the closer t that would be very interesting for us phd b: So if phd g: because we professor f: Yeah , that 's that 's why I only used the part from use phd a: Yeah . phd b: So if there was a segment of speech this long phd g: cuz phd a: Yeah . phd b: and oh and someone said \" oh , \" the whole thing was passed to the recognizer ? grad d: And someone said \" oh \" in the front in the middle . In fact I I pulled out a couple classic examples in case you wanna u use them in your talk of phd b: That 's why there 's so many insertion errors ? grad c:   phd g: Chuck on the lapel , so Chuck wore the lapel three out of four times . phd g: yeah , and I wore the lapel once , and for me the lapel was OK . phd g: Right , but when Chuck wore the lapel and Morgan was talking there 're a couple really long utterances where Chuck is saying a few things inside , and it 's picking up all of Morgan 's words pretty well and so the rec you know , there 're error rates because of insertion Insertions aren't bounded , so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate . So I this is sort of what we expected , but it 's nice to be able to to show it . phd g: And also I just wanted to mention briefly that ,  Andreas and I called up Dan Ellis who 's still stuck in Switzerland , and we were gonna ask him if if there 're you know , what 's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that . \" phd g: And he We 've given him the data we have so far , so these sychronous cases where there are overlap . phd g: And he 's gonna look into trying to run some things that are out there and see how well it can do phd b: So phd g: because right now we 're not able to actually report on recognition in a real paper , like a Eurospeech paper , because it would look sort of premature . phd b: So So the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody 's only speaking a small amount in it , and then try to figure out where they 're speaking based on the other peopl phd g: Right . Or who 's At any point in time who 's the foreground speaker , who 's the background speaker . phd g: So there 's like grad d: But how would you do that automatically ? phd g: Well ther there 's phd a: I 've actually done some experiments with cross - correlation phd b: Right . phd a: and it seems to work pretty well to to get rid of those those overlaps , grad d:  that that 's the sort of thing that you would do . Exactly , so it 's it 's a phd b: So why do you want to do echo cancellation ? phd g: it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation which I don't know enough about to talk about . phd g: But , right , and that would be similar to what you 're also trying to do , but using  , you know , more than energy phd a: Yeah . phd b: So it would be phd g: So the idea is to basically run this on the whole meeting . and get the locations , which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual speak phd b: OK . professor f: Yeah , Dave Dave  is , also gonna be doin usin playing around with echo cancellation for the nearfield farfield stuff , phd g: So . professor f: so we 'll be phd g: And I guess Espen ? This is  is he here too ? professor f: Yeah . phd g: May also be working So it would just be ver that 's really the next step because we can't do too much , you know , on term in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem phd b:   phd b: I think this also ties into one of the things that Jane is gonna talk about too . grad d: I also wanted to say I have done all this chopping up of digits , postdoc e:   Definitely grad d: And and I have scripts that will extract it out from \" key \" files phd g: and Don should grad d: and and do all the naming automatically , phd g: OK . grad c: You 've compiled the list of , speaker names ? phd g: So that that 's it for the grad d:   grad d: and it does all sorts of matches because the way people filled out names is different on every single file so it does a very fuzzy sort of match . phd g: So at this point we can sort of finalize the naming , and so forth , grad c:   phd g: and we 're gonna basically re rewrite out these waveforms that we did because as you notice in the paper your \" M O in one meeting and \" M O - two \" in another meeting and it 's we just need to standardize the grad c: Yeah . phd g: no it 's it 's professor f: No , I didn't notice that actually . So th I now have a script that you can just say basically look up Morgan , phd g: So professor f: Yeah . Is that something we need to talk about at the meeting , or should you just talk with Chuck at some other time ? grad c: I had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms and I don't know exactly who to ask .  , yeah , which is grad d: And I assume half of it is scratch and half of it is ? grad c: I 'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it . grad c: yeah , I don't know what 's typical here , but  , it 's local though , so grad d: That doesn't matter . How do you do that ? professor f: In fact , this is an eighteen gig drive , or is it a thirty six gig drive with eighteen grad d: N grad c: Eighteen . It was a spare that Dave had around grad d: Slash N slash machine name , slash X A in all likelihood . grad d: so the the only question is how much of it The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not . grad d: So what you wanna do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate . grad d: So , the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal because disks don't crash very frequently , grad c: Right .  all of this stuff can be regenerated , phd g: Yeah it 's grad c: it 's just a question grad d: Then put it all on scratch phd g: Well the grad d: because we 're ICSI is is bottlenecked by backup . grad d: So we wanna put phd g: Well I 'd leave all the All the transcript stuff shouldn't should be backed up , postdoc e:   phd g: but all the waveform Sound files should not be backed up , grad c: Yeah , I guess Right . So , I guess th the other question was then , should we shorten them , downsample them , or keep them in their original form ?  grad d: It just depends on your tools .  , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , I would leave them expanded , grad c: Right . grad d: so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything . phd g: We can downsample them , grad c: Do you think that 'd be OK ? phd g: so . phd g:  the r the front - end on the SRI recognizer just downsamples them on the fly , grad c: Yeah , I guess the only argument against downsampling is to preserve just the original files in case we want to experiment with different filtering techniques . phd g: so So that 's professor f: I I I 'm sorry phd g: Yeah , if professor f: Yeah , l  over all our data , we we want to not downsample . phd g: So we 're what we 're doing is we 're writing out  , this is just a question . We 're writing out these individual segments , that wherever there 's a time boundary from Thilo , or or Jane 's transcribers , you know , we we chop it there . phd g: And the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer , professor f:   grad d: Yeah , as I said , since that 's it 's regeneratable , what I would do is take downsample it , phd g: So Yeah . grad d: and compress it however you 're e the SRI recognizer wants to take it in . professor f: ye phd g: So we can't shorten them , grad c: Right . professor f: As yeah , as long as there is a a form that we can come from again , that is not downsampled , then , grad c: r Yeah . That that 's why we need more disk space professor f: uuu phd g: cuz we 're basically duplicating the originals ,  professor f: Yeah . But for for fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on phd g: Oh yeah . professor f: we would like to phd b: So the SRI front - end won't take a  an an a large audio file name and then a a list of segments to chop out from that large audio file ? professor f: Yeah . phd b: They actually have to be chopped out already ? phd g: it 's better if they 're chopped out , phd b:  - huh . phd g: and and it it will be yeah , y we could probably write something to do that , but it 's actually convenient to have them chopped out cuz you can run them , you know , in different orders . grad d: And that 's the whole point about the naming conventions phd g: you can get rid of grad d: is that you could run all the English speaking , phd g: Yeah , it it 's a lot faster . grad d: all the native speakers , and all the non - native speakers , phd g: Right . You can grab everything with the word \" the \" in it , grad d: and all the men , and all the women . phd g: and it 's That 's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time , find the time boundaries and So in principle , yeah , you could do that , phd b: I don't I don't think that 's really right . phd g: but it 's but it 's  grad d: \" That 's just not right , man . \" The the point phd g: These are long These are long grad d: So so s For example , what if you wanted to run run all the native speakers . grad d: Right , so if if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere , extracts out the language , finds the time - marks for that particular one , do it that way . The way they 're doing it , you have that already extracted and it 's embedded in the file name . And so , you know , you just say phd g: We - yeah that 's so that 's part of it grad d: y so you just say you know \" asterisk E asterisk dot wave \" , and you get what you want . And the other part is just that once they 're written out it it is a lot faster to to process them . Otherwise , you 're just accessing grad d: This is all just temporary access , so I don't I think it 's all just It 's fine . Two gig ? phd g: So we 're also looking at these in Waves like for the alignments and so forth . phd g: You need to s have these small files , and in fact , even for the Transcriber program  grad d: Yes you can . phd g: Yeah , if you try to load s really long waveform into X Waves , you 'll be waiting there for phd b: No , I I 'm not suggesting you load a long wave file , phd g: Oh phd b: I 'm just saying you give it a start and an end time . grad d: I th w The transcribers didn't have any problem with that did they Jane ? postdoc e: What 's th u w in what respect ? phd g: Loading the long phd a: No , with the Transcriber tool , it 's no problem . phd g: It takes a very long ti phd a: Yeah just to load a transcription postdoc e: In the in   grad d: Are you talking about Transcriber or X Waves ? phd g: Huh . phd g: Actually , you 're talking about Transcriber , right ? phd a: Yeah . grad d: And they were loading the full mixed files then , postdoc e: Yeah . Well we we have a problem with that , you know , time - wise on a It - it 's a lot slower to load in a long file , grad d:  . phd g: and also to check the file , so if you have a transcript , grad d: Well regardless , it 's professor f: Yeah . phd g:  it 's I I think overall you could get everything to work by accessing the same waveform and trying to find two you know , the begin and end times .  , but I think it 's more efficient , if we have the storage space , to have the small ones . grad d: and , it 's no problem , right ? phd g: Yeah , it 's grad d: Because it 's not backed up . grad d: So we just phd g: It 's it 's just grad d: If we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive and make it all scratch space . phd g: Yeah , so these wouldn't be backed up , the postdoc e: Yeah . grad d: So remind me afterward phd g: And grad d: and I 'll and we 'll look at your disk and see where to put stuff .  , I could just u do a DU on it right ? And just see which how much is on each So . Alright so , first of all , there was a an interest in the transcribe transcription , checking procedures and and I can tell you first , to go through the steps although you 've probably seen them .  , as you might imagine , when you 're dealing with , r really c a fair number of words , and  , @ @ natural speech which means s self - repairs and all these other factors , that there 're lots of things to be , s standardized and streamlined and checked on . And , so , I did a bunch of checks , and the first thing I did was obviously a spell - check . And at that point I discovered certain things like , \" accommodate \" with one \" M \" , that kind of thing . And then , in addition to that , I did an exhaustive listing of the forms in the data file , which included n detecting things like f faulty punctuation and things phd b: I 'm I 'm sorry to interrupt postdoc e: Yeah ? phd b: you could could I just back up a little bit postdoc e: Sure , please , phd b: and postdoc e: yeah , please , please . phd b: So you 're doing these So the whole process is that the transcribers get the conversation postdoc e: Yeah , yeah , yeah . phd b: And then when they 're finished with it , it comes to you , postdoc e: That 's right . And so , I do a an exhaustive listing of the forms Actually , I will go through this in in order , so if if we could maybe wait and stick keep that for a second cuz we 're not ready for that . grad d: So on the fifth page , seven down postdoc e: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Exactly ! Exactly ! Alright so , a spelling check first then an exhaustive listing of the ,  all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached and at that point I pick up things like , oh , you know , word followed by two commas . But there 's w And that that 's done with the assumption that pronunciation variants can be handled . So for things like \" and \" , the fact that someone doesn't say the \" D \" ,  that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription because a a good pronunciation , you know , model would be able to handle that . However , things like \" cuz \" where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable , and furthermore , it 's a form that 's specific to spoken language , those are r reasons f for those reasons I I kept that separate , and used the convention of using \" CUZ \" for that form , however , glossing it so that it 's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one , and a couple of others , not many . So \" wanna \" is another one , \" going \"  , \" gonna \" is another one , with just the assumption , again , that this th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider expect that a pronunciation model , to handle . And Chuck , you in you indicated that \" cuz \" is is one of those that 's handled in a different way also , didn't you ? Did I phd b: I don't remember . postdoc e: but someone told me that in fact \" cuz \" is treated differently in , i u in this context because of that r reason that , it 's a little bit farther than a pronunciation variant . OK , so after that , let 's see , phd b: So that was part of the spell - check , or was that that was after the spell - check ? postdoc e:  . Well so when I get the exhau So the spell - check picks up those words because they 're not in the dictionary . postdoc e: So it gets \" cuz \" and \" wanna \" and that grad d: And then you gloss them ? postdoc e: Yeah ,   Run it through I have a sed You know , so I do sed script saying whenever you see \" gonna \" you know , \" convert it to gonna \" , you know , \" gloss equals quote going - to quote \" , you know . OK , I also wrote a script which will , retrieve anything in curly brackets , or anything which I 've classified as an acronym , and a pronounced acronym . So if it 's \" ACL \" then it 's \" A \" underscore \" C \" underscore \" L \" . grad d: And so so your list here , are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings ? postdoc e: And the th Yes . phd g: can I ask a question about the glossing ,  before we go on ? postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: So , for a word like \" because \" is it that it 's always predictably \" because \" ?  , is \" CUZ \" always meaning \" because \" ? postdoc e: Yes , but not the reverse . So sometimes people will say \" because \" in the meeting , and if if they actually said \" because \" , then it 's written as \" because \" with no w \" cuz \" doesn't even figure into the equation . professor f: But but in our meetings people don't say \" hey cuz how you doing ? \" phd g: Beca - because Right . phd g: so , I guess So , from the point of view of postdoc e: That 's a good point . phd g: The the only problem is that with for the recognition we we map it to \" because \" , grad d: Well , phd g: and so if we know that \" CUZ \" postdoc e: That 's fine . phd g: but , we don't grad d: You have the gloss form so you always replace it . postdoc e: and he 's bee he has a glo he has a script that grad c: I replace the \" cuz \" with \" because \" if it 's glossed . grad c: And phd g: But then there are other glosses that we don't replace , right ? Because postdoc e: Yes . postdoc e: on the different on the different types of comments , which we 'll which we 'll see in just a second . postdoc e: So the pronounceable acronyms get underscores , the things in curly brackets are viewed as comments . w And maybe we 'll expand that grad d:  postdoc e: but the but the comments are , of four types mainly right now . grad d: Can ca postdoc e: Another type is ,  grad d: So a are we done with acronyms ? Cuz I had a question on what what this meant . postdoc e: OK so , gloss is things like replacing the full form u with the , more abbreviated one to the left .  , then you have if it 's  , there 're a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words , and wo some of them are laughs and breathes , so we have  that 's prepended with a v a tag of \" VOC \" . phd a: Whew !  postdoc e: And the non - vocal ones are like door - slams and tappings , and that 's prepended with a no non - vocalization . phd b: So then it just an ending curly brace there , or is there something else in there . postdoc e: Oh yeah , so i e this would grad d: A comment , basically . postdoc e: And then the no non - vocalization would be something like a door - slam . And then the third type right now , is m things that fall in the category of comments about what 's happening . So it could be something like , you know , \" referring to so - and - so \" , \" talking about such - and - such \" , you know , \" looking at so - and - so \" . phd b: on the middle t So , in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left . But in the middle two Th - it 's not applying to anything , right ? postdoc e: Yeah , and this gets substituted here . grad d: Well the \" QUAL \" can be The \" QUAL \" is applying to the left . postdoc e: Well , and actually , it is true that , with respect to \" laugh \" , there 's another one which is \" while laughing \" , grad d: \" While laughing \" . postdoc e: and that is , i i An argument could be made for this tur turning that into a qualitative statement because it 's talking about the thing that preceded it , but at present we haven't been , coding the exact scope of laughing , you know , and so to have \" while laughing \" , you know that it happened somewhere in there which could well mean that it occurred separately and following , or , you know , including some of the utterances to the left . Haven't been awfully precise about that , but I have here , now we 're about to get to the to this now , I have frequencies . But , the very front page deals with this , final c pa  , aspect of the standardization which has to do with the spoken forms like \"  -  \" and \"  -  \" and \" ha \" and \"  -  \" and all these different types . And , someone pointed out to me , this might have been Chuck , about ,  about how a recognizer , if it 's looking for \"  - hmmm \" with three M 's , and it 's transcribed with two M 's , that it might  , that it might increase the error rate which is which would really be a shame because  , I p I personally w would not be able to make a claim that those are dr dramatically different items . postdoc e: I I should say grad d: So it 's a small list . So , I 'm gonna I 'm gonna I 'm gonna check grad d: That that 's known as \" found data \" . I got It was stored in a place I didn't expect , grad c: It 's like the z Zapruder Film . So I 'll I 'll be able to get through that tonight , and then everyth i well , actually later today probably . postdoc e: And I made it so that these are , with a couple exceptions but , things that you wouldn't find in the spell - checker so that they 'll show up really easily . And ,  grad c: Jane , can I ask you a question ? What 's that very last one correspond to ? postdoc e: Sure . grad c: is that like someone 's like burning or some such thing ? postdoc e: So - c I haven't listened to it so I don't know . grad c: Like their hair 's on fire ? postdoc e: I haven't heard it actually . grad d: Ah ! phd a: It 's the Castle of Ah ! phd g: Actually we we gave this to our pronunciation person , grad c: it looks like that . postdoc e: Did she hear the th did she actually hear it ? Cuz I haven't heard it . phd g: No , we just gave her a list of words that , you know , weren't in our dictionary and so of course it picked up stuff like this , and she just didn't listen so she didn't know . Yeah I 'm curious to se hear what it is , but I didn't know wanna change it to something else until I knew . phd g: Maybe it 's \" argh \" ? postdoc e: Well , sss , you know phd g:  grad c: But that 's not really like postdoc e: Hhh . grad c: No one really says \" argh , \" you know , postdoc e:  phd g: Yeah . Right , no one say grad c: it 's not professor f: Well , you just did . phd b: Except for now ! grad c: Well , there 's another there 's another word error . grad d: Ah ! postdoc e: phd g: So , Jane , what 's the d grad d: Maybe he died while dictating . phd g: I have one question about the the \" EH \" versus like the \" AH \" and the \"  \" . postdoc e: That 's partly a nonnative - native thing , phd g: OK . phd g:  postdoc e: But it 's mostly non - native phd a: H phd b: That 's \" eh \" versus \" ah \" ? phd g: S OK . grad d: Eh ? phd g: \" Eh , \" yeah right , cuz there were were some speakers that did definite \" eh 's \" postdoc e:   phd g: but right now we phd b: They were the Canadians , right ? professor f: Canadians , yeah , yeah , yeah . phd g: So , it it 's actually probably good for us to know the difference between the real \" eh \" and the one that 's just like \"  \" or transcribed \" aaa \" postdoc e: Exactly . phd g: cuz in like in Switchboard , you would see e all of these forms , but they all were like \"  \" . grad d: You mean just the single letter \" a \" as in the particle ? phd a: The transcription or grad d: Article . phd g: No , no ,  like the the \"  \" , postdoc e: \"  \" . grad d: I 'm just these poor transcribers , they 're gonna hate this meeting . phd g: But you 're a native German speaker so it 's not a not a issue for phd a: Yeah . phd g: So it 's like Japanese and Spanish postdoc e: Yeah I I think you 've  - huh , yeah . phd g: and grad d: I didn't get that , postdoc e: That makes sense . postdoc e: Yeah , and so , you know , th th I have there are some , Americans who who are using this \" eh \" too , and I haven't listened to it systematically , maybe with some of them , they 'd end up being \"  's \" but , I my spot - checking has made me think that we do have \" eh \" in also , American e e data represented here . But any case , that 's the this is reduced down from really quite a long a much longer list , phd g: Yeah this is great . grad d: Yeah , it 's good , postdoc e: and this is grad d: yeah . postdoc e: functionally pretty , you know , also It was fascinating , I was listening to some of these , I guess two nights ago , and it 's just hilarious to liste to to do a search for the \"  -  's \" . postdoc e: Just I wanted to say I w think it would be fun to make a montage of it because there 's a \"   postdoc e: All these different vocal tracts , you know , but it 's it 's the same item .  , then the acronyms y and the ones in parentheses are ones which the transcriber wasn't sure of , grad d: Oh I see . postdoc e: and I haven't been able to listen to to to clarify , but you can see that the parenthesis convention makes it very easy to find them grad d: o How about question mark ? postdoc e: cuz it 's the only place where where they 're used . grad d: So they so it 's \" PLP ? \" postdoc e: Exactly . Sometimes the contrastive stress is showing up , and ,  professor f: I 'm sorry , I I got lost here . What - w what 's the difference between the parenthesized acronym and the non - parenthesized ? postdoc e: The parenthesized is something that the transcriber thought was ANN , but wasn't entirely sure . So I 'd need to go back or someone needs to go back , and say , you know , yes or no , professor f: Ah . postdoc e: But the parentheses are used only in that context in the transcripts , of of noti noticing that there 's something uncertain . grad d: Yeah , P - make is phd g: Yeah  cuz they they have no idea , grad d: That 's a good one . phd g: but it 's professor f: I I don't recognize a lot of these . grad d: I know ! I I was saying that I think a lot of them are the Networks meeting . phd g: and the PTA was in these , topics about children , postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: Is the P - PTA working ? postdoc e: Right and sometimes , you see a couple of these that are actually \" OK 's \" so it 's it 's may be that they got to the point where  it was low enough understandable understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said \" OK . \" You know , so it isn't really necessarily a an undecipherable acronym , grad c: There 's a lot of \" OK 's \" . This professor f: The number to the left is the number of incidences ? grad d: Count . professor f: So CTS is really big here , grad d: Yeah , I wonder what it is . phd a: So what is the difference between \" papers rustling \" and \" rustling papers \" ? professor f: IP , I know what IP is . postdoc e: But , I I 'm a little hesitant to to collapse across categories unless I actually listen to them . OK well professor f: Wh - the self - referential aspect of these these p phd g: I 'm wai grad c: Yeah . phd g: Well this is exactly how people will prove that these meetings do differ because we 're recording , right ? grad d: Yes . phd g: Y no normally you don't go around saying , \" Now you 've said it six times . phd g: Now you 've said \" postdoc e: But did you notice that there were seven hundred and eighty five instances of \" OK \" ? phd a: Seven hundred eighty - five instances . grad d: And that 's an underestimate postdoc e: Extra forty one if it 's questioned . grad c: Is this after like did you do some  replacements for all the different form of \" OK \" to this ? professor f: Yeah . phd b: Wait a minute , w s professor f: So now we 're up to seven hundred and eighty eight . postdoc e: Yeah that 's grad c: Although , what 's there 's one with a slash after it . phd b: Was that somewhere where they were gonna say \" new speaker \" or something ? postdoc e: No , I looked for that , but that doesn't actually exist . postdoc e: I i it 's the only grad c: There 's postdoc e: it 's the only pattern that has a slash after it , and I think it 's it 's an epiphenomenon . grad d: So I 'll just I was just looking at the bottom of page three there , is that \" to be \" or \" not to be \" . phd b: There 's no tilde in front of it , postdoc e: Oh that 's cute . \" postdoc e: There is th one Y well , no , that 's r that 's legitimate . So now , comments , you can see they 're listed again , same deal , with exhaustive listing of everything found in everything except for these final th thirty minutes . grad d: OK so , on some of these QUALs , postdoc e: Yeah . grad d: are they really QUALs , or are they glosses ? So like there 's a \" QUAL TCL \" . professor f: What 's a QUAL ? grad d: Oh I see , I see . grad c: Sh - shouldn't it be \" QUAL TICKLE \" or something ? grad d: It wasn't said \" TCL \" . grad c: Like it 's not postdoc e: On the in the actual script in the actual transcript , I s I So this this happens in the very first one . postdoc e: Because we they didn't say \" TCL \" , they said \" tickle \" . professor f: I f I forget , what 's QUAL ? postdoc e: Qual - qualifier . grad c: It 's not something you wanna replace with postdoc e: Comment or contextual comment . phd b: So they didn't mean \" tickle \" as in Elmo , grad c: but phd a: Tickle ? professor f: Yeah . phd g: But at some point  , we probably shoul grad d: We 'll probably add it to the language model . phd b: Add what , Liz ? grad d: We can go on lan lan add it to both dictionary and language model . phd g: it 's in the language model , w yeah , but it so it 's the pronunciation model that has to have a pronunciation of \" tickle \" . Right ? phd a: \" tickle \" is pronounced \" tickle \" ? phd b: What are you saying ? grad d: It 's pronounced the same it 's pronounced the same as the verb . phd g: I 'm sorry ! grad d: So I think it 's the language model that makes it different . What I meant is that there should be a pronunciation \" tickle \" for TCL as a word . phd g: And that word in the in , you know , it stays in the language model wherever it was . phd g: Yeah you never would put \" tickle \" in the language model in that form , postdoc e:  grad d: Right . There 's actually a bunch of cases like this with people 's names and phd b: So how w there 'd be a problem for doing the language modeling then with our transcripts the way they are . Yeah so th th there there 's a few cases like that where the  , the word needs to be spelled out in in a consistent way as it would appear in the language , but there 's not very many of these . grad d: And and you 'll ha you 'll have to do it sychronously . grad d: Right , so y so , whoever 's creating the new models , will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously . We have this there is this thing I was gonna talk to you about at some point about , you know , what do we do with the dictionary as we 're up updating the dictionary , these changes have to be consistent with what 's in the Like spelling people 's names and so forth . If we make a spelling correction to their name , like someone had Deborah Tannen 's name mispelled , and since we know who that is , you know , we could correct it , grad d: You can correct it . phd g: but but we need to make sure we have the mispel If it doesn't get corrected we have to have a pronunciation as a mispelled word in the dictionary . postdoc e: Well , of course now the the Tannen corre the spelling c change . So if there 's things that get corrected before we get them , it 's it 's not an issue , postdoc e:   phd g: but if there 's things that  , we change later , then we always have to keep our the dictionary up to date . And then , yeah , in the case of \" tickle \" I guess we would just have a , you know , word \" TCL \" which phd b:   phd g: which normally would be an acronym , you know , \" TCL \" grad d: Right . postdoc e: \" ICSI \" is is one of those that sometimes people pronounce and sometimes they say \" ICSI . postdoc e: So , those that are l are listed in the acronyms , I actually know phd g: Oh yeah . The others , e those really do need to be listened to cuz I haven't been able to go to all the IC ICSI things , phd g: Right , exactly . postdoc e: and and until they 've been listened to they stay as \" ICSI \" . professor f: Don and I were just noticing , love this one over on page three , \" vocal vocal gesture mimicking sound of screwing something into head to hold mike in place . postdoc e: It was ! In fact , it was ! Yeah ! grad d: A lot of these are me the the \" beep is said with a high pit high pitch and lengthening . grad d: That was the I was imitating  , beeping out postdoc e: Yeah , that 's it . phd g: Oh there is something spelled out \" BEEEEEEP \" grad c:  postdoc e: That 's it . Because he was saying , \" How many E 's do I have to allow for ? \" grad c: You need a lot of grad d: What I meant was \" beep \" . postdoc e: And those of course get get picked up in the frequency check grad d: glosses . postdoc e: and you know  it gets kicked out in the spelling , and it also gets kicked out in the , freq frequency listing . postdoc e: I have the there 're various things like \" breathe \" versus \" breath \" versus \" inhale \" and , hhh , you know , I don't know . I I think they don't have any implications for anything else so it 's like I 'm tempted to leave them for now an and It 's easy enough to find them when they 're in curly brackets . professor f: \" Sings finale - type song \" grad c: Yeah , that was in the first meeting . grad d: postdoc e: Yeah , but I don't actually remember what it was . \" postdoc e:  Chuck Chuck led to a refinement here which is to add \" NUMS \" if these are parts of the read numbers . Now you already know i that I had , in places where they hadn't transcribed numbers , I put \" numbers \" in place of any kind of numbers , but there are places where they , it th this convention came later an and at the very first digits task in some transcripts they actually transcribed numbers . And , d Chuck pointed out that this is read speech , and it 's nice to have the option of ignoring it for certain other prob  p  , things . And that 's why there 's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five or three hundred and five times right now which is just well n n \" NUMS \" by itself grad d: \" NUMS \" , yeah .  , i with the sed command you can really just change it however you want because it 's systematically encoded , you know ? grad d: Yep . postdoc e: Have to think about what 's the best for for the overall purposes , but in any case , \" numbers \" and \" NUMS \" are a part of this digits task thing . And actually , th  , the reason I b did it this way was because I initially started out with the other version , you have the numbers and you have the full form and the parentheses , however sometimes people stumble over these numbers they 're saying . And there 's no way of capturing that if you 're putting the numbers off to the side . You can't have the seven and grad d: So what 's to the left of these ? postdoc e: The left is i so example the very first one , grad d:   postdoc e: And then , in here , \" NUMS \" , so it 's not going to be mistaken as a gloss . grad d: OK now , the other example is , in the glosses right there , postdoc e: Thank you . grad d: What what 's to the left of that ? postdoc e: Well now In that case it 's people saying things like \" one one one dash so - and - so \" or they 're saying  \" two  zero \" whatever . postdoc e: And in that case , it 's part of the numbers task , and it 's not gonna be included in the read digits anyway , phd b: So there will be a \" NUMS \" tag on those lines ? postdoc e: so I m in the  There is . postdoc e: So , so gloss in the same line that would have \" gloss quote one one one dash one thirty \" , you 'd have a gloss at the end of the line saying , \" curly bracket NUMS curly bracket \" . postdoc e: So if you if you did a , a \" grep minus V nums \" phd g: Oh , so you could do \" grep minus V nums \" . phd g: So there wouldn't be something like i if somebody said something like , \" Boy , I 'm really tired , OK . Cuz I was doing the \" grep minus V \" quick and dirty and looked like that was working OK , postdoc e:   Now why do we what 's the reason for having like the point five have the \" NUMS \" on it ? Is that just like when they 're talking about their data or something ? postdoc e: This is more because phd g: Or postdoc e: Yeah . Oh these are all these , the \" NUMS point \" , this all where they 're saying \" point \" something or other . phd g: These are all like inside the spontaneous postdoc e: And the other thing too is for readability of the transcript .  if you 're trying to follow this while you 're reading it it 's really hard to read , you know eh , \" so in the data column five has \" , you know , \" one point five compared to seventy nine point six \" , it 's like when you see the words it 's really hard to follow the argument . And this is just really a a way of someone who would handle th the data in a more discourse - y way to be able to follow what 's being said . postdoc e: So this is where Chuck 's , overall h architecture comes in , phd g: I see .  , there will be scripts that are written to convert it into these t these main two uses and th some scripts will take it down th e into a f a for ta take it to a format that 's usable for the recognizer an  , other scripts will take it to a form that 's usable for the for linguistics an and discourse analysis . These will just be things that are generated , grad d: Right postdoc e: and e by using scripts . postdoc e: When things change then the the script will cham change but the but there won't be stored copies of in different versions of things . phd g: So , I guess I 'd have one request here which is just , maybe to make it more robust , th that the tag , whatever you would choose for this type of \" NUMS \" where it 's inside the spontaneous speech , is different than the tag that you use for the read speech . phd g: that way w if we make a mistake parsing , or something , we don't see the \" point five \" , or or it 's not there , then we phd b:   phd g: a Just an And actually for things like \" seven eighths \" , or people do fractions too I guess , you maybe you want one overall tag for sort of that would be similar to that , postdoc e: Except phd g: or As long as they 're sep as they 're different strings that we that 'll make our p sort of processing more robust . postdoc e: Well phd g: Cuz we really will get rid of everything that has the \" NUMS \" string in it . phd b: I suppose what you could do is just make sure that you get rid of everything that has \" curly brace NUMS curly brace \" . postdoc e: You know , as I said I was considering changing it to \" digits \" . And , it just i you know , it 's just a matter of deciding on whatever it is , and being sure the scripts know . phd g: It would probably be safer , if you 're willing , to have a separate tag just because  , then we know for sure .  , phd b: Yeah , and it makes it I guess the thing about phd g: but it it 's probably not hard for a person to tell the difference phd b: Yeah . phd g: because one 's in the context of a you know , a transcribed word string , phd b: Right . postdoc e: The other thing is you can get really so minute with these things phd g: and So postdoc e: and increase the size of the files and the re and decrease the readability to such an extent by simply something like \" percent \" . Now I I could have adopted a similar convention for \" percent \" , but somehow percent is not so hard , you know ? grad d:  . postdoc e: i It 's just when you have these points and you 're trying to figure out where the decimal places are And we could always add it later . And you 'll find both of those in one of these meetings , where he 's saying \" well the first point I wanna make is so - and - so \" and he goes through four points , and also has all these decimals . phd b: what does the SRI recognizer output for things like that ? \" seven point five \" . phd b: Right , the word \" seven \" ? grad d: Well , the numbers ? phd b: The number \" seven \" ? phd g: The word . professor f: So I 'd so \" I 'd like I 'd like to talk about point five \" . phd g: it 's the same point , actually , the the p you know , the word \" to \" and the word y th \" going to \" and \" to go to \" those are two different \" to 's \" and so there 's no distinction there . phd g: It 's just just the word \" point \" has Yeah , every word has only one , yeah e one version even if even if it 's A actually even like the word \" read \" and \" read \" Those are two different words . phd g: So , yeah , I I like the idea of having this in there , I just I was a little bit worried that , the tag for removing the read speech because i What if we have like \" read letters \" or , I don't know , grad d: We might wanna just a separate tag that says it 's read . OK ? Are we done ? postdoc e: Well I wanted to say also regarding the channelized data , grad d: Oh , I guess we 're not done . postdoc e: that , Thilo requested , that we ge get some segments done by hand to e e s reduce the size of the time bins wh like was Chuc - Chuck was mentioning earlier that , that , if you if you said , \" Oh \" and it was in part of a really long , s complex , overlapping segment , that the same start and end times would be held for that one grad d: Well postdoc e: as for the longer utterances , grad d: We did that for one meeting , right , postdoc e: and grad d: so you have that data don't you ? phd a: Yeah , that 's the training data . postdoc e: And he requested that there be , similar , samples done for five minute stretches c involving a variety of speakers and overlapping secti sections . postdoc e: He gave me he did the very nice , he he did some shopping through the data and found segments that would be useful . In addition the I 've I have the transcribers expanding the amount that they 're doing actually . postdoc e: So right now , I know that as of today we got an extra fifteen minutes of that type , and I 'm having them expand the realm on either side of these places where they 've already started . postdoc e: But if if you know , and I and he 's gonna give me some more sections that that he thinks would be useful for this purpose . postdoc e: Because it 's true , if we could do the the more fine grained tuning of this , using an algorithm , that would be so much more efficient . phd a: So I I thought we we sh we sh perhaps we should try to to start with those channelized versions just to just to try it . Give it Give one tr transcriber the the channelized version of of my speech - nonspeech detection and look if if that 's helpful for them , or just let them try if if that 's better or If they if they can postdoc e: You mean to start from scratch f in a brand new transcript ? phd a: Yeah . As it stands we 're still in the phase of sort of , cleaning up the existing data getting things , in i m more tight tightly time  , aligned . I also wanna tell  , I also wanted to r raise the issue that OK so , there 's this idea we 're gonna have this master copy of the transcript , it 's gonna be modified by scripts t into these two different functions . postdoc e: So right now we 've taken this i initial one , it was a single channel basically the way it was input . And now , thanks to the advances made in the interface , we can from now on use the channelized part , and , any changes that are made get made in the channelized version kind of thing . But I wanted to get all the finished all the checks phd b: Yeah , so that has implications for your script . So , have those e e the vis the ten hours that have been transcribed already , have those been channelized ? And I know I 've seen @ @ I 've seen they 've been channelized , postdoc e: Yes , they have . grad d: All ten hours ? grad c: but postdoc e: Except for the missing thirty minutes . grad c: have they  have they been has the time have the time markings been adjusted , p on a per channel grad d: Great . postdoc e: for for a total of like twenty m f for a total of Let 's see , four times total of about an thirty minutes . grad c: I guess , I don't know if we should talk about this now , or not , but I grad d: Well it 's just we 're missing tea . grad c: No , but  my question is like should I wait until all of those are processed , and channelized , like the time markings are adjusted before I do all the processing , and we start like branching off into the into the our layer of  transcripts . postdoc e: Well , you know the problem the problem is that some some of the adjustments that they 're making are to bring are to combine bins that were time bins which were previously separate . postdoc e: And so , i i i it 's true that it 's likely to be adjusted in the way that the words are more complete . postdoc e: so I it 's gonna be a more reliable thing and I 'm not sure grad c:  I 'm sure about that , postdoc e: Yeah . grad c: but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done , or when you expect them to finish it , or postdoc e: Well partly it depends on how  , how e effective it will be to apply an algorithm because i this takes time , grad c: Yeah . phd b: So right now the what you 're doing is you 're taking the  , the o original version and you 're sort of channelizing yourself , right ? grad c: Yeah .  i if the time markings aren't different across channels , like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information . grad c: So , I was just  , originally I had done before like the channelized versions were coming out . grad c: phd b: So I I th I think probably the way it 'll go is that , you know , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma you know primarily come from what you 've done , we 'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals . phd b: And so it should be pretty much identical to what you have t except for the one that they 've already tightened the boundaries on . phd b: So postdoc e: Yeah ,  phd b: and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more , you know , that original version will get updated postdoc e: yeah . phd b: But the I guess the ef the effect for you guys , because you 're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones , that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing you 'd have to constantly re rerun that , grad c: I know . phd g: I I think the harder part is making sure that the transc the transcription phd b: OK . phd g: So if you b merge two things , then you know that it 's the sum of the transcripts , but if you split inside something , you don't where the word which words moved . phd g: And that 's wh that 's where it becomes a little bit  , having to rerun the processing . grad c: You know , if I just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer for an hour and a half , or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference file , that 's not a problem . And I know exactly like what the steps will work what 's going on , in the editing process , phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: So that 's I  I could there were other checks that I did , but it 's I think that we 've unless you think there 's anything else , I think that I 've covered it <doc-sep>professor g: Alright ! grad a: So , sorry about not professor g: We 're not crashing . postdoc f: I don't know if you 're professor g: Yeah , that 's right . postdoc f: maybe raise the issue of microphone ,  procedures with reference to the cleanliness of the recordings . professor g: OK , transcription , microphone issues postdoc f: And then maybe ask , th  , these guys . The we have great great , p steps forward in terms of the nonspeech - speech pre - segmenting of the signal . phd d: use grad a: but I 'm not sure if that 's of general interest or not . professor g:  phd b: Since ,  since I have to leave as usual at three - thirty , can we do the interesting stuff first ? postdoc f: I beg your pardon ? professor g: Well phd c: Which is ? grad a: What 's the interesting stuff ? postdoc f: I beg your pardon ? phd d: Yeah . professor g: But phd b: Well , I guess the work that 's been done on segmentation would be most phd c: Yeah .  , and , the other thing , which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit , which is that , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain with , Manolo Pardo and Javier , Ferreiros , who was here before , was , why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries . So , in what Javier did before when they were doing ,  h he was looking for , speaker change points . As a simplification , he originally did this only using silence as , a putative , speaker change point . professor g: And , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp  , phonetic class , for instance . professor g: And , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , w why are you spending so much time , on the , feature issue , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before phd d:  - huh . professor g: and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also ? phd d: Nnn , yeah . professor g: So then you 've got you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth . And you you might So there was a there was a little bit of a a a a difference of opinion because I I thought that it was it 's interesting to look at what features are useful . professor g: But , on the other hand I saw that the they had a good point that , if we had something that worked for many cases before , maybe starting from there a little bit Because ultimately we 're gonna end up with some s su kind of structure like that , phd d: Yeah . professor g: where you have some kind of simple  and you 're testing the hypothesis that , there is a change . Yeah , why don't we do the speech - nonspeech discussion ? postdoc f: Yeah . Do I I hear you you didn't phd c: Speech - nonspeech ? OK . phd c: so , what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to to detect s speech or nonspeech portions in that . phd c: And what I did so far is I just used our old Munich system , which is an  - ba based system with Gaussian mixtures for s speech and nonspeech . And it was a system which used only one Gaussian for silence and one Gaussian for speech . phd c: Adam , Dave , and I , we did , for that dialogue and I trained it on that . They they can use it or ? postdoc f: they they think it 's a terrific improvement . postdoc f: And , y you also did some something in addition which was , for those in which there was , quiet speakers in the mix . phd c: And so I did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers . grad a: And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet , or did you just ? phd c: I did that for for five minutes of one dialogue grad a: Right . phd c: It 's just our our old Munich , loudness - based spectrum on mel scale twenty twenty critical bands and then loudness . phd c: And four additional features , which is energy , loudness , modified loudness , and zero crossing rate . And so I did some some modifications in those parameters , basically changing the minimum minimum length for s for silence to have , er to have ,  yeah to have more or less , silence portions in inserted . grad a: But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all , phd c: Yeah . But it it saves so much time the the transcribers professor g:  grad a: Yep . W w we originally we did that professor g: Just phd c: but we saw , when we used it , f for our close - talking microphone , which yeah , for our for our recognizer in Munich we saw that w it 's it 's not it 's not so necessary . professor g: Yeah , I don't think it 's a big deal for this application , phd c: Yeah . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with , which is ,  OK , and and also Da - Dave Gelbart .  we ,  regarding the representation of overlaps , because at present , because of the limitations of th the interface we 're using , overlaps are , not being encoded by the transcribers in as complete and , detailed a way as it might be , and as might be desired I think would be desired in the corpus ultimately . postdoc f: So we don't have start and end points at each point where there 's an overlap . So @ @ the limits of the over of of the interface are such that we were at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand the the interface or find other tools which already do what would be useful . Because what would ultimately be , ideal in my my view and I think  , I had the sense that it was consensus , is that , a thorough - going musical score notation would be the best way to go . Because you can have multiple channels , there 's a single time - line , it 's very clear , flexible , and all those nice things . So , I spoke I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on on and he had , excellent ideas on how the interface could be modified to to do this kind of representation . But , he in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already , existing interfaces which might already have these properties .  , I talked with , Munich guys from from Ludwi - Ludwig Maximilians University , who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations . phd c: And they basically said they have they have , a tool they developed themselves and they can't give away , f it 's too error - prone , and had it 's not supported , a a a and professor g: Yeah . phd c: But , Susanne Bur - Burger , who is at se CMU , he wa who was formally at in Munich and w and is now at with CMU , she said she has something which she uses to do eight channels , trans transliterations , eight channels simultaneously , professor g: Excuse me . grad a: Well , maybe we should get it and if it 's good enough we 'll arrange Windows machines to be available . postdoc f: I also wanted to be sure  , I 've I 've seen the this this is called Praat , PRAAT , which I guess means spee speech in Dutch or something . phd c: Yeah , but then I 'm not sure that 's the right thing for us . professor g: The other thing , to keep in mind , we 've been very concerned to get all this rolling so that we would actually have data , postdoc f: Mmm , yeah . professor g: but , I think our outside sponsor is actually gonna kick in postdoc f:   So I don't know if we have a long - term need to do lots and lots of transcribing . I think we had a very quick need to get something out and we 'd like to be able to do some later because just it 's inter it 's interesting . But as far a you know , with with any luck we 'll be able to wind down the larger project . phd b: But you s grad a: What our decision was is that we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps . postdoc f: And and I was just thinking that , if it were possible to bring that in , like , you know , this week , then when they 're encoding the overlaps it would be nice for them to be able to specify when you know , the start points and end points of overlaps . postdoc f: And , so my my goal was w m my charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month . And it 'll be I 'm I 'm I 'm clear that we 'll be able to do that . postdoc f: I sent it to ,  who did I send that to ? I sent it to a list and I thought I sent it to the e to the local list . postdoc f: You saw that ? So Brian did tell me that in fact what you said , that ,  that our that they are making progress and that he 's going that they 're going he 's gonna check the f the output of the first transcription and and professor g: basically it 's it 's all the difference in the world .  , basically it 's just saying that one of our one of our best people is on it , postdoc f: Yeah . So phd b: But about the need for transcription , postdoc f: Isn't that great ? phd b: don't we didn't we previously decide that the IBM transcripts would have to be checked anyway and possibly augmented ? professor g: So . grad a: Yeah , and Dave Gelbart did volunteer , postdoc f: Good . grad a: and since he 's not here , I 'll repeat it to at least modify Transcriber , which , if we don't have something else that works , I think that 's a pretty good way of going . My approach originally , and I 've already hacked on it a little bit it was too slow because I was trying to display all the waveforms . grad a: That if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channels , that 's perfectly sufficient . And and , Dan Ellis 's hack already allows them to be able to display different waveforms to clarify overlaps and things , grad a: No . They can only display one , postdoc f: so that 's already grad a: but they can listen to different ones . postdoc f: Oh , yes , but Well , yes , but what  is that , from the transcriber 's perspective , those two functions are separate . And Dan Ellis 's hack handles the , choice the ability to choose different waveforms from moment to moment . postdoc f:  grad a: The waveform you 're looking at doesn't change . postdoc f: Yeah , but that 's that 's OK , cuz they 're they 're , you know , they 're focused on the ear anyway . postdoc f: the hack to preserve the overlaps better would be one which creates different output files for each channel , grad a: Right . postdoc f: which then would also serve Liz 's request of having , you know , a single channel , separable , cleanly , easily separable , professor g:   Well , holidays may have interrupted things , cuz in in in They seem to want to get absolutely clear on standards for transcription standards and so forth with with us . I just think I told them to contact Jane that , if they had a grad a: Oh , OK . So is it cuz with any luck there 'll actually be a a there 'll be collections at Columbia , collections at at UW  Dan Dan is very interested in doing some other things , grad a: Right . grad a: Well , I think it 's important both for the notation and the machine representation to be the same . postdoc f: N there was also this , email from Dan regarding the speech - non nonspeech segmentation thing . postdoc f: I don't know if , we wanna ,  and Dan Gel - and Dave Gelbart is interested in pursuing the aspect of using amplitude as a a a as a basis for the separation . He was talking he was talking  , we he had postdoc f: Cross professor g: Yeah , cross - correlation . phd c: Cross professor g: I had mentioned this a couple times before , the c the commercial devices that do , voice ,  you know , active miking , postdoc f:  - huh . professor g: So , by doing that , you know , rather than setting any , absolute threshold , you actually can do pretty good , selection of who who 's talking . professor g:  And those those systems work very well , by the way , so people use them in panel discussions and so forth with sound reinforcement differing in in sort of , phd d:  - huh . professor g:  and , those if Boy , the guy I knew who built them , built them like twenty twenty years ago , grad a:  . Cuz there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic , channel identifier . postdoc f: That that , you know , that would g help in terms of encoding of overlaps . postdoc f: The the transcribers would have less , disentangling to do if that were available . So I think , you know , basically you can look at some p you have to play around a little bit , to figure out what the right statistic is , postdoc f: But . professor g: but you compare each microphone to some statistic based on the on the overall phd c: Yeah . So that , you cou yo grad a: Yeah , although the the using the close - talking I think would be much better . professor g: I just it 'd be If I was actually working on it , I 'd sit there and and play around with it , and and get a feeling for it .  , the the the ,  But , you certainly wanna use the close - talking , as a at least . professor g: I don't know if the other would would add some other helpful dimension or not . What what are the different , classes to to code , the the overlap , you will use ? postdoc f: to code d phd d: What you you postdoc f: so types of overlap ? phd d: Yeah . postdoc f: so at a meeting that wasn't transcribed , we worked up a a typology . postdoc f: And ,  phd d: Look like , you t you explaining in the blackboard ? The ? Yeah ? Yeah . So it i the it 's basically a two - tiered structure where the first one is whether the person who 's interrupted continues or not . And then below that there 're subcategories , that have more to do with , you know , is it , simply backchannel phd d:   postdoc f: or is it , someone completing someone else 's thought , or is it someone in introducing a new thought . And I hope that if we do a forced alignment with the close - talking mike , that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred .  , I I I I 've phd b: So who 's gonna do that ? Who 's gonna do forced alignment ? grad a: Well , u  , IBM was going to . grad a: and I imagine they still plan to but but , you know , I haven't spoken with them about that recently . postdoc f: It occurs to me one of my transcribers t told me today that she 'll be finished with one meeting , by professor g:   postdoc f: well , she said tomorrow but then she said you know , but the , you know let 's let 's just , say professor g:   I know these are er , I could send him that if it would be possible , or a good idea or not , to try to do a s forced alignment on what we 're on the way we 're encoding overlaps now . professor g: you know , basically he 's he just studies , he 's a colleague , a friend , and , postdoc f: Yeah ! professor g: they and and , you know , the the organization always did wanna help us . professor g: It was just a question of getting , you know , the right people connected in , who had the time . professor g: So , eh grad a: Is he on the mailing list ? The Meeting Recorder mailing li ? postdoc f: Oh ! grad a: We should add him . phd e: Did something happen , Morgan , that he got put on this , or was he already on it , grad a: Add him . phd e: or ? professor g: No , I , eh , eh , p It it oc I h it 's Yeah , something happened . So , where are we ? Maybe , brief Well , let 's why don't we talk about microphone issues ? postdoc f: Yeah . professor g: That was that was a grad a: so one thing is that I did look on Sony 's for a replacement for the mikes for the head m head - worn ones cuz they 're so uncomfortable . But I think I need someone who knows more about mikes than I do , because I couldn't find a single other model that seemed like it would fit the connector , which seems really unlikely to me . Does anyone , like , know stores or know about mikes who who would know the right questions to ask ? professor g: Oh , I probably would . phd e: You couldn't you couldn't find the right connector to go into these things ? grad a: Yep . When I looked , i they listed one microphone and that 's it phd e: Huh ! grad a: as having that type of connector . Well , let 's look at it together grad a: it seems it seems really unlikely to me that there 's only one . professor g: and postdoc f: And there 's no adaptor for it ? phd c: Yeah . professor g: Who who are we buying these from ? grad a: professor g: That 'd be grad a: I have it downstairs . grad a: And then ,  just in terms of how you wear them  , I had thought about this before .  , when when when you use a product like DragonDictate , they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on . grad a: But I felt that in a real situation we were very seldom gonna get people to really do it and maybe it wasn't worth concentrating on . But professor g: Well , I think that that 's that 's a good back - off position . That 's what I was saying earlier , th that , you know , we are gonna get some recordings that are imperfect and , hey , that 's life . But I I think that it it doesn't hurt , the naturalness of the situation to try to have people wear the microphones properly , if possible , grad a:   professor g: because , the natural situation is really what we have with the microphones on the table . professor g: I think , you know , in the target applications that we 're talking about , people aren't gonna be wearing head - mounted mikes anyway . professor g: So this is just for u these head - mounted mikes are just for use with research . professor g: And , it 's gonna make You know , if if An - Andreas plays around with language modeling , he 's not gonna be m wanna be messed up by people breathing into the microphone . professor g: So it 's it 's ,  grad a: Well , I 'll dig through the documentation to DragonDictate and ste s see if they still have the little form . professor g: Right ?  , and any phd b: It 's interesting , I talked to some IBM guys , last January , I think , I was there . phd b: And they said , the breathing is really a a terrible problem for them , to to not recognize breathing as speech . grad a: Well , that 's the It seemed to me when I was using Dragon that it was really microphone placement helped an in ,  an enormous amount . grad a: So you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose , it doesn't the wind doesn't hit the mike . professor g: I remember when I was when I I I I used , a prominent laboratory 's , speech recognizer about ,  This was , boy , this was a while ago , this was about twelve twelve years ago or something . And , they were they were perturbed with me because I was breathing in instead of breathing out . And they had models for they they had Markov models for br breathing out but they didn't have them for breathing in . Well , what I wondered is whether it 's possible to have to maybe use the display at the beginning grad a: Yeah . postdoc f: to be able to to judge how how correctly  , have someone do some routine whatever , and and then see if when they 're breathing it 's showing . postdoc f: I don't know if the if it 's professor g: I grad a: You can definitely see it . grad a: And so , you know , I 've I 've sat here and watched sometimes the breathing , professor g: I grad a: and the bar going up and down , and I 'm thinking , I could say something , but professor g: I think grad a: I don't want to make people self - conscious . And you can do some , you know , first - order thing about it , which is to have people move it , a away from being just directly in front of the middle phd d: Yeah . postdoc f: Yeah , i professor g: And then , you know , I think there 's not much Because you can't al you know , interfere w you can't fine tune the meeting that much , I think . It just seems like i if something l simple like that can be tweaked and the quality goes , you know , dramatically up , then it might be worth doing . My my feedback from the transcribers is he is always close to crystal clear and and just fan fantastic to phd c: Yeah . postdoc f: I could say something about about the Well , I don't know what you wanna do . professor g: About what ? postdoc f: About the transcribers or anything or ? I don't know . professor g: Well , the other phd b: But , just to to ,  professor g: why don't we do that ? phd b: One more remark , concerning the SRI recognizer . It is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train models for things like breath , and also laughter is very , very frequent and important to to model . phd b: So , grad a: So , phd b: if you can in your transcripts mark grad a: mark them ? phd b: mark very audible breaths and laughter especially , phd c: Mmm . postdoc f: They 're putting Eh , so in curly brackets they put \" inhale \" or \" breath \" . Now they 're they 're not being awfully precise , m So they 're two types of laughter that are not being distinguished . postdoc f: One is when sometimes s someone will start laughing when they 're in the middle of a sentence . postdoc f: And and then the other one is when they finish the sentence and then they laugh . So , I I did s I did some double checking to look through  , you 'd need to have extra  e extra complications , like time tags indicating the beginning and ending of of the laughing through the utterance . phd b: It 's not so I don't think it 's ,  postdoc f: And that and what they 're doing is in both cases just saying \" curly brackets laughing \" a after the unit . phd b: As as long as there is an indication that there was laughter somewhere between two words I think that 's sufficient , phd c: Yeah . phd b: So as long as you can stick a you know , a t a tag in there that that indicates that there was laughter , grad a: Oh , I didn't know that . grad a: That would be a really interesting prosodic feature , postdoc f: Then phd d: Yeah . postdoc f: So , if they laugh between two words , you you 'd get it in between the two words . postdoc f: But if they laugh across three or four words you you get it after those four words . phd b: Well , the thing that you is hard to deal with is whe when they speak while laughing . phd b: But , that 's not as frequent as just laughing between speaking , postdoc f: OK . grad a: So are do you treat breath and laughter as phonetically , or as word models , or what ? phd b: so professor g:  is it ? phd d: Huh . There was a there 's actually a word for  , it 's not just breathing but all kinds of mouth grad a:   grad a: So train a phone in the neural net ? phd b: Same thing ? Yeah . professor g: No grad a: Oh , it does ? phd b: So the so the the mouth noise , word has just a single phone , that is for that . professor g: Right ?  , you could you could say well , let  we now think that laughter should have three sub sub sub - units in the the three states ,  different states . professor g: And then you would have three  , you know , eh , eh , it 's u grad a: Do whatever you want . phd b: And the the pronun the pronunciations the pronunciations are l are somewhat non - standard . phd b: They actually are  , it 's just a single , s  , you know , a single phone in the pronunciation , but it has a self - loop on it , so it can grad a: To go on forever ? phd b: r can go on forever . grad a: And how do you handle it in the language model ? phd b: It 's just a it 's just a word . We also tried , absorbing these  , both laughter and and actually also noise , and ,  phd d: Yeah . We also tried absorbing that into the pause model  , the the the model that that matches the stuff between words . You you did get me to thinking about I I 'm not really sure which is more frequent , whether f f laughing I think it may be an individual thing . grad a: I was noticing that with Dan in the one that we ,  we hand tran hand - segmented , professor g: Yeah . And and one thing that c that we 're not doing , of course , is we 're not claiming to , get be getting a representation of mankind in these recordings . Why don why don't we just since we 're on this vein , why don't we just continue with , what you were gonna say about the transcriptions postdoc f: OK . professor g: and ? postdoc f: the I I 'm really very for I 'm extremely fortunate with the people who , applied and who are transcribing for us . They are ,  really perceptive and very ,  and I 'm not just saying that cuz they might be hearing this . grad a: Cuz they 're gonna be transcribing it in a few days . So I , e you know , I I brought them in and , trained them in pairs because I think people can raise questions grad a: That 's a good idea . postdoc f: you know , i i the they think about different things and they think of different and  , I trained them to , f on about a minute or two of the one that was already transcribed . This also gives me a sense of You know , I can I can use that later , with reference to inter - coder reliability kind of issues . But the main thing was to get them used to the conventions and , you know , the idea of the th th the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back so these th sort of calibration issues . And then , I just set them loose and they 're they all have e a already background in using computers . postdoc f: Well , they they 're very perce they 'll So one of them said \" well , you know , he really said \" n \" , not really \" and \" , phd d: Yeah . postdoc f: so what what should I do with that ? \" grad a: Yeah . If it 's an a noncanonical p \" That one , I think we you know , with Eric 's work , I sort of figure we we can just treat that as a variant . But I told them if if there 's an obvious speech error , like I said in one thing , professor g: OK . postdoc f: and I gave my my example , like I said , \" microfon \" in instead of \" microphone \" . But it but I thought it 's not worth fixing cuz often when you 're speaking everybody knows what what you mean . postdoc f: But I have a convention that if it 's obviously a noncanonical pronunciation a speech error with you know , wi within the realm of resolution that you can tell in this native English American English speaker , you know that I didn't mean to say \" microfon . \" Then you 'd put a little tick at the beginning of the word , professor g: Yeah . postdoc f: and that just signals that , this is not standard , and then in curly brackets \" pron error \" . Well Well , you know , it might be something we 'd wanna do with some , s small subset of the whole thing . Where were they when we needed them ? postdoc f: I think professor g: We certainly wouldn't wanna do it with everything .  , if ,  so I I told them that , we don't know if this will continue past the end of the month professor g:  - huh . postdoc f: and I also m I think they know that the data p source is limited and I may not be able to keep them employed till the end of the month even , although I hope to . professor g: The other thing we could do , actually , is , use them for a more detailed analysis of the overlaps . professor g: Right ? grad a: We could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times . professor g: But I 've been saying the other thing is just go through it for the overlaps . professor g: Right ? postdoc f: And with the right in interface professor g: Given that y and and do so instead of doing phonetic , transcription for the whole thing , phd d: Yeah . professor g: which we know from the Steve 's experience with the Switchboard transcription is , you know , very , very time - consuming . And and you know , it took them I don't know how many months to do to get four hours . But , the other thing is since we 've been spending so much time thinking about overlaps is is maybe get a much more detailed analysis of the overlaps . professor g: I 'm open to every consideration of what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful . professor g: It 's a we have we have due to @ @ variations in funding we have we seem to be doing , very well on m money for this this year , and next year we may have have much less . grad a: Is you mean two thousand one ? professor g: So I don't wanna hire a grad a: Calendar year or ? professor g: calendar year two thousand one . So it 's  , it 's we don't wanna hire a bunch of people , a long - term staff , grad a: Full - time . professor g: because the the funding that we 've gotten is sort of a big chunk for this year . But having temporary people doing some specific thing that we need is actually a perfect match to that kind of , funding . phd e: Are they working full - time now , or ? postdoc f: But Some of them are . But what  is Oh , I shouldn't say it that way because that does sound like forty - hour weeks . I th I I would say they 're probably they don't have o they don't have other things that are taking away their time . professor g: I postdoc f: I I I haven't checked them all , but just spot - checking . grad a: I think it would be professor g: I remember when we were transcribing BeRP , Ron Kay , volunteered to to do some of that . Well , you know , and I also thought , y Liz has this , eh , you know , and I do also , this this interest in the types of overlaps that are involved . These people would be great choices for doing coding of that type if we wanted , grad a: We 'd have to mark them . grad a: I think it would also be interesting to have , a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do , professor g: Yeah . postdoc f: You know , there 's also , the e In my mind , I think A An - Andreas was leading to this topic , the idea that , we haven't yet seen the the type of transcript that we get from IBM , and it may just be , you know , pristine . But on the other hand , given the lesser interface Cuz this is , you know we 've got a good interface , we 've got great headphones , m  professor g: It could be that they will  theirs will end up being a kind of fir first pass or something . professor g: Maybe an elaborate one , cuz again they probably are gonna do these alignments , which will also clear things up . Al - although you have to s Don't you have to start with a close enough approximation of the of the verbal part to be able to ? professor g: Well , tha that 's that 's debatable . professor g: Right ?  , so the so the argument is that if your statistical system is good it will in fact , clean things up . professor g: And , so in principle you could start up with something that was kind of rough  , to give an example of , something we used to do , at one point , back back when Chuck was here in early times , is we would take , da take a word and , have a canonical pronunciation and , if there was five phones in a word , you 'd break up the word , into five equal - length pieces which is completely gross . professor g: Right ?  , th the timing is off all over the place in just about any word . You start off with that and the statistical system then aligns things , and eventually you get something that doesn't really look too bad . professor g: So so I think using a a good aligner , actually can can help a lot . If you have a good alignment , it helps the , th the human in in taking less time to correct things . I guess there 's another aspect , too , and I don't know  , this this is very possibly a different , topic . So like in a you know , the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other , uses of the data , professor g:   postdoc f: so being able to find where so - and - so talked about such - and - such , then ,  e  , I I I did sort of a a rough pass on encoding , like , episode - like level things on the , transcribed meeting professor g:   postdoc f: where that i if that 's something that we wanna do with each meeting , sort of like a ,  it 's like a manifest , when you get a box full of stuff , or or if that 's ,  professor g:   postdoc f: i I I don't know what  , level of detail would be most useful . I don't know i if that 's something that I should do when I look over it , or if we want someone else to do , or whatever . professor g: eh , was p Well , you know , the thing I 'm concerned about is we wanted to do these digits postdoc f: Oh , yeah . But I think , do you , maybe , eh ? Did you prepare some whole thing you wanted us just to see ? phd d: Yeah . professor g: how long a ? phd d: I I think it 's it 's fast , because , I have the results , eh , of the study of different energy without the law length . Eh , eh , in the in the measurement , the average , dividing by the by the , variance . phd d: the other ,  the the last w  , meeting eh , I don't know if you remain we have problem to with the with with the parameter with the representations of parameter , because the the valleys and the peaks in the signal , eh , look like , eh , it doesn't follow to the to the energy in the signal . professor g: No , that there 's no point in going through all of that if that 's the bottom line , really . professor g: So , I I think we have to start  , there there 's two suggestions , really , which is ,  what we said before is that , phd d: Mmm , yeah . professor g: it looks like , at least that you haven't found an obvious way to normalize so that the energy is anything like a reliable , indicator of the overlap . professor g: I I 'm I 'm still a little f think that 's a little funny . professor g: but but you don't want to keep ,  keep knocking at it if it 's if you 're not getting any any result with that . But , the other things that we talked about is , pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things , phd d: Yeah .  But , a completely different tack on it wou is the one that was suggested , by your colleagues in Spain , phd d: Yeah . professor g: That is to say , use , you know , as as you 're doing with the speech , nonspeech , use some very general features . professor g: You know , have a have a couple Markov models and and , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap . professor g: And let the , statistical system determine what 's the right way to look at the data . professor g: I I , I think it would be interesting to find individual features and put them together . professor g: But given the limitation in time and given the fact that Javier 's system already exists doing this sort of thing , phd d: Yeah . professor g: but , its main limitation is that , again , it 's only looking at silences which would phd d: Yeah . phd d: I I I think that , eh , the possibility , eh , can be that , eh , Thilo , eh , working , eh , with a new class , not only , eh , nonspeech and speech , but , eh , in in in the speech class , professor g:   phd d: dividing , eh , speech , eh , of from a speaker and overlapping , to try to to do , eh , eh , a fast a fast , eh , experiment to to prove that , nnn , this fea eh , general feature , eh , can solve the the the problem , professor g: Yeah . phd d: And I hope the the next week I will have , eh , some results and we we will show we will see , eh , the the parameter the pitch , eh , tracking in with the program . phd d: And , nnn , nnn professor g: Ha - h have you ever looked at the ,  Javier 's , speech segmenter ? phd c: No . professor g: Cuz again the idea is there the limitation there again was that he was he was only using it to look at silence as a as a as a as a p putative split point between speakers . professor g: But if you included , broadened classes then in principle maybe you can cover the overlap cases . phd c: Yeah , but I 'm not too sure if if we can really represent overlap with with the s detector I I I used up to now , phd d: Mmm , yeah . grad a: I think with phd c: the to speech - nonspeech as grad a: That 's right . But I think Javier 's phd c: it 's only speech or it 's it 's it 's nonspeech . professor g: N n grad a: It doesn't have the same Gaus -  , H M M modeling , phd c: Yeah . grad a: But ,  professor g: Well , it 's sort of has a simple one . grad a: Does it ? professor g: Right ? It 's it 's just it 's just a isn't it just a Gaussian phd d: Yeah . Oh , it doesn't have it doesn't have any temporal ,  ? grad a: Maybe I 'm misremembering , but I did not think it had a Markov professor g: I thought it Yeah . phd d: No , Javier di doesn't worked with , a Markov grad a: Yeah , I didn't think so . So he 's just he just computes a Gaussian over potential grad a: Yep . professor g: And and grad a: It 's just , that i it he has the two - pass issue that What he does is , as a first pass he he p he does , a guess at where the divisions might be and he overestimates . And that 's just a data reduction step , so that you 're not trying at every time interval . grad a: And right now he 's doing that with silence and that doesn't work with the Meeting Recorder . professor g: The other thing one could do is Couldn't  , it 's So you have two categories phd c: Yeah . Couldn't you have a third category ? So you have ,  you have , nonspeech , single - person speech , and multiple - person speech ? postdoc f: He has this on his board actually . Don't you have , like those those several different categories on the board ? professor g: Right ? And then you have a Markov model for each ? phd c:  I 'm not sure . But it 's not too easy , I think , the the transition between the different class , to model them in in the system I have now . professor g: the th the reason why , I was suggesting originally that we look at features is because I thought , well , we 're doing something we haven't done before , phd c: Yeah . professor g: It seems like if two people two or more people talk at once , it should get louder , phd c: Yeah . professor g: and , there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours , phd c: I had the impression . professor g: and , there should overall be a , smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic sequence in the spectrum . professor g: So far , Jose has has been By the way , I was told I should be calling you Pepe , but phd d: Yeah . professor g: the has has , been exploring , e largely the energy issue and , as with a lot of things , it is not  , like this , it 's not as simple as it sounds . professor g: And then there 's , you know Is it energy ? Is it log energy ? Is it LPC residual energy ? Is it is it is it , delta of those things ?  , what is it no Obviously , just a simple number absolute number isn't gonna work . So it should be with compared to what ? Should there be a long window for the normalizing factor and a short window for what you 're looking at ? phd c: Yeah . professor g: Or , you know , how b short should they be ? So , phd d:  . professor g: th he 's been playing around with a lot of these different things and and so far at least has not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator . professor g: So I I still have a hunch that there 's it 's in there some place , but it may be given that you have a limited time here , it it just may not be the best thing to to to focus on for the remaining of it . professor g: So pitch - related and harmonic - related , I 'm I 'm somewhat more hopeful for it . professor g: But it seems like if we just wanna get something to work , phd c: Yeah . professor g: that , their suggestion of of Th - they were suggesting going to Markov models , but in addition there 's an expansion of what Javier did . professor g: even if the features that you give it are maybe not ideal for it , it 's just sort of this general filter bank phd c: Yeah . professor g: or or cepstrum or something ,  Eee it 's in there somewhere probably . phd d: But , eh , what did you think about the possibility of using the Javier software ? Eh , the ,  the ,  the BIC criterion , the the t to train the the Gaussian , eh , using the the mark , eh , by hand , eh , eh , to distinguish be mmm , to train overlapping zone and speech zone .  , eh , I I I think that an interesting , eh , experiment , eh , could be , th eh , to prove that , mmm , if s we suppose that , eh , the the first step  , the the classifier what were the classifier from Javier or classifier from Thilo ? W What happen with the second step ? I  , what what happen with the , eh the , clu the ,  the clu the clustering process ? grad a:   grad a: What do you mean ? phd d: I  , that is is enough is enough , eh , to work well , eh , to , eh , separate or to distinguish , eh , between overlapping zone and , eh , speaker zone ? Because th if if we if we , eh , nnn , develop an classifier and the second step doesn't work well , eh , we have another problem . I had tried doing it by hand at one point with a very short sample , phd d: N grad a: and it worked pretty well , but I haven't worked with it a lot . So what I d I d I took a hand - segmented sample phd d: Nnn , yeah . grad a: and I added ten times the amount of numbers at random , phd d: Yeah . But is is if grad a: But this was just very anecdotal sort of thing . phd d: But it 's possible with my segmentation by hand that we have information about the the overlapping , grad a: Right . So if we if we fed the hand - segmentation to Javier 's and it doesn't work , then we know something 's wrong . phd d: this kind o emph emphasises parameter and Gaussian grad a: Yeah . Y do you know where his software is ? Have you used it at all ? phd d: I yeah have "

        "Summary": "To ensure accuracy, a small percentage of transcripts will be modified to correct any misread or uncorrected digits. In order to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags, a speaker database will be compiled. The initial test set of digits has been completed, consisting of 4,000 lines with each line containing 1-10 digits. To explore different prosodic groupings of numbers, new digit forms were distributed. The group also discussed new naming conventions to facilitate the sorting process. In order to standardize file names, existing files will be modified to have equal lengths. Similar changes will be made to speaker identification tags. Additionally, files will include information specifying the channel, microphone, and broadcaster details. PhD F suggested recording different meetings with the same group to aid in tasks like summarization, while Professor D advocated for random meeting participants to ensure diversity for acoustical research purposes.",
        "Article": "grad b: We didn't crash we 're not crashing anymore phd c: One , two , three , four , f grad b: and it really bothers me . phd c: Yeah ? professor a: Oh ! Well maybe it 's just , you know , how many t u u u u how many times you crash in a day . phd g: Or maybe it 's once you 've done enough meetings it won't crash on you anymore . professor a: Do we have an agenda ? Liz Liz and Andreas can't sh can't  , can't come . phd g: Did they send , the messages to you about the meeting today ? grad b: I have no idea but I just got it a few minutes ago . grad b: So , does anyone have any a agenda items other than me ? I actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits . professor a: right , so so I I was just gonna talk briefly about the NSF ITR . professor a: and then , you have postdoc f: Can w professor a: I won't say much , but  , but then , you said wanna talk about digits ? grad b: I have a short thing about digits and then  I wanna talk a little bit about naming conventions , although it 's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it . So maybe just talk about it very briefly and take the details to the people who for whom it 's relevant . I 've been but but  , well professor a: Well if we Yeah , we shouldn't add things in just to add things in . grad b: So the only thing I wanna say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set . There are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read . So I won't really know until I go through all the transcriber forms and extract out pieces that are in error . The first is what should we do about digits that were misread ? My opinion is , we should just throw them out completely , and have them read again by someone else . grad b: so it it 's perfectly fine to put a a group together again of errors and have them re - read , just to finish out the test set . postdoc f: Oh ! By throw them out completely ? grad b: the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said . I know I 've done it , where I say say a grad b: What the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction , and they eventually did read the right string , you extract the right string . phd g: Oh , you 're talking about where they completely read the wrong string and didn't correct it ? phd e: Yeah . grad b: So so postdoc f: Well , and s and you 're talking string - wise , you 're not talking about the entire page ? grad b: Correct . grad b: And so the the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said , but then but then the transcript isn't the Aurora test set anymore . phd g: Well how many are how how often does that happen ? grad b: Mmm , five or six times . professor a: Yeah , it 's five or six times out of thousands ? phd c: Yeah . phd g: Yeah , it 's professor a: Yeah , I would , tak do the easy way , phd g: Yeah . professor a: It it 's kinda nice  , wh who knows what studies people will be doing on on speaker - dependent things phd c: Mmm . phd g: So you  , how many digits have been transcribed now ? grad b: Four thousand lines . phd g: Four thousand lines ? grad b: I didn't I didn't compute the average . grad b: And , Jane , I do have a set of forms which I think you have copies of somewhere . grad b: Yeah , I was just wond I thought I had had all of them back from you . And then the other thing is that , the forms in front of us here that we 're gonna read later , were suggested by Liz postdoc f: No , not yet . And so , I just wanted people to , take a quick look at the instructions phd c:   grad b: and the way it wa worked and see if it makes sense and if anyone has any comments on it . Although we could switch it back and tell them always to say \" zero \" or always to say \" O \" . professor a: that 's the only thought I have because if you t start talking about these , you know u tr She 's trying to get at natural groupings , but it there 's there 's nothing natural about reading numbers this way . grad b: But , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , they might say forty - three instead of four three .  , you can With when you space them out they don't look like , forty - three anymore . grad b: and she felt that it 's very , very natural to do that sort of chunking .  it 's a it 's a it 's an interesting problem  , we 've done stuff with numbers before , and yeah sometimes people If you say s \" three nine eight one \" sometimes people will say \" thirty - nine eighty - one \" or \" three hundred three hundred eighty - nine one \" , or I don't think they 'd say that , phd c: Yeah . professor a: but but th grad b: Not very frequently professor a: no grad b: but , they certainly could . grad b: and , since this was something that Liz asked for specifically , I think we need to defer to her . Well , we 're probably gonna be collecting meetings for a while and if we decide we still wanna do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions , grad b: Do something different , professor a: but this is the next suggestion , grad b: yeah . OK , so  e l I guess , let me , get my my short thing out about the NSF .  , I I sent to what I thought we had , in some previous mail , as the right joint thing to send to , which was \" M MTG RCDR hyphen joint \" . professor a: But then I got some sort of funny mail saying that the moderator was going to grad b: It 's That 's because they set the one up at UW postdoc f:  grad b: that 's not on our side , that 's on the U - dub side . grad b: And , I have no idea whether it actually ever goes to anyone so you might just wanna mail to Mari professor a: No no , th I got I got , little excited notes from Mari and Jeff and so on , grad b: and professor a: so it 's grad b: OK , good . grad b: Cuz I had sent one earlier Actually the same thing happened to me I had sent one earlier . The message says , \" You 'll be informed \" and then I was never informed but I got replies from people indicating that they had gotten it , so . Well , anyway , I guess everybody here Are y are you are on that list , right ? So you got the note ? phd g:   professor a: so this was , a , proposal that we put in before on on more more higher level , issues in meetings , from I guess higher level from my point of view .  , and , meeting mappings , and ,  so is i for it was a proposal for the ITR program , Information Technology Research program 's part of National Science Foundation . They 're they 're a lot of them are some of them anyway , are larger larger grants than the usual , small NSF grants , and . So , they 're very competitive , and they have a first phase where you put in pre - proposals , and we we , got through that . grad b: When 's when 's the full proposal due ? professor a: I think April ninth , or something . And they said end of business day you could check on the reviewer forms , phd g: u grad b: is that phd g: Tomorrow . grad b: I guess that 's a good thing cuz that way I got my papers done early . phd g: It would be interesting professor a: So that 's amazing you showed up at this meeting ! grad b: It is . My favorite is was when when when one reviewer says , \" you know , this should be far more detailed \" , and the nex the next reviewer says , \" you know , there 's way too much detail \" . Or \" this is way too general \" , and the other reviewer says , \" this is way too specific \" . Is that right ? That they didn't reject a lot of the pre - proposals ? professor a: Do you know anything about the numbers ? grad b: No . phd g: Gary Strong 's professor a: I phd g: there was a sentence at the end of one of his paragraphs phd e: Yeah . He said the next phase 'll be very , competitive phd e: Very very , phd g: because we didn't want to weed out much in the first phase . professor a: So , you know , maybe they didn't r weed out as much as usual , but it 's it 's usually a pretty But it Yeah . It 's it 's certainly not I 'm sure that it 's not down to one in two or something of what 's left . professor a: I 'm sure it 's , you know grad b: How how many awards are there , do you know ? professor a: Well there 's different numbers of w awards for different size They have three size grants . This one there 's ,  See the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years and that they have a fair number of them .  , and the large ones are , boy , I forget , I think , more than , more than a million and a half , more than two million or something like that . But , I don't remember , but it 's pr probably along the li I I could be wrong on this yeah , but probably along the lines of fifteen or that they 'll fund , or twenty .  when they Do you do you know how many they funded when they f in in Chuck 's , that he got last year ? phd g: I don't I don't know . grad b: I thought it was smaller , that it was like four or five , wasn't it ? professor a: Well they fund phd g: I I 'm professor a: they phd g: I don't remember . professor a: and this time they came up with a middle one , so it 'll there 'll be more of them that they fund than of the big . phd g: If we end up getting this , what will it mean to ICSI in terms of , w wh where will the money go to , what would we be doing with it ? professor a:  . professor a: You know , it i None of it will go for those yachts that we 've talking about . phd g:  Dang ! professor a: well , no ,  it 's u It phd g: It 's just for the research to continue the research on the Meeting Recorder stuff ? professor a: It 's extending the research , right ? Because the other phd g: Yeah . grad b: Yeah it 's go higher level stuff than we 've been talking about for Meeting Recorder . Yeah the other things that we have , been working on with , the c with Communicator  , especially with the newer things with the more acoustically - oriented things are are are are lower level . And , this is dealing with , mapping on the level of of , the conversation of mapping the conversations phd g:   So it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now , or none of us are funded for , so it 's so it 's it would be new . phd g: So assuming everybody 's completely busy now , it means we 're gonna hafta , hire more students , or , something ? professor a: Well there 's evenings , and there 's weekends , and  . Yeah , there there would be there would be new hires , and and there there would be expansion , but , also , there 's always for everybody there 's there 's always things that are dropping off , grants that are ending , or other things that are ending , so , phd g: Right . professor a: But but there definitely would be new new new , students , phd g: I see . grad b: Are there any students in your class who are expressing interest ? professor a: not clear yet . professor a:  we got we have yeah , two of them are two in the c There 're two in the class already here , and then and and , then there 's a third who 's doing a project here , who ,  But he he he won't be in the country that long , grad b:   professor a: Actually there is one other guy who 's looking that that 's that guy , Jeremy ? I think .  professor a: Anyway , yeah that 's that 's all I was gonna say is that that that 's you know , that 's nice and we 're sorta preceding to the next step , and , it 'll mean some more work , you know , in in March in getting the proposal out , and then , it 's , you know We 'll see what happens . It just ,  we 've been cutting up sound files , in for ba both digits and for , doing recognition . And Liz had some suggestions on naming and it just brought up the whole issue that hasn't really been resolved about naming . So , one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length so that sorting is easier . grad b: same number of characters so that when you 're sorting filenames you can easily extract out bits and pieces that you want . And I don't think we have so many meetings that that 's a big deal just to change the names . So that means , instead of calling it \" MR one \" , \" MR two \" , you 'd call it \" MRM zero zero one \" , \" MRM zero zero two \" , things like that . postdoc f: But , you know , when you , do things like that you can always as long as you have  , you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string . postdoc f: You know , so \" zero zero two \" grad b: Alright , postdoc f: Yeah . grad b: so we we have th we 're gonna have the speaker ID , the session , information on the microphones , postdoc f: Yeah , well , your example was really grad b: information on the speak on the channels and all that . postdoc f: i grad b: And so if each one of those is a fixed length , the sorting becomes a lot easier . So like , the NSA meeting lengths , all filenames are gonna be the same length as the Meeting Recorder meeting names ? grad b: Yep . And as I said , the it 's we just don't have that many that that 's a big deal . grad b: And so , at some point we have to sort of take a few days off , let the transcribers have a few days off , make sure no one 's touching the data and reorganize the file structures . postdoc f: I I would think though that the transcribe the transcripts themselves wouldn't need to have such lengthy names . postdoc f: So , you 're dealing with a different domain there , and with start and end times and all that , and channels and stuff , grad b: Right . So the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names , postdoc f: so , it 's a different set . grad b: So for for m the meetings we were thinking about three letters and three numbers for meeting I Ds .  , for speakers , M or F and then three numbers , For ,  and , that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth and keep it consistent . We want some way of specifying , more than looking in the \" key \" file , what channel and what mike . grad b: that 's gonna become especially important once we start changing the microphone set - up . We have some new microphones that I 'd like to start trying out , once I test them . professor a: since we have such a short agenda list I guess I wi I will ask how how are the transcriptions going ? Yeah . postdoc f: The the news is that I 've I  s So in s  So I 've switched to Start my new sentence . I I switched to doing the channel - by - channel transcriptions to provide , the  , tighter time bins for partly for use in Thilo 's work and also it 's of relevance to other people in the project . And , I discovered in the process a couple of of interesting things , which , one of them is that , it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this , using an interface that has so much more complexity to it . And I and I wanted to maybe ask , Chuck to help me with some of the questions of efficiency . Maybe I was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run may be to give them single channel parts and then piece them together later .  , so it 's like , I I know that I can take them apart and put them together and I 'll end up with the representation which is where the real power of that interface is . postdoc f: And it may be that it 's faster to transcribe a channel at a time with only one , sound file and one , set of of , utterances to check through . I thought that that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than than , the the other transcription , thing was that that we were using the mixed file . But , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have a a choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap , which means that you 're not tightly , tuning the individual parts th of that overlap by different speakers . postdoc f: So someone may have only said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap . postdoc f: And for purposes of of , things like well , so things like training the speech - nonspeech segmentation thing . postdoc f: And w and w and , you know , is a It would be wonderful if , it 's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that but , you know , I 've th the So , I I don't know exactly where that 's going at this point . But m I was experimenting with doing this by hand and I really do think that it 's wise that we 've had them start the way we have with , m y working off the mixed signal , having the interface that doesn't require them to do the ti  , the time bins for every single channel at a t  , through the entire interaction . postdoc f: I did discover a couple other things by doing this though , and one of them is that , once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber . postdoc f: because when it 's a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap . And if we 're gonna study types of overlaps , which is what I wanna do , an analysis of that , then that really does require listening to every single channel all the way through the entire length for all the different speakers . Now , for only four speakers , that 's not gonna be too much time , but if it 's nine speakers , then that i that is more time . So it 's li you know , kind of wondering And I think again it 's like this it 's really valuable that Thilo 's working on the speech - nonspeech segmentation because maybe , we can close in on that wi without having to actually go to the time that it would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish through every single meeting .  especially if they 're really short and they 're not very loud and so it it can it it will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them , so . Well so then then , maybe the answer is to , listen especially densely in places of overlap , phd e: Yeah . postdoc f: just so that they 're they 're not being overlooked because of that , and count on accuracy during the sparser phases . postdoc f: Cuz there are large s spaces of the That 's a good point . I I think it 's really interesting data to work with , I have to say , it 's very enjoyable .  , you 're you 're you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , I assume , phd c: Is true . postdoc f:  professor a: and phd c: I haven't results , eh , yet professor a: Yeah . phd c: but , eh , I I 'm continue working with the mixed signal now , after the the last experience . phd c: And and I 'm tried to to , adjust the to to improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , I I implement . phd c: But I have problem because , eh , I get , eh , eh , very much harmonics now . phd c: harmonic possi possible harmonics , eh , and now I 'm I 'm I 'm trying to to find , eh , some kind of a ,  of h of help , eh , using the energy to to distinguish between possible harmonics , and and other fre frequency peaks , that , eh , corres not harmonics . And , eh , I have to to talk with y with you , with the group , eh , about the instantaneous frequency , because I have , eh , an algorithm , and , I get , mmm , eh , t t results similar results , like , eh , the paper , eh , that I I am following . But , eh , the the rules , eh , that , eh , people used in the paper to to distinguish the harmonics , is doesn't work well . phd c: And I I I I not sure that i eh , the the way o to ob the way to obtain the the instantaneous frequency is right , or it 's it 's not right . If if if ,  If I don't have enough time and y you wanna discuss with someone else some someone else besides us that you might want to talk to , might be Stephane . phd c: and , professor a: Yeah , but phd c: they nnn they they they didn't phd e: I 'm not too experienced with harmonics professor a: I see . phd c: they think that the experience is not enough to phd e: and phd g: Is is this the algorithm where you hypothesize a fundamental , and then get the energy for all the harmonics of that fundamental ? phd c: No , no it 's No No . phd g: And then hypothesize a new fundamental and get the energy professor a: Yeah , that 's wh phd c: No . phd c: And The algorithm said that , eh , if you if you change the the the , eh , nnn the X - the frequency \" X \" , eh , using the in the instantaneous frequency , you can find , eh , how , eh , in several frequencies that proba probably the the harmonics , eh , professor a:  - huh . phd c: the errors of peaks the frequency peaks , eh , eh , move around these , eh eh frequency harmonic the frequency of the harmonic . And , eh , if you if you compare the the instantaneous frequency , eh , of the of the , eh , continuous , eh , eh , filters , that , eh that , eh , they used eh , to to to get , eh , the the instantaneous frequency , professor a:   phd c: it probably too , you can find , eh , that the instantaneous frequency for the continuous , eh , eh the output of the continuous filters are very near . phd c: And professor a: It 's it 's it 's I haven't worked with that either so I 'm not sure The way the simple - minded way I suggested was what Chuck was just saying , is that you could make a a sieve . professor a: Let 's let 's hypothesize that it 's this frequency or that frequency , and and , maybe you maybe you could use some other cute methods to , short cut it by by  , making some guesses , phd c: Yeah . professor a: but but    , I would ,   you could make some guesses from ,  from the auto - correlation or something but but then , given those guesses , try , only looking at the energy at multiples of the of that frequency , and and see how much of the take the one that 's maximum . phd g: Do you hafta do some kind of , low - pass filter before you do that ? phd c: I don't use . phd g: Or phd c: But , I I know many people use , eh , low - pass filter to to to get , eh , the pitch . phd g: But i But the harmonics are gonna be , I don't know what the right word is .  , they 're gonna be dampened by the  , vocal tract , right ? The response of the vocal tract . professor a: Yeah ? phd c: Yeah ? phd g: And so just looking at the energy on those at the harmonics , is that gonna ? professor a: Well so the thing is that the This is for , a ,  phd g: I m what you 'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract . professor a: But ,  but I but but I don't know that you need to grad b: Open wide ! professor a: but I don't need you know if you need to get rid of it .  that 'd that 'd be nice but I don't know if it 's ess if it 's essential .  ,  cuz I think the main thing is that , you 're trying phd g:  - huh . professor a: wha what are you doing this for ? You 're trying distinguish between the case where there is ,  where where there are more than  , where there 's more than one speaker and the case where there 's only one speaker . professor a: So if there 's more than one speaker ,  yeah I guess you could I guess yeah you 're so you 're not distinguished between voiced and unvoiced , so so , i if you don't if you don't care about that phd c: Yeah . professor a: See , if you also wanna just determine if you also wanna determine whether it 's unvoiced , then I think you want to look look at high frequencies also , because the f the fact that there 's more energy in the high frequencies is gonna be an ob sort of obvious cue that it 's unvoiced . professor a: But , i i   i i but , other than that I guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon . And if you looked at the low frequencies , yes the higher frequencies are gonna there 's gonna be a spectral slope .  that 's that 's w phd c: I will prepare for the next week eh , all my results about the harmonicity and will will try to come in and to discuss here , because , eh , I haven't enough feeling to to u many time to to understand what happened with the with , eh , so many peaks , eh , eh , and I I see the harmonics there many time but , eh , there are a lot of peaks , eh , that , eh , they are not harmonics . phd c: I have to discover what what is the the w the best way to to to c to use them professor a: Well , but yeah I don't think you can  you 're not gonna be able to look at every frame , so  I  I I really I I really thought that the best way to do it , and I 'm speaking with no experience on this particular point , but , my impression was that the best way to do it was however you You 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . However you 've come up you with your candidates , you wanna see how much of the energy is in that phd c: Yeah . And , if it 's voiced , I guess so so y I think maybe you do need a voiced - unvoiced determination too . professor a: and the ,  e the fraction of the energy that 's in the harmonic sequence that you 're looking at is relatively low , then it should be then it 's more likely to be an overlap . This this is the idea the idea I I I had to to compare the the ratio of the the energy of the harmonics with the eh , with the , eh , total energy in the spectrum and try to get a ratio to to distinguish between overlapping and speech . professor a: But you 're looking a y you 're looking at Let 's take a second with this .  , you 're looking at f at the phase derivative , in in , what domain ?  this is this is in in in in bands ? Or or phd c: No , no , no . professor a: Just just overall phd c: It 's a it 's a o i w the band the band is , eh , from zero to to four kilohertz . And I I ot I professor a: And you just take the instantaneous frequency ? phd c: Yeah . to FFT to to obtain the or to study the harmonics from from the spectrum directly , professor a: Yeah . And another another algorithm I have is the in the instantaneous frequency , based on on on the FFT to to to calculate the the phase derivate in the time . phd c: But , eh , in m i in my opinion the the the instantaneous frequency , the the the behavior , eh , was th it was very interesting . Because I I saw eh , how the spectrum concentrate , eh , professor a: Oh ! phd c: around the the harmonic . But then when I apply the the rule , eh , of the in the the instantaneous frequency of the ne of the continuous filter in the the near filter , the the rule that , eh , people propose in the paper doesn't work . professor a: But the instantaneous frequency , wouldn't that give you something more like the central frequency of the you know , of the where most of the energy is ?  , I think if you Does i does it Why would it correspond to pitch ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: When first I I calculate , eh , using the FFT , postdoc f: Di - digital camera . professor a: Oh , so you scale you s you do a a scaling along that axis according to instantaneous phd c: I use Yeah . phd c: eh , when i I I use these these frequency , eh , the range is different , and the resolution is different . phd c: But , eh , they used , eh , a rule , eh , based in the in the because to to calculate the instantaneous frequency , they use a Hanning window . phd c: And , they said that , eh , if these peak are , eh , harmonics , the f instantaneous frequency , of the contiguous , eh w eh eh , filters are very near , or have to be very near . But , eh , phh ! I don't I I I I don I I and I don't know what is the what is the distance . And I tried to to put different distance , eh , to put difference , eh eh , length of the window , eh , different front sieve , Pfff ! and I I not sure what happened . I 'll probably gonna hafta look at the paper , but which I 'm not gonna have time to do in the next few days , but but I 'm I 'm curious about it . postdoc f: I I did i it did occur to me that this is  , the return to the transcription , that there 's one third thing I wanted to to ex raise as a to as an issue which is , how to handle breaths . So , I wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are . And the reason I ask the question is , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode , the fact that there was some I had the indication from Dan Ellis in the email that I sent to you , phd e: Yeah . postdoc f: and you know about , that in principle we might be able to , handle breaths by accessi by using cross - talk from the other things , be able that in principle , maybe we could get rid of them , so maybe And I was I I don't know ,  we had this an and I didn't couldn't get back to you , phd e: Yeah . postdoc f: but the question of whether it 'd be possible to eliminate them from the audio signal , which would be the ideal situation , professor a: I don't know think it 'd be ideal . professor a: We - See , we 're we 're dealing with real speech and we 're trying to have it be as real as possible phd e: Yeah . postdoc f: Well , except that these are really truly  , ther there 's a segment in o the one I did n the first one that I did for i for this , phd e: Yeah . postdoc f: where truly w we 're hearing you breathing like as if we 're you 're in our ear , you know , and it 's like it 's like professor a: Yeah . postdoc f: I y i  , breath is natural , but not professor a: It is but it is if you record it . postdoc f: Except that we 're we 're trying to mimic Oh , I see what you 're saying . grad b: The P D A might not have to , phd e: No i grad b: but more people than just PDA users are interested in this corpus . grad b: So so mean you 're right postdoc f: OK , then the then I have two questions . grad b: we could remove it , postdoc f: Yeah ? grad b: but I I think we don't wanna w remove it from the corpus , in terms of delivering it because the people will want it in there . If if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might wanna have some method which will allow you to block it , but you it 's real data . You don't wanna b but you don't postdoc f: OK , well professor a: If s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting , even And we have the f  the  the the fan and the in the projector up there , and , this is it 's this is actual stuff that we we wanna work with . postdoc f: because i it basically has a i it shows very clearly the contrast between , speech recognition research and discourse research because in in discourse and linguistic research , what counts is what 's communit communicative . postdoc f: And breath , you know , everyone breathes , they breathe all the time . postdoc f: and the idea is that the transcripts will that get stored as a master there 'll be a master transcript which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses . postdoc f: And the one that 's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts . Discourse side will have this this side over he the we we 'll have a s ch Sorry , not being very fluent here . But , this the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative . So then the then let 's let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths . So what I would r r what I would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically ? Could we get a breath detector ? grad b: Oh , just to save the transcribers time . postdoc f: and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate , to put the boundaries in , to to type it in , i it 's just a huge amount of time . postdoc f: And you wanna be sure it 's used , and you wanna be sure it 's done as efficiently as possible , and if it can be done automatically , that would be ideal . professor a: what if you put it in but didn't put the boundaries ? postdoc f: Well , but professor a: So you just know it 's between these other things , postdoc f: Well , OK . So now there 's there 's another another possibility professor a: right ? postdoc f: which is , the time boundaries could mark off words from nonwords . professor a: Yeah  I 'm think if it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , we are gonna be building up models for these things and these things are somewhat self - aligning , so if so , we i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a \" breath \" or a \" breath - in \" or \" breath - out \" , the models will learn that sort of thing .  , so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are . But that would maybe include a pause as well , phd g: Well , there 's a there 's postdoc f: and that wouldn't be a problem to have it , pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze ? professor a: Yeah , i You know there is there 's this dynamic tension between between marking absolutely everything , as you know , and and and marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods . But if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area , and this might be one like this Although I I I 'd be interested to h get get input from Liz and Andreas on this to see if they Cuz they 've - they 've got lots of experience with the breaths in in , their transcripts . grad b: They have lots of experience with breathing ? phd g: I professor a: Actually Well , yes they do , but we we can handle that without them here . But but but , you were gonna say something about phd g: Yeah , I I think , one possible way that we could handle it is that , you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gonna transcribe , u th they 're gonna transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot . But if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on Morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , don't don't worry about that . phd g: So what we 're saying is , there 's no guarantee that ,  So for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed . So you just somebody can't rely on that data and say \" that 's perfectly clean data \" .  do you see what I 'm saying ? postdoc f: Yeah , you 're saying it 's uncharted territory . phd g: So I would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words . phd e: Yeah , and that 's that that quite co corresponds to the way I I try to train the speech - nonspeech detector , as I really try to not to detect those breaths which are not within a speech chunk but with which are just in in a silence region . phd e: And they so they hopefully won't be marked in in those channel - specific files . professor a: u I I wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes . professor a: See , in a in a way this is a really key point , that for speech recognition , research , e a it 's not just a minor part . In fact , the I think I would say the core thing that we 're trying to do is to recognize the actual , meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful . So it 's critical it 's not just incidental it 's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful . professor a: if we had only linguistically - relevant things if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components , and , we we didn't have noise , we didn't have convolutional errors , we didn't have extraneous , behaviors , and so forth , and moving your head and all these sorts of things , then , actually speech recognition i i isn't that bad right now . professor a: The the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart . I guess , I  , what I was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem ? Because if it were likely that a PDA would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing , so it wouldn't even have to be processed at thi at this computational le well , let me see , it 'd have to be computationally processed to get rid of it , but if there were , like likely on the frontier , a good breath extractor then , and then you 'd have to professor a: But that 's a research question , you know ? And so postdoc f: Yeah , well , see and that 's what I wouldn't know .  so so the thing is it 's it right now it 's just raw d it 's just data that we 're collecting , and so we don't wanna presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations because that 's actually the research that we 're trying to feed . So , you know , an and maybe maybe in five years it 'll work really well , postdoc f: OK . professor a: and and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time , but then we would still want to account for that ten percent , so . postdoc f: I guess there 's another aspect which is that as we 've improved our microphone technique , we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent , recordings , so it 's in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the on the earlier ones . phd g: One of the  , just to add to this one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them . phd g: And so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked , so that you know where the boundaries are . phd g: So  , I don't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation . We don't have to go and search for them to to mark them at all , but , if they 're there while they 're transcribing some hunk of words , I 'd say put them in if possible . postdoc f: OK , and it 's also the fact that they differ a lot from one channel to the other because of the way the microphone 's adjusted <doc-sep>But all all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine . And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message and I have not yet sat down with been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code . professor d: So  so the  , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that  , we do the digit recordings at the end . And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's  meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , then they can run off . It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer  , sets of digits , but  , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , if someone 's on strict time  , less .  , so , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about  , the nature of the data that we are collecting .  @ @ that  , we should have a fair amount of data that is  , collected for the same meeting , so that we can ,  I don't know . Wh - what what were some of the points again about that ? Is it phd f: well , OK , I 'll back up . phd f: at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data and I I talked about this with Jane and Adam , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data  , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us , phd a: Well , great . phd f: And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , phd a: What a deal . grad b: And what 's he interested in , specifically ? phd f: So he 's comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody , grad b:   Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . phd f: But , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time grad b: One offs ? phd f: Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the ,  to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about .  it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . Then I was  , talking to Morgan about some new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to listen to . And in that  , regard , I thought we definitely w will need it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization . phd f: and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting . phd f: But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize , grad b: Yeah . phd f: but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . And then we need a couple that of We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar , grad b:   phd f: like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same . grad b:  professor d: Now , let l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I I don't disagree with that , but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . professor d: As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have  too few people from my point of view . So ,  I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and and  , phd c:   professor d: sure , if we can get more from them , fine , postdoc e:   professor d: but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people . postdoc e: Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . Because I think if you just say an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that that  , it would be useful for for purposes You know . postdoc e: But you know , I think I 've been I 've I I 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . And and the English you 'd have The language models would be really hard to build professor d: Well , you want to i postdoc e: because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a professor d: Well , OK , first place , I I I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I I think that 's what we 're investigating , postdoc e: OK . phd f: It has to be a a pre - existing meeting , like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . professor d: So I was I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors  , and and and  , senior  , d and  , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . The second point is  I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that postdoc e: Oh , oh . postdoc e: No , it 's more a matter of  , proficiency , e e just simply fluency . postdoc e: I deal with people on on campus who I think sometimes people , undergraduates  in computer science  , have language skills that make , you know that their their fluency and writing skills are not so strong . professor d: You 're just talking about postdoc e: Well , e I just think , grad b: We all had the same thought . postdoc e: but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , no problem . professor d: But grad b: Well , I think that ,  I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . And and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , I I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have  , g particularly good English skills . postdoc e: OK , now can I can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that  , there 's there 's this this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together . postdoc e: And if people want to approach  , i so I know e e You know this The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group , professor d:  - huh . postdoc e: but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking  , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data , professor d:   postdoc e: if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in  , i more fluent , more more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing . I postdoc e: Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have  , so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . If you have people who are using English as a as an interlanguage because they they don't  , they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , language model , professor d:  - huh . professor d: Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that professor d: I see . postdoc e: I I 'm I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a a grammar a grammar , basically , that  , wo would be a a possibility . postdoc e: So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , it seems like  , I don't see that there 's an argument professor d:   postdoc e: I 'm I what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , useful for the widest range of of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics . professor d: OK , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get .  , it it I think that if we 're aiming at at  , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK , postdoc e: Yes , that 's fine . And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population . grad b: Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one . professor d: Oh , you age - ist ! grad b: What 's that ? Well , age - ist . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a professor d: They 're they 're yeah , they 're d they 're  assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks . phd f: Cuz  , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? And and  , there there may be a lot more or or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could  , record people there . I think we 'd have a better chance grad b: I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . But if there were such a  it 's a remote possibility , then  , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . phd f: So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware . professor d: Well , the other thing Yeah ,  the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around .  , and grad b: Well , I know that space is really scarce on at least in CS . phd f: But you may not need a separate room , you know , grad b: That 's true . phd f: the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something grad b: True . professor d: Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something . grad b: Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . phd c: But I I I think you need , another portable thing a another portable equipment to to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI . phd c: Eh , if you you want to to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you you need It - it would be eh eh very difficult to to put , eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device . grad b: Yeah , but I think if we if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy . grad b: Right ? That 's very easy , phd c: Ye - Yeah , yeah . professor d: Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . We realized that , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . So , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , the way that you were speaking about with , not having an interlingua and  , these other issues . But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that 's , just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that 's OK too .  , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ?  , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . But what about For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone . phd f: Right , I c I think there 's grad b: And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean . phd f: Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone . postdoc e: Which one did you mean ? professor d: You d You don't ne it doesn't you just need some microphone , somewhere . professor d: but  phd f: use  , but I think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect , professor d: Yeah . phd f: you know , each person who 's interested in  , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . phd f: And So in my case , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . phd f: And so I 'm looking and thinking , \" Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . phd f: And other people need to do that for themselves , h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal professor d: Right . professor d: But I think that I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , \" Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , \" well maybe you don't . professor d: Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that 's good enough to get a  , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . professor d: we we could have a fairly We could just get a DAT machine and phd f: Well , I agree with Jane , though , on the other hand that phd c: Yeah . phd f: So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented . You may say well , \" Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . phd f: But what you what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on  Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . phd f: So I do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . phd f: Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose individual studies , so professor d:  but I I think that the  i We can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . professor d: And so ,  it took quite a while to get that together and to say , \" Oh , we 'll just do it up there , \" phd f: OK . professor d: If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o phd f: So then maybe we should try to bring people here . professor d: I think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here . phd f: that 's that 's OK , so professor d: We 're set up for it . phd f: Yeah , I And I think we can get people to come here , that But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down . professor d: Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food . professor d: Yeah grad b: Should I pursue that ? phd f: Oh , definitely , yeah . grad b: So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer , but I 'll send an email and ask . phd f: I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird grad b: Right . professor d: The the The oth the other h phd f: well , I know , I shouldn't say that . The o the o the other The other thing is , that we we talked about is give to them  , burn an extra CD - ROM . professor d: and give them So if they want a basically and audio record of their phd f: Well , I thought that was I thought he meant , \" Give them a music CD , \" like they g Then he said a CD of the of their speech professor d: Oh . phd f: and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , but You know , I personally would not want a CD of my meeting , grad b: Mmm . Of the meeting ? phd f: but maybe yeah , maybe you 're professor d: If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and  you 'd like phd f: right . professor d: We 're saying , \" Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you , grad b: Yep . professor d: but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless , phd f: Right . professor d: and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . phd a: What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ? postdoc e: Alth phd f: But we might need a little more to incentivize them , that 's all . postdoc e: I hav I have to  raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff , where maybe You know ? professor d: Good point . professor d: So we can so we can postdoc e: We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage . phd f: If It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically , grad b: That 's a good point . phd f: right ? professor d: Although it 's phd f: Otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone . postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right , say \" Yeah , well , I got this CD , and , Your Honor , I \" grad b: Yeah . So that was that topic , and then  , I guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question for grad b: We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have  enough sp room to record meetings . So I  did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving , I I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from  , Broadcast News . phd c: Eleven ? grad b: And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . phd a: Where did you copy it to ? grad b: Well , it 's Abbott . professor d: Sk - It 's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott ? grad b: Tape . phd a: Ah ! grad b: So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files . postdoc e: One thing The good news about that that is that once once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back . professor d: Is it ? postdoc e: it it it The other direction is fast , but this direction is really slow . phd a: Generating a clone ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's a good point . phd a: Oh ! Hunh ! professor d: S postdoc e: Now , what will  Is the plan to g to So stuff will be saved , it 's just that you 're relocating it ?  , so we 're gonna get more disk space ? Or did I ? grad b: No , the the these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable regeneratable postdoc e: OK . grad b: And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something . professor d: Or maybe six ? grad b: The SUN , ha  , takes more disks than the Andatico one did . The SUN rack takes Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . professor d: How many How much phd a: Is there a difference in price or something ? grad b: Well , what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices . I 've been looking at the , Aurora data and , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , SPINE . phd a: And so , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . So , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the CD - ROM type data , the the static data . So I moved that , and then  , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK . I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . professor d: So , but ,  y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , but are we g do we have some other other space now ? grad b: Yep . So , so , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , and that 's probably enough for about four meetings . phd a: OK , I but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we grad b: I don't remember . Yeah ,  we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand . And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , so , you know , we have a couple weeks .  , so , yeah , I think I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk . phd a: So should ,  One question I had for you was , we need we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk . Is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? grad b: We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . grad b: But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it . professor d: OK , @ @ So , then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what Jose has been doing , phd c:  - huh . professor d: so phd c: I have , eh , The result of my work during the last days . Eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the the Meeting Recording project . phd c: But for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh , here 's i is the demonstration of the overlap , eh , problem . phd c: It 's a real problem , a frequently problem  , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time . phd c: Eh , by a moment I have , eh , nnn , the , eh , n I I did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording , with eh , a exact mark . Oh , you did that by hand ? phd c: Heh ? That 's eh , yet b b Yeah , by b b by hand by hand because , eh , eh \" Why . \" grad b: Can I see that ? Can I get a copy ? professor d: Oh . phd c: My my idea is to work phd a: Wow ! phd c: I I I do I don I don't @ @ I don't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because I I I haven't a lot eh , enough time to to to work .  , only just eh , six months , as you know , but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . phd c: Eh but eh , eh , in my opinion , we need eh , eh , a reference eh session to t to to evaluate the the the tool . And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ? phd c: And No , no , with i grad b: Have you done that or are you planning to do that ? phd c: Sorry ? No , I I plan to do that . Darn ! phd c: I plan I plan , but eh , eh , the idea is the is the following . I I will I will eh , talk about eh , in the in the blackboard about the my ideas . phd c: Eh , eh This information eh , with eh , exactly time marks eh , for the overlapping zones eh overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker a a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone .  , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker without any any eh , noise eh , any any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech . And , I need t true eh , silence for that , because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant to eh , classify . The idea is to eh to use eh , I 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . phd c: And my idea is eh , it would be interesting to to have eh , a control set . And my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , silence without eh , any any noise . postdoc e: Which means that we 'd still You 'd hear the grad b: Yeah , fans . phd c: Eh , I  eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , professor d:   phd c: eh , eh , event eh , which , eh , eh , has , eh eh , a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the in the eh speech . grad b: So so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ? professor d:   phd c: Yeah , I have mark in in in in that Not in all in all the the file , grad b:   phd c: only eh , eh , nnn , mmm , I have eh , ehm I don't remind what is the the the the quantity , but eh , I I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones . I have , eh , two hundred and thirty , more or less , overlapping zones , and is similar to to this information , grad b: Whew !   phd c: because with the program , I cross the information of  , of Jane with eh , my my segmentation by hand . phd c: And the the idea is , eh , I I will use , eh , I want My idea is , eh , to eh to classify . phd c: I I need eh , the exact eh , mark of the different , eh , eh , zones because I I want to put , eh , for eh , each frame a label indicating . I I I put , eh , eh , for each frame a label indicating what is th the type , what is the class , eh , which it belong . phd c: Eh , the class you will overlapping speech \" overlapping \" is a class , eh , \" speech \" @ @ the class that 's grad b: Nonspeech . phd a: These will be assigned by hand ? phd c: a I I I ha I h I I put the mark by hand , phd a: Based on the  - huh . phd c: because , eh , my idea is , eh , in in the first session , I need , eh , I I need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , I I will cluster , is is right . Because , eh , eh , if not , eh , I will I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems , grad b: Well , training , and validation . And I I 'd prefer I would prefer , the to to have , eh , this labeled automatically , but , eh , eh , fro th I need truth . So , the difference between the top two , i So so I start at the bottom , so \" silence \" is clear . By \" speech \" do you mean speech by one sp by one person only ? phd c: Speech Yeah . postdoc e: So this is un OK , and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time , or or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or or clicking , overlapping with speech So , that that 's all those possibilities in the top one . phd c: Eh , in the first moment , because , eh , eh , I I have information , eh , of the overlapping zones , eh , information about if the , eh , overlapping zone is , eh , from a speech , clear speech , from a one to a two eh speaker , or three speaker , or is is the zone where the breath of a speaker eh , overlaps eh , onto eh , a speech , another , especially speech . postdoc e: So it 's basi it 's basically speech wi som with with something overlapping , which could be speech but doesn't need to be . phd c: No , no , es especially eh , overlapping speech from , eh , different eh , eh , speaker . Eh professor d: No , but there 's but , I think she 's saying \" Where do you In these three categories , where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ? \" phd c: Ah ! professor d: Which category do you put that in ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , he here I I put eh speech from eh , from , eh , one speaker without , eh , eh , any any any events more . postdoc e: Oh ! professor d: Right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ? phd c: Where ? Where What is the class ? professor d: Which catege which category ? postdoc e: Like a c phd c: No . phd c: For for the by the @ @ no , @ @ because I I I I want to limit the the nnn , the the study . grad b: Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those . phd c: \" Why ? Why ? What 's the reason ? \" because i it 's the first study . In the in the future , the the idea is to to extend the class , phd a: Is is phd c: to consider all the all the information , you you mentioned before professor d: Yeah . phd c: but eh , the the first idea Because eh , I don't know what hap what will happen with the study . i it 's pure phd a: What if there was a door - slam or something ? phd c: No , no , it 's pure silence . professor d: What you Well w I I think what you m I think what you mean is that it 's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises . professor d: Right ? Cuz you 're calling what you 're calling \" event \" is somebody coughing or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises . Right ? phd c: h here yet , yet I I I I I think I I think , eh , there are that some kind of noises that , eh , don't don't wanted to to be in that , eh , in that control set . phd c: But I prefer , I prefer at at the first , eh , the the silence with eh , this eh this kind of the of eh of noise . professor d: Right , it 's  , it 's \" Background \" might be might be a better word than \" silence \" . phd c: And , with this information The idea is eh , eh , nnn , I have a label for for each , eh , frame and , eh with a cluster eh algorithm I and postdoc e: Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . And eh I am going to prepare a test bed , eh , well , eh , a a set of feature structure eh , eh , models . phd c: I have to to test , but eh I phd a: You have your own ? phd c: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Is a modified version of of of a pitch tracker , eh , from , eh , Standar - eh Stanford University in Stanford ? No . phd a: Oh ! What 's it written in ? phd c: Eh , em , I I I don't remember what is the the name of the of the author , because I I have several I have eh , eh , em , eh , library tools , from eh , Festival and of from Edinburgh eh , from Cambridge , eh , and from our department . phd c: And And I have to because , in general the pitch tracker , doesn't work very well and grad b: Bad . This this is And th the idea is to to , eh , to obtain , eh , for example , eh , eh diff eh , eh , different well , no , a great number of eh FEC for example , eh , eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty thirty parameters , eh , for for each one . And in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data grad b: Supervised clustering . phd c: and the second is try to eh , to use some ideas eh , similar to the linear discriminant analysis . phd c: Eh ? Eh , similar , because the the idea is to to study what is the contribution of eh , each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters . What sort of classifier ar ? phd c: Eh , the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is eh is eh , similar , nnn , that the classifier used eh , in a quantifier vectorial quantifier is eh , used to to eh , some distance to to put eh , a vector eh , in in a class different . grad b: Unimodal ? phd c: Is Yeah ? W with a model , is is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity . grad b: So is it just one cluster per phd c: A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network . phd c: But eh what 's the p What is my idea ? What 's the problem I I I I see in in in if you you use the the neural network ? If w when this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm to can test , to can eh observe what happened you you can't you can't eh , eh put up with your hand in the different parameter , grad b: Right , you can't analyse it . phd c: but eh If you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . professor d: Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are . professor d: It 's hard to w w what you It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally . professor d: But it 's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs , especially if they 're all normalized . professor d: Well , this isn't tru if if if you really wonder what different if if phd c: Yeah . phd c: But professor d: Yeah , then a decision tree is really good , but the thing is here he 's he 's not he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth , grad b: Right . professor d: in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what what  phd c: And grad b: Right . professor d: I  , I think the other thing that one  , this is , I think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least See what I 'd I 'd Let me tell you what I would do . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , I would just take a couple . professor d: OK ? Like like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . professor d: OK , so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart . professor d: That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier . professor d: And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @ build a Markov model of some sort  , or or else have features that really are based on  on on some bigger chunk of time . But don't  anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know phd c: Yeah . professor d: what it 's doing , even You know it 's  , I think to know what it 's to have a better feeling for what it 's grad b: Yep . professor d: look at at som some picture that shows you , \" Here 's These things  ,  are offer some separation . \" And , in LPC , the thing to particularly look at is , I think is something like , the residual phd c: Yeah . S postdoc e: Can I ask ? It strikes me that there 's another piece of information  , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . phd c: I eh the the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two eh , w has eh several parts , several p objective professor d:   But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh I think you eh we have eh two main eh objective . And for that , if you don't use , eh , eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames , I think the Ike criterion or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change . When you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh em normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC . But eh eh I I understand that you your objective is to eh classify , to know that eh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone . because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose . phd c: you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm professor d:   phd c: because it 's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . phd c: A model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p  , will be possible the , eh the mark , the change and another another model will @ @ or several models , to try s but eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class . grad b: I 'm I 'm I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you what you said . What what model ? postdoc e:  phd c: Eh , the the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize , eh with eh to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer . phd c: And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net postdoc e: So p phd c: with the information we obtain from this eh this eh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to eh to put the class of each frame . phd c: you you eh , eh have obtained in the first eh , step with the for example , BIC eh , eh criterion compare model postdoc e:   phd c: And You I don't - u professor d: OK , but , I I think in any event we 're agreed that the first step is phd c: i postdoc e: Yeah . professor d: Because what we had before for for  , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps . professor d: So the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps . professor d: Right ? So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these  , in in in in grad b: Features ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , I again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too way too big . professor d: OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth twelfth - order  MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much . All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does . professor d: Whereas I think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things , or three of you have some very fancy display , and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on . professor d: Well , you 'll you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know , phd c: Yeah . professor d: so if you look at Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , and then you look at the third and there 's not and not too much there , you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , phd c: Yeah . professor d: right ? And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than than the other , maybe .  , and  on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , will say how well ,  the low - order LPC model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one . professor d: And so I i again , if you take a few of these things that are are prob  promising features and look at them in pairs , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of \" OK , I now have  , doing a bunch of these analyses , I now have ten likely candidates . phd c: but eh , eh eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to to do that and I would eh like to to know what eh , your opinion . Eh all this study in the f in the first moment , I I w I I will pretend to do with eh eh equalizes speech . grad b: With postdoc e: With what ? With what ? grad b: Right . phd c: Eh , why ? Because eh the spectral distortion is more eh a lot eh clearer , very much clearer if we compare with the PDA . phd c: fff ! Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh is is low . phd c: I don't know eh  i i that eh the the result of the of the study eh with eh with eh this eh this speech , the mix speech eh will work exactly with the eh PDA files . phd c: eh What , I  , what what is the effect of the low ' signal to to to noise relation , you know , eh with professor d: N u We Well , I think I think I think it 's not a it 's not at all unreasonable . It makes sense to start with the simpler signal because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway . professor d: And so , if you can get @ @  again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible  , features look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , and then collect ,  in pairs , and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed with a bigger classifier . professor d: And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much grad b: Right . Because it I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and And don't professor d:  . professor d: That 's well , the It it 's it 's true that it also , it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . phd c: I I I I think that the the eh parameter we found , eh , eh worked with both eh , speech file , postdoc e: That 's good . phd c: but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the PDA speech files . Is eh is not easy eh to to solve , because if you I I I have seen the the the speech file from eh PDA , and s some parts is very difficult because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram . phd c: Is very difficult to apply eh , eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see . Well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are  , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . phd a: Yeah , I maybe this is a dumb question , but w I thought it would be I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA professor d: Nah . phd a: because can't you , couldn't you like use beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ?  grad b: Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one . professor d: Yeah , no , you you 're you 're right grad b: But that 's professor d: that In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one and and so that 's phd a: Is that not allowed with this project ? professor d: well , no , we we don't have any rules , r really . professor d: I think I I think I think it 's it 's it 's a it 's an additional interesting question . professor d: I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one , because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two . professor d: if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . professor d: But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is . postdoc e: There there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the to the PDA , then some of the positional information goes away ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , it it it does , i it d it does , but the the the issue is that that phd a: No , it 's not it 's not that so much as postdoc e: And then , And if they 're on the access on the axis of it , that was the other thing I was thinking . postdoc e: He You mentioned this last time , that that if if you 're straight down the midline , then then the r the left - right 's gonna be different , grad b: Yeah , we hav need to put it on a little turntable , phd c: I I I I I th grad b: and phd a: Well , it 's phd c: Yeah . postdoc e: It seems to me that that it 's not a p  , you know , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated . phd a: I don't I don't know ho phd c: I I I think Sorry . I I I think because the the the distance between the two microph eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is very near . But it 's  from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea to to try to study the binaural eh problem eh , with information , because I I found difference between the the speech from from each micro eh , in the PDA . It - it 's not amplitude , postdoc e: Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves . postdoc e: But I 'm just I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the PDA , phd c: No . postdoc e: so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker . phd c: But professor d: That 's So so i @ @ I think the issue is , \" Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? \" phd a: Right . professor d: If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking , phd c: Yeah . phd a: So it 's sort of like how how confused is it about where the beam is . professor d: Yeah , is there a narrow Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern ? So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's it 's  , multiple people . OK , it just it just seemed to me that  , that this isn't the ideal type of separation .  , I I think it 's I can see the value o professor d: Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them , but  But the thing is just having two mikes If you looked at that thing on on Dan 's page , it was When when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different . phd a: Did - Sorry , b  I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . professor d: You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags . So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in in the lag . professor d: So if at whatever angle you are , at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the in in the cross - correlation value function . phd a: So so if there 's two grad b: And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks . postdoc e: Well , let me ask you , if if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ? phd c: Yeah . The - the Oh , I 'm sorry , postdoc e: No ? professor d: if they 're right next to one another ? phd a: If I was if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking , it wouldn't work . professor d: i i postdoc e: Next next one over n over on this side of the P PDA . postdoc e: Versus you versus you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one . grad b: Or or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either . Yeah , so it 's postdoc e: And so my point was just that it 's it 's gonna be differentially differentially varia valuable . postdoc e: it 's not to say  , I certainly think it 's extremely val And we we humans n n depend on you know , these these binaural cues . professor d: But it 's almost but it 's almost a I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . professor d: There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error  issue . professor d: If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it . and i and if there So it And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side professor d: if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . professor d: So if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough , experience with it to know how postdoc e: Yeah . postdoc e: Oh I 'm not I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . professor d: the other thing you can do  , if  , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA . And then you know then you 're sort of Yeah , then then you pretty much could cover phd a: Once you got two postdoc e: Interesting . phd a: Well what about just doing it from these mikes ? postdoc e: Interesting . phd c: It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the the the separation I I think professor d:  @ @ But - but that 's  , we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study . professor d: But but but the thing is , one of the at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA . phd a: That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , that 's that 's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were were were interested in . professor d: but you know if you can instrument a room , this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ? Some people at at  , yeah , at Brown and and and and at   and at Cape , grad b: Big micro @ @ arrays . phd a: Didn't they have something at Cape ? professor d: they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place grad b: Very finely . professor d: you know p tens of microphones , and and  phd a: Oh ! I saw a demo . professor d: And if you do that then you can really get very nice  kind of selectivity phd a: Yeah . grad b: Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array . phd a: And you could In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody . grad b: It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it . professor d: But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because  , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . And you can't just always go , \" well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up \" . phd a: No , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . phd a: It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA . grad b: But I think professor d: The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D grad b: Yep . professor d: and they communicate with each other ? And then You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that  , basically there wouldn't be any l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . grad b: Though All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , postdoc e: Interesting . grad b: not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of  multi - band as well . postdoc e: Ah ! phd a: I still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then grad b: But I think postdoc e: Well , you could have strips that you stick to your clothing . phd a: Hats ? grad b: In terms of the research th research , it 's really it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .  , I i I i I would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still get to the end of the , birthdays thing there . professor d: So grad b: Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out . grad b: One is , do we need to sign new these again ? postdoc e: Well , it 's slightly different . phd a: Are they new ? postdoc e: Cuz it it 's slightly different . professor d: Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to . grad b: Yeah , I I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed . grad b: I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing . postdoc e: I had to make one grad b: But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . postdoc e: Well , should I  I have some results to present , but  I guess we won't have time to do that this time . But it seems like  the anonymization is  , is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length .  , wha what postdoc e: If if we 're about to wind down , I think what I would prefer is that we  , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and I would like to present the results that I have on the overlaps . @ @ It sounds like u  , there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about . Why don't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly do them , and then and then and then and then and then we grad b: OK , go ahead , Jane . postdoc e: I 'd Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results . postdoc e: And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a you know , more that just a minute . postdoc e: I really do think that , because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself , you and I have discussed it previously , and there are different ways that people approach it , e and I think we should grad b: Alright . We 're we 're just We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it postdoc e: Well , OK . I I 'll give you the short version , but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes . postdoc e: OK , so the the short thing is  , we have  , tape recording  , sorry , digitized recor recordings . postdoc e: Now , in terms of like the transcript , the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name , and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says \" Hey Roger \" or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? grad b: No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping . postdoc e: OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned . Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we don't want postdoc e: I I don't think you understood what I what I said . postdoc e: So  , so in within the context of an utterance , someone says \" So , Roger , what do you think ? \" OK . Then , it seems to me that Well , maybe I  it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that . grad b: We don't we wanna we ha we want the transcript to be \" Roger \" . grad b: Because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that . postdoc e: OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have \" Roger \" be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was \" Roger \" be \" Frank \" , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . postdoc e: Now , if you want to , you know , in some cases , I I I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , actually did do  , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except professor d: Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . postdoc e: And and I cer and I So , the question then becomes one level back .  , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? Well , on the one hand , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions ,  and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like OK . On the other hand , this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name . However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names . postdoc e: So , is it really ,  You know ? grad b: Ugh ! postdoc e: Now , in terms of like so I I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name . Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . And someone who looked professor d: You can go , you know , \" Z \"  , for instance .  , yeah , t it doesn't  , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in in the in the transcript . postdoc e: Yeah , and and in the form that they sign , it does say \" your first name may arise in the course of the meetings \" . So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , \" Frank said this \" and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's \" Frank colon \" . grad b: Yeah , shoot ! professor d: Right ? postdoc e: Yeah , and and you know , even more i i  , immediate than that just being able to ,  Well , it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important . postdoc e: S i You know , \" You raised the point , So - and - so \" , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who \" you \" was . postdoc e: And ac and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , professor d: Yeah , I was too . Well , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . Well , I would sug I I don't wanna change the names in the transcript , phd c: Yeah . grad b: but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point . L let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the , what we 're covering in the meeting .  I realize when you 're doing this that   , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . So I think what would be helpful would be  , i and I 'll I 'll mention this to to Liz and Andreas too , that  , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any any , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll I 'll take the role of organizing them  , into into the agenda , postdoc e: OK . I 've no desire to to make it up , but if if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and  , and i ye yeah , I I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to  , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's There 's  , there 's obviously other things going on . grad b: How will we how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ? Do you know what I 'm saying ? phd a: \" The person who 's doing the transcript \" The IBM people ? grad b: Yeah .  , so so how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ? postdoc e: How do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? grad b: so if I 'm saying in a meeting , \" oh and Bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so \" , postdoc e: How do you mean ? phd a: They 're just gonna write \" Bob \" on it or do @ @ grad b: if you 're doing Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write \" Bob \" . If you 're if you 're doing discourse analysis , postdoc e: They won't be able to change it themselves . professor d: What ar how are they gonna do any of this ? grad b: Yeah , really . postdoc e: Well , I I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them . professor d: they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker  I I phd a: They can't do that . phd c: Yeah , I think grad b: Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity . phd c:  grad b: because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person . I think that My understanding from Yen Is it Yen - Ching ? Is that how you pronounce her name ? professor d:  Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . postdoc e: Oh ,  Yu - Ching ? Yu - Ching ? grad b: y Yu - Ching . postdoc e: was that  , they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down . But , you know , h they won't know these people , so I think it 's Well , they 'll they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified to them So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers . professor d: And it and it may very well be  , since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . professor d: And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . grad b: Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . phd c:  postdoc e: Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes . grad b: The p It 's a good point , \" which what do you do for discourse tracking ? \" phd c: Because y y you don't know to know , eh you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the of the speakers . If if if if someone says , \" what what is Jose doing ? \" and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding . postdoc e: Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit . You know ?  , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , @ @  , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . postdoc e: But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . phd a: But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting Or , you I think said , you know , or s Liz , said something about  , \" is Mari gonna use the equipment ? \"  , how would you say that ? postdoc e: Yeah ? phd a: you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef grad b: if you wanted to anonymize . Yeah , is professor d: \" Is you know who up in you know where ? \" phd a: Yeah . professor d: Right ? Use the phd a: I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , plus we 'd have to tell everybody else . grad b: Yeah , darn !  , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names . phd a: I I think the I think I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . grad b: Well , but that but that as I said , that that that works great for the acoustics , but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse . grad b: Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus their name that they 're being referred to . phd a: I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two grad b: Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and phd a: Why do you have to know his name ? professor d: OK , so suppose someone says , \" well I don't know if I really heard what  , what Jose said . professor d: So  u phd a: Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word \" Jose \" in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded . professor d: And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says \" speaker - five \" there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose , grad b: And that violates our privacy . professor d: and if were gonna do that we might as well give them \" Jose \" say it was \" Jose \" . postdoc e: Now , I I think that we have these two phases in the in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI . postdoc e: And within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not  change the to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to . postdoc e: And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . But I but I don that 's that 's a long way from now and and it 's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how grad b: Making some decisions ? postdoc e: i i it You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the  the audio , and just put in brackets \" speaker - one \" . phd c: the ? ? grad b: You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . professor d: I I think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and postdoc e: But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important . phd a: Well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any  For example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . phd a: If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , you know grad b: Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to still have it useful . grad b: But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names . professor d: She No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said \" Jose \" in their in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it . But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said \" Jose \" that you could replace it with \" speaker - seven \" . But I I also wanna say that people grad b: And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore . professor d: And th and the other thing is if if if Liz were here , what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , postdoc e: Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated . postdoc e: But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time . grad b: I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is . postdoc e: Well it Discourse , you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript . postdoc e: It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , and then you come directly into this confronting this problem . phd a: Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse , postdoc e: So . professor d: maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name . grad b: Did you read the paper on Eurospeech ? postdoc e: We could have little labels . I I I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again , which is everyone has like \" Mister White \" , \" Mister Pink \" , \" Mister Blue \" . Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ? They were di they they had the utterances . phd a: But so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous grad b: Everything was in the same order , but they were the individual syll syllables were played backwards . phd a: What did it sound like ? grad b: People had no difficulty in interpreting it . So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it . professor d: What , what does the speech recognizer care ? grad b: Ah , anyway . professor d: postdoc e: Oh , do we do digits ? Or ? What do we do ? grad b:  OK , we 'll quickly do digits . like as if you were talking like , \" nine eight six eight seven ? \" postdoc e: Well , you know , in the in the one I transcribed , I did find a couple instances I found one instance of contrastive stress , where it was like the string had a li So it was like \" nine eight two four , nine nine two four \" . So they were like looking ahead , postdoc e: And phd a: huh ? postdoc e: Well , they differed .  , I 've I am sort of interested in in And sometimes , you know , I s And I I never know . phd a: Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this postdoc e: and I phd a: They may as well throw in some interesting intonations "

        "Summary": "In recognition of their life-saving efforts during the ongoing pandemic, essential workers were thanked, particularly during Paramedic Services Week. Additionally, members voiced their support for various marginalized groups, including advocating for aboriginals facing police brutality, students experiencing disrupted education, indigenous and rural residents lacking internet access, and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "Article": "bruce stanton (simcoe north, cpc)): Honourable members, I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 15thmeeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  I will remind you that in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not also be connecting by video conference. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up here on either side of the Speaker's chair, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor audio or to interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. For those joining by video conference, I'd like to remind you to leave your microphones on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you need to be on the English channel for interpretation, and if you want to speak French, you should do so on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, please change to the channel for the language that you happen to be using at the time. Should members participating by video conference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their mic and state that they have a point of order. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Over the past few days, we've seen horrific reports of police violence against black men and women south of the border, but these are not isolated incidents or elsewhere problems. They are a result of systems that far too often condone, normalize, perpetrate and perpetuate inequality and injustice against people of colour. The calls for justice, for equality and for peace are found echoed in our communities, because anti-black racism is happening here, everywhere in Canada, every single day. I'm also talking about microaggressions, which many of us may not even see. When it comes to being an ally, I have made serious mistakes in the past, mistakes that I deeply regret and continue to learn from. I want to thank my colleagues, community leaders and fellow Canadians for opening my eyes to what is really going on in our communities and for helping me better understand both privilege and power. I'm not perfect, but not being perfect is not a free pass to not do the right thing. It's not an excuse to not step up, stand up for each other, be an ally. I know that for so many people listening right now, the last thing you want to hear is another speech on racism from a white politician. I'm not here today to describe a reality I do not know or to speak to a pain I have not felt.  Since coming to office, our government has taken many concrete steps to fight anti-black racism, systemic discrimination and injustice across the country. We have made significant investments to enable the Public Health Agency of Canada to provide more mental health services to people who have experienced racism or intergenerational trauma. We have also created the anti-racism secretariat, which has an envelope of $4.6million, to address systemic barriers, such as employment, justice and social participation, that perpetuate injustice. While we've made some progress, there is still so much more to do, because here are the facts in Canada: Anti-black racism is real. Chair, every Canadian who has felt the weight of oppression, every student who has the courage to demand a better future, every person who marches and posts and reads and fights, from Vancouver to Montreal to Halifax, expects more than the status quo. We're ready to work with our opposition colleagues, community leaders and Canadians to make our country a more just and fair place. Racism never has a place in this country, and we will do everything we can to eradicate it from coast to coast to coast. Over the past week, we have all been affected by the heartbreaking killing of George Floyd in the United States. No one should ever have to plead for help while a crime is being committed, ignored by other members of law enforcement.  No one should ever feel unsafe because of the colour of their skin, especially around police officers who have a duty and a responsibility to uphold the law for all. Our nation has benefited immensely from great Canadians who overcame prejudices and discrimination to serve their communities and make Canada a better country: Lincoln Alexander, elected as a Conservative in 1968, was the first black member of Parliament and went on to become the first black cabinet minister; John Ware was born into slavery in South Carolina but, following the American Civil War, was a leading figure in bringing the first cattle to Alberta and spearheading the ranching industry that would become the backbone of the province; Josiah Henson escaped slavery to become a thriving businessman in Ontario; and of course, Viola Desmond challenged segregation in Nova Scotia. Black Canadians throughout history have not just built this nation with their contributions; they have also represented Canada with excellence and pride on the world stage, like Harry Jerome, who represented Canada in three Olympic Games and won a bronze medal in 1964. He would go on to become a teacher in British Columbia, once again serving with excellence to try to make a better world for the next generation. Throughout our history, black Canadians have put their lives on the line for their fellow Canadians, bravely serving around the world in our armed forces. While there are many things we can point to in our history with pride, that is not to say that we have a perfect record, nor that we are immune to the threat of racism or that anti-black racism is just an American problem. Canada has had its own dark episodes of racism that cannot be ignoredsadly, not just in our past. No one should be attacked in their community or targeted on the bus because of the colour of their skin. In a peaceful and free country like Canada, there is absolutely no room for intolerance, racism or extremism of any kind. Millions of people are protesting peacefully across the United States and in Canada, and we must always protect the rights of people who are protesting peacefully and within the law for a just cause and separate them from those who exploit tragedies to commit acts of violence. Chair, that is a powerful message about how each one of us can use our democratic rights to effect change. In a peaceful and free country like Canada, there is absolutely no room for intolerance, racism and extremism of any kind. We are all created in the image and likeness of God, and because of that, we are all equal. Canada is a nation of immigrants that stands on the traditional territories of first nations, Inuit and Mtis people. Waves of newcomers have come to Canada for a better life because our country is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law and fundamental and universal human rights. Everyone comes here because Canada is built on solid values, democratic institutions, and respect for the rule of law, as well as for fundamental, universal human rights. There are those who say that diversity is our strength, and that is true, but it doesn't quite capture the full picture. It is the freedom for people to preserve and pass on their cultural traditions and the opportunity to live in peace with those around them; the freedom to live your life with equality under the law, regardless of your race or ethnic background; and the economic freedom that so many governments around the world deny their people. Together, generations of Canadians who trace their roots back to countries around the world have built Canada to truly the greatest country on earth, the true north strong and free. To ensure that our people remain free, we must continue to fight attacks on our freedoms, including racism and all forms of brutality and injustice in Canada and around the world. As John Diefenbaker said, I am a Canadian...free to speak without fear, free to worship...in my own way, free to stand for what I think right, free to oppose what I believe wrong, free to choose those who shall govern my country. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. At a time of crisis when outrage is overwhelming the caution and fear of disease among thousands of people who, despite everything, take to the streets to express that outrage, we here in politics will have to be careful, once again, about the words we use. Indeed we are particularly inclined to give other people's words a meaning other than the one they would have liked to give them. Today, our dutyand I would say almost our only dutyis to express our solidarity, our sadness, our indignation and our anger, but above alland in saying this, I'm thinking of all my friends and acquaintances in the wonderful black community in Quebec and the UnitedStatesour friendship. Every time we talk about this, a small part of me surfaces, that of the non-practising but unrepentant anthropologist who wants to remind us that races do not exist. It is the frequency of manifestations of certain genetic traits favoured by geography and history, which in turn shape cultures. Racism expresses itself first and foremost through aggression against what is presumed to be the culture of others, difference. I am concerned when anyone suggests that we are all and collectively inclined to engage in systemic discrimination or when anyone claims to be a bulwark of virtue between us and the victims. I believe that the Canadian government is not racist, that the Quebec government is not racist, and that the governments of our municipalities are not racist either. I believe, however, that there may be traces of horrible things left in our institutions that colour our relationships with people of different origins or with people who were here long before us. It should not denounce individuals, but it should encourage us to reread our rules to get rid of what might still be discriminatory in them. We don't play politics at the funeral doors: we gather our thoughts, and let indignation and sadness be expressed. I'm proposing a very concrete measure, which is to give priority and expedited processing to the files of refugee claimantsespecially Haitian, especially black, but also of other originswho have expressed their desire to be part of the Quebec nation by putting themselves on the front line. He has the power and the duty to do so, and if he needs Parliament, let's do it tomorrow or right now. In the meantime, our duty is to stand up for those who are afraid and against those who frighten them. GeorgeFloyd's murder is a grim reminder that anti-black racism still exists and that it hits hard. Anti-black racism isn't only in the UnitedStates; it's here in Canada, too. Systemic racism against blacks, indigenous people and many other visible minorities is alive and well: racial profiling, economic inequality, social inequality, discriminatory hiring, trivialization of violence, excess incarceration, and so on. When the time comes to act, they don't have the courage, they don't have the will to act.  When people around the world saw the killing of George Floyd, it left all of us shaken to our core. It was chilling, the casual violence of anti-black racism, the callous taking of another human being's life. This is just as much a Canadian problem as well, and something that continues to exist across our country. Indigenous people and black people have suffered violence and have been killed at the hands of police here in Canada. I think about Stewart Kevin Andrews, a young indigenous man killed in an interaction with the police in Winnipeg. The anger and frustration are about this: How many more people need to die before there's action? How many more speeches will be made? How many more protests need to happen before something is done? How many more times will people plead to breathe? How many more times will they plead to live? What we're talking about is basic human dignity. How many more voices have to ask, demand, plead, beg for basic human dignity? People are angry. Why do they need to keep on asking? Why do black people, why do indigenous people need to keep on asking to be treated like humans? Why? You know, people are done with pretty speeches, particularly pretty speeches from people in power who could do something about it right now if they wanted to. I'm standing in a hall of power, the chamber of the Commons, with a Prime Minister who has the power not just to say pretty words but to actually do something about this. The Prime Minister of this country has the power to go beyond pretty words and pretty speeches and do something. We're going to have to come up with those solutions together, but there are certainly some things we do know. Martin Luther King said, True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice.  Killer Mike extolled that people should plan, plot, strategize, organize and then mobilize. Cardi B put it this way: Another way for the people to take powerI don't want to make everything political but it is what it isis by voting. I call on the Prime Minister, in this hall of power: If the Prime Minister believes that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending racial profiling in our country? If the Prime Minister believes that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over-policing of black bodies? If the Prime Minister believes, truly believes, that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over-incarceration of black people in this country? If the Prime Minister truly believes that black lives matter, will he commit to ensuring that there are race-based data to make better decisions? Will he commit to ensuring that there's access to education and to health resources? The Prime Minister has the power to do all these things right now. If the Prime Minister truly believes that indigenous lives matter, then similarly the Prime Minister must commit today to ending the racial profiling of indigenous people, the over-policing of indigenous people and the over-incarceration of indigenous people. If the Prime Minister truly believes that indigenous lives matter, the Prime Minister could stop taking indigenous kids to court; the Prime Minister could stop delaying the action on the calls for justice for the murdered and missing indigenous women and girls. If the Prime Minister believes that indigenous lives matter, he could ensure that there's clean drinking water and access to justice and to education and housing right now. People are angry because they're done with pretty speeches from people in power who could do something about it right now. I stand here and want to begin by acknowledging that we are all on the traditional territory of the Algonquin peoples, and again to say meegwetch, on a day like this when we're focusing on something so painful that really is beyond partisanship and that should bind us together as people who say we cannot tolerate racism, not in this country. One is COVID-19 and the other one we've tolerated far too long, which is race-based hatred, hate speech and anti-black racism. I want to do nothing but just chant it in this place until we all stand together and say, Black lives matter. What we are seeing in the murder of George Floyd is exactly as my colleague from the Bloc Qubcois said: George Floyd is not a victim of racism; he is another victim of racism.  The first time a black man was killed when his last words were I can't breathe was in 2014, with Eric Garner. Imagine what she's going through, because George Floyd died on video also saying, I can't breathe, and the people who were stopping him from breathing, his killers, are the police. In George Floyd's murder, at least one killer has been charged, but it doesn't do anything to ease the pain, nor, as my friend from the NDP said, does it quench the thirst for justice, because that's what people are crying out for. I had to look it up because I thought, when was it that the poor young man who was jogging was murdered by the father and son in the pickup truck? He was murdered by a retired policeman and his son in their pickup truck, in February. Breonna Taylor of Louisville was murdered in her own home by cops who thought she might have drugs there. What on earth allows this to keep happening over and over again?  I looked at a site called Just Security and I thought these words from reporter Mia Bloom, who happens to be Canadian, were pretty clear on what puts you at risk of death in the United States of America, but also in Canada: driving while black, jogging while black, reporting while black, bird watching while black, selling lemonade while black can get you killed. I want to go back to the words reporting while black, because this is something else we've seen in the last four days that we've never seen before, which is the deliberate targeting of reporters by police. It seems that, in this place, when we have speeches and pretty words to denounce racism, we do it in a kind of cycle. We talked about the threat to our indigenous brothers and sisters across this country who also face racism on a daily basis. Just within the last day, the report came down on the killing of Dale Culver in Prince George at the hands of the Prince George RCMP. This indigenous young man was 35 years old, and he was pepper-sprayed until he couldn't breathe.  We denounce anti-Semitism when we see anti-Semitic graffiti scrawled on the door of an Ottawa rabbi's home. We denounce it, but can we get to the root of it? As the honourable leader of the Conservative Party mentioned, in recent days we're seeing anti-Asian racism on the increase. We have to acknowledge our privilege and we have to know, as the Prime Minister said, we're not perfect, but it doesn't give us a free pass to ignore that we have to stand up and we have to speak out. I am sitting so close to my friend here, our minister, Ahmed HussenI say your name out loud, but your tweets brought me to tearsthat this fine man faces racism in his own riding, that his three beautiful black boys have people turn away or clutch their purse or they're a little worried when the kids are around. It sounds exactly like what the Prime Minister just called the microaggressions that many of us might not even see. In looking at these things, there is something I want to say, when we look at all these things that are happening and we wonder, what we can do about it. We have to speak out and we have to say that the President of the United States is fomenting hatred and violence and it's shameful and shocking that he would grab a Bible, then use tear gas to clear peaceful protestors on a Washington street so that Donald Trump could pose with a Bible in front of an Episcopal church. The Episcopal Bishop of Washington had this to say, because she is a good ally:     In no way do we support the President's incendiary response to a wounded, grieving nation. In faithfulness to our Saviour who lived a life of non-violence and sacrificial love, we align ourselves with those seeking justice for the death of George Floyd. We must acknowledge and speak up for justice for the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, the report on which languishes a year later. If we're looking for real action, things we can do in this place, I call on us to have an inquiry and an examination to root out white supremacist groups in Canada and identify them for what they are, a terrorist threat in our midst. We must make sure they're not in our police forces, because if there is one thing scarier than a white supremacist with a gun, it's a white supremacist with a gun in uniform. Please, God, we love each other, take care of each other regardless of the colour of our skin, and pray for the United States of America. It's a country being ripped apart, and the ripping and the tearing is being done by people who should at this very time be consoling and leading and inspiring. Pray for each and every one of our beautiful black baby girls and boys, the indigenous baby girls and boys, the Asian kids. bruce stanton): We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15minutes. I'd like to remind honourable members that any petition presented during the meeting of this special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions.  For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificate off at the table once the petition is presented. It's estimated that 74,000 to 121,000 microplastic particles are ingested per person every year. A recent study shows that each washing cycle 120,000 to 730,000 microfibres are shed from clothes and go directly into waste water. Washing machine discharge filters are currently available on the market and greatly reduce the amount of microfibres being released into waste water and thus the environment. This petition is calling on the government to legislate the requirement for all new washing machines to have discharge filters as of 2021 and to provide incentives to all residents of Canada to install discharge filters on current washing machines. Given what we've seen in assisted living homes in this country and the devastation particularly in Ontario and Quebec, the petitioners are asking for the government to look into assisted living, not assisted dying. Chair, it's an honour to rise to present a petition today from a number of constituents calling for the government to act to uphold the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action. There is a call to respect the Wet'suwet'en territory and to dismantle RCMP exclusion zones. I am particularly pleased to note that the nation-to-nation talks called for by petitioners between the Wet'suwet'en and the federal and provincial governments have taken place. I would ask members who have presented petitions here in person in the House if they would be so kind as to bring their petitions to the table. patrick weiler (west vancouversunshine coastsea to sky country, lib.): Mr. Chair, I continue to be amazed by how the communities throughout my riding have stepped up to support our most vulnerable at our time of crisis. Dedicated individuals immediately and organically mobilized the Sunshine Coast community task force to coordinate local government, non-profit and business efforts to provide critical services to the community. Social enterprises banded together to form the Sunshine Coast food service response, which provides ready-made meals and donates to food banks. Persephone Brewing and others deliver groceries to at-risk customers both on the coast and on isolated islands. The 101 Brewhouse + Distillery and Bruinwood Distillery quickly retooled their business to supply much-needed hand sanitizer to local hospitals and other front-line workers. COVID-19, like all crises, has highlighted true leadership in our society, and I am grateful for what they and all of our health care workers do every day to get us through this. Chair, the Prime Minister and his cabinet have shown they're unwilling to put the protection and safety of Canadians ahead of political interests. Either purposely or because of ignorance, he left out the fact that doing so is a criminal offence with a five-year prison sentence. The Minister of Public Safety said he wouldn't target hunters, but then he went ahead and banned numerous bolt-action hunting rifles and made owning a shotgun a criminal offence. They have ignored our rampant drug crisis, and they have weakened sentences for serious crimes, all while saying they take these issues very seriously. Today they tell us they are banning a new Liberal-invented type of firearm, a military-style assault rifle. The Liberals would rather make people afraid of hunters, farmers and sport shooters than deal with the real issues like drugs, gangs, illegal smuggling and crime. Chair, it is in our most difficult moments when we truly see stunning displays of human spirit and generosity. On that note, today I wish to recognize the work of the Humber River Hospital in my riding of Humber RiverBlack Creek and to congratulate them on the success of their Humber front-line support fund and PPE drive. Not only have they been on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic keeping our residents safe and healthy, but thanks to the generosity of those both in my riding and beyond, the Humber River Hospital has raised over $1 million and received over 400,000 pieces of personal protective equipment. This will be invaluable to the hospital as they continue to work with us and fight the good fight to keep us all healthy. I thank all those brave workers at the hospital, and I thank those generous individuals who have donated to this important cause. member for AbitibiTmiscamingue, Mr.Lemire, to take the floor. sbastien lemire (abitibitmiscamingue, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. For several years, he had been using his fight against cancer, which he led with the help of natural products only, to ensure cancer services and care were improved, particularly in regions far from major centres. Mayor of Preissac, in the RCM of Abitibi, StephanLavoie passed away yesterday. I would like to extend my condolences to his wife, Anabelle, to his entire family and especially to his daughter, Astrid, who is only 20months old. Through his humanism, StephanLavoie was a warrior, a visionary and a great source of inspiration for all of us. My thoughts also go out to the citizens of Preissac, to whom he leaves a dynamic legacy, and to the leaders of the Abitibi community. In our first conversation, he said to me, and I hope the House will echo it forever, that all of our decisions must be made with our children in mind. anthony housefather (mount royal, lib.): It is with great sadness that I rise today to pay tribute to Tristan Roy, after his tragic passing exactly two weeks ago. Born in Saint-Fabien-sur-Mer, Tristan became a pillar of the MontRoyal community in1997 when he bought the old MontRoyal newspaper. When the city's oldest newspaper, the TMR Weekly Post ceased operations, Tristan registered the name and renamed his newspaper the TMR Poste de Mont-Royal. He created a truly bilingual newspaper, ensuring that TMR residents could receive their news in both French and English. I join Mayor Philippe Roy and the members of the town council in offering our sincere condolences to Tristan's wife, Anne-Marie, his daughter, Aril, and his son, Lancelot. We all considered Tristan to be a friend, an example of what a good journalist and editor should be and could be. richard lehoux (beauce, cpc): Mr.Chair, if you didn't already know, people from Beauce are proud. There is Marie-PhilipPoulin of Beauceville, who was named the best female hockey player in the world earlier this year, or AntonyAuclair of Notre-Dame-des-Pins. AntonyAuclair said, in a CBC article, that Beauce had prepared him for his arrival in the NFL. There is also GuillaumeCouture, from Sainte-Marie, who made his mother very proud, and everyone from Beauce indirectly, on the program Les Chefs again last night. It is this same pride that I see throughout the region, with companies like Revtech Systmes, in Saint-Joseph-de-Beauce, or PuriHaze, in Sainte-Marie, which have invented robots to decontaminate spaces. There are also local purchasing initiatives such as the #onlaici campaign by the Nouvelle-Beauce chamber of commerce and industry or Achetons beauceron, by the Saint-Georges chamber of commerce. Chair, our government has shown leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic by ensuring that Canadians remain safe and get the financial assistance they need. The Canada emergency business account and the Canada emergency wage subsidy ensure that the economy is ready to start up post-pandemic. Seniors received top-ups to the OAS and GIS, and families, the child care benefit. All of these measures are helping thousands of seniors and low-income families in my riding of Don Valley East. I want to particularly thank Saravanaa Bhavan and Happy Pops for donating food and frozen treats to our superhero front-line workers at local hospitals. Chair, even though this year's festivities for Italian Heritage Month will be done differently, the same spirit and vitality exists throughout virtual events happening across the country. Virtual events have seen Italian Canadians, through their generosity, raise over $1 million to help Italy during COVID-19. The Italian Canadian story remains one of passion, an adopted homeland filled with hard work, sacrifice and optimism. Chair, as communities begin to ease restrictions, I remain mystified that, according to this government, Parliament is not an essential service. We in the opposition have been long calling for the return of Parliament, which would be possible while still maintaining public health guidelines. While the work we do in our constituencies is incredibly important, it is equally important to bring those voices back to Ottawa to debate, to question and to hold the government to account. The role of the opposition is crucial now more than ever when billions of dollars are being spent with little oversight. Chair, I would like to take a moment to highlight displays of generosity in my riding of Brampton East.  Khalsa Aid has been providing food supplies with the help of Sperenza Banquet Hall, which has graciously provided the space to run a province-wide campaign out of Brampton East. Care4Cause has sent hundreds of prepared meals on a weekly basis to Good Shepherd Ministries to lessen their load. Navraj Brar at Pharmasave has offered free care packages to health care workers and hand sanitizer to the Peel Regional Police. Aujla Salon and Spa has partnered with GlobalMedic to help deliver over 10,000 pounds of food to local food banks. I would also like to point out the heroic efforts of our truck drivers, taxi drivers, grocery store clerks, nurses, doctors, paramedics and countless other front-line heroes. Thank you to everyone in Brampton East who has stepped up for their neighbour in their time of need. You are setting a great example of the kind of progress we can make as Canadians when we come together and support each other. bruce stanton): We'll now go to the honourable member for WellingtonHalton Hills, Mr. They tried to give the PMO the control over this House in motion 6, and yesterday's report confirms that they rigged the leaders debate in their favour in the last election. Parliament sat through two world wars, the October crisis and previous pandemics and it survived the test, but not now. Parliament and this House of Commons with its full powers needs to reopen and it needs to reopen now. Chair, these past few months have been tremendously difficult for so many Canadians: sickness, losing loved ones, job losses, economic hardships, loneliness and isolation. It is in these times of suffering and adversity that we have seen Canadians coming together to support each other and that brings us hope. Mosques, churches, synagogues and gurdwaras have all answered the call to help their communities. Whether it's providing meals to the hungry, clothing for the cold, or technology for those who need it most, these actions are true reflections of the kindness and generosity that Canadians are known for. While there are too many groups to mention them all, I want to thank Vikas Sharma and Care4Cause out of Brampton for the meals that they have been providing their community in that area and across the GTA. This group and thousands of others like it across the country are working tirelessly to ease the suffering of others and help those in need. Chair, I rise today in honour of National Indigenous History Month to speak truth about a history of racism in Canada that was built on the wrongful dispossession of lands from indigenous people and controlled through the use of police-state violence that has resulted in a loss of life, freedom, respect and dignity. Even today we continue to observe this reality in my very own city where we witnessed the killing of three indigenous youth by police in a span of 10 days this past April. Canadians are rising from coast to coast demanding this of all of us and sending a clear message that we must address systemic racism in all of its forms to ensure justice for all. julie vignola (beauportlimoilou, bq): Mr.Chair, Canada Post is literally not delivering the goods. But the postal service is an essential service, and even more so today because everything is done online, even local shopping. The current crisis partly explains the congestion, but it is mainly due to the fact that Canada Post forgot to join the 21stcentury. In the immediate term, Canada Post must deal with the delays, and to do so, it needs the help of the Government of Canada. As I said, the postal service is an essential service, and it's time to give it the importance this status imposes. This is a result of the temporary collapse in demand for our most valuable commodity and the one that contributes the most to our GDP, our balance of trade, and whose taxes support the social programs Canadians enjoy, $108 billion in GDP, $8 billion per year in government revenues, $77 billion in trade surplus. It is a rude blow to hard-working professionals who soldier past negligent government policies that have left a stain on another generation of western Canadians. We're talking about an industry here that directly employs over 200,000, including 11,000 indigenous Canadians. Bad policy cannot permanently erase the work, the hope and the pride of forward thinkers and doers, and their efforts to continue building a great country. Chair, today I want to give a special thank you to the health care workers at Victoria General Hospital, who are serving patients in our community here in Winnipeg South. Every day, doctors, nurses and staff work selflessly to take care of those in our community who need it most. Whether it's by keeping seniors connected with their families by using iPads or making sure that patients go home with a special care package, staff at the Vic are doing extraordinary work to make this difficult time just a little bit easier. I would also like to give a big shout-out to our wonderful small businesses in Winnipeg South that continue to show their appreciation by preparing meals for the hard-working staff at the Vic. Folks in our community continue to show what it means to be exemplary Canadians, and it is a great honour to represent them. andrew scheer: Mr.Chair, the staff of long-term care facilities for seniors are showing exceptional courage and dedication. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, like all Canadians, I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary work that the Canadian Armed Forces are doing in long-term care facilities in Quebec and Ontario. We will continue to support them, but we know that having military personnel in our long-term care facilities isn't a long-term solution. Chair, now that Bell Canada has decided to partner with Ericsson to deliver its 5G network, the Liberals will undoubtedly ban Huawei, but the Liberal inaction on Huawei is just another example of this government's weak leadership. Instead of deciding for himself a year ago, the Prime Minister is forcing the business community to make the decision for him. Why couldn't the Prime Minister have shown some backbone and banned Huawei a year ago? right hon. Chair, our approach every step of the way has been to listen to experts, to work with allies and to listen to the counsel of our security and intelligence community, which has been looking into this issue. We know we need to make sure that Canadian businesses, Canadians and Canadian infrastructure are protected at the same time as we remain competitive in the world. andrew scheer: The fact of the matter, Mr Chair, is that it hasn't. The former public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, promised in this House over a year ago that an answer on Huawei would be coming. Here we are, it's June 2, 2020, and they still haven't made a decision. Chair, the President of the Treasury Board wrote to cabinet last week and said that transparency is important even in a time of crisis. She's refusing to tell us how much of a bonus she gave to the departing head of the Canada Infrastructure Bank. At a time when Canadians are struggling, it is disgusting that the Liberals are paying out bonuses to someone who accomplished nothing. Will the Prime Minister have a little respect for taxpayers and tell us exactly how much of a bonus the CEO of the Canada Infrastructure Bank received? right hon. Chair, the mandate of the Canada Infrastructure Bank is to find innovative ways to finance some of Canada's biggest infrastructure projects by leveraging private capital. The remuneration range of the former CEO has been in the public domain for more than two years. The bank is moving into its next phase of development, now under the leadership of the new board chair, Michael Sabia, and will play an important role in the recovery when the time comes. Chair, as I said, the remuneration range of this former CEO has been in the public domain for more than two years. In regard to further payments, we do not comment on personal HR and financial information of individuals in government. The Canada Infrastructure Bank was a Liberal scheme designed to protect the investments of private investors and put all the risk onto taxpayers. They might try to claim that it's arm's length and that they can't divulge this information, but we know that Minister Champagne personally intervened in the decision regarding the bonus of the Canada Infrastructure Bank's CEO. Chair, five years ago, when we first got elected, we had to turn around the underinvestment that Stephen Harper's Conservatives had made in infrastructure across the country. Even during the depths of the 2008 recession, the investments they made were for things like doorknobs and signs. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, well before 1867, in what became Quebec, in New Brunswick, in Acadia, in Ontario and in the west, lay the seeds of what later became the provinces of Canada and Quebec. It can therefore be inferred that Canada is a creature of the provinces and that the provinces are not creatures of Canada. Could the Prime Minister read his answer to this question: who pays for the health transfers to the provinces? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we have a country with a number of levels of government working together to serve Canadians. In times of crisis, but also in good times, Canadians expect that their governments will work together to provide the services and the care that they need. yves-franois blanchet: Let me remind the Prime Minister that all the provinces and Quebec are asking for increased and recurring health transfers that are unconditional and sustainable. Who pays for the all-too-meagre benefits made available to the seniors of Quebec and Canada? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we have worked with Quebec and the other provinces to make sure that we invest in health transfers. We have made transfers of $500million, that's halfabillion dollars, because of the recent COVID-19 crisis. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, the Conservatives have backtracked on the wage subsidy, and I congratulate them for that. Who pays for the part of the wage subsidy program that will be going into the coffers of the Liberal Party of Canada? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, since this crisis began, we have made investments to protect jobs and workers, including accountants, human resources managers and receptionists. We are in the process of ensuring that people with all kinds of jobs in all kinds of organizations will be able to keep those jobs. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, it is comforting to know that they are a little richer now, but some companies are under threat because the Liberal Party is a little richer. Who is going to pay for the fact that one company has been chosen by a closed call for tender? One company has been awarded a private contract, probably a foreign multinational, probably for 2021, while we are perfectly capable of doing the work in Quebec and in Canada. Who is going to pay for this gift to a private company that will be doing the Government of Canada's work? right hon. We are in the process of helping workers and helping Canadians by means of measures like the Canada emergency response benefit, the Canada emergency wage subsidy and with the assistance to companies, We will continue to do what we must do to help workers all across the country so that we can come out of this crisis together. yves-franois blanchet: Fundamentally, my impression was that, in a crisis, civil society turns to the state to find and implement solutions. I see that, in this case, and in all its operations, the Government of Canada takes money, about 20% of which comes from Quebec, and gives it to a private company, possibly a foreign company, so that it can tell us what will happen, although the first wave will have come and gone for a year already. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, Canadians expect their government to look after their health and the health of the economy. We are here for workers, we are here for families, we are here for our seniors and for our students. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, as I see it, the Prime Minister is contracting out his job with taxpayers' money, a part of which is going into his party's bank account for the next election. Is that the only explanation of his role he has for the residents of Quebec, a role that is currently protected by a crisis? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, all across the country, including in Quebec, people are worried about their jobs because of the crisis that the pandemic is causing. We are providing a wage subsidy to organizations and to companies to ensure that people will receive their paycheques in order to support their families and pay their rent. The Prime Minister has the power to do something about the anti-black racism that Canada is faced with. Will the Prime Minister end racial profiling in Canada against black people once and for all? right hon. Chair, this government was the first government to recognize anti-black racism, systemic discrimination and unconscious bias and to take concrete actions against them in the context of the UN International Decade for People of African Descent but also in the context of a country that stands up for human rights and protects everyone. We have made significant steps forward, but there is so much to do, and I look forward to working with all members in this House to do just that. Chair, our justice system unfairly targets in many situations racialized Canadians, including indigenous Canadians and black Canadians. We know we need to improve our justice system and rates of incarceration and we will work on it. jagmeet singh: Will the Prime Minister end the over-policing and over-incarceration of black and indigenous people? right hon. Chair, systemic discrimination means that people of colour are at greater risk of being incarcerated than others when facing negative outcomes in the justice system. jagmeet singh: Will the Prime Minister make sure Canada is collecting disaggregated data on the impacts of COVID-19 on racialized people, particularly indigenous and black people? right hon. Chair, not just on COVID-19 but on all ranges of data, we've made investments over the past years to Statistics Canada so that they are better able to collect data in a disaggregated fashion. Disaggregated data will help, and we're working with provinces on the COVID-19 data. Will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over-incarceration, over-policing and racial profiling of indigenous people? right hon. Yes, we need to work to ensure that the rates of incarceration for indigenous people and for racialized Canadians are reduced. There are many measures we're working on to move forward to make our justice system fairer, to reduce systemic discrimination and eventually to eliminate it. I asked the Prime Minister if he will commit to stop taking indigenous kids to court, and if he will stop delaying the response to the murdered and missing indigenous women and girls calls for justice. We have been working over the past year with partners on the ground to formulate the measures and the response that needs to move forward. Many of those partners over the past months have been engaged in keeping their communities safe and working hard on that, and that has delayed the putting out of the report. jagmeet singh: Will the Prime Minister stop taking indigenous kids to court when it comes to indigenous child welfare? right hon. Chair, we agree that we need to compensate kids and indigenous peoples who have suffered harm at the hands of our child and family services over the past decades and we will do that. jagmeet singh: Will the Prime Minister commit to not just pretty words but real action ensuring that all indigenous communities have access to clean drinking water? right hon. Chair, the NDP needs to know that we have eliminated over 80 long-term boil water advisories through our work over the past years, and we are on track to eliminating all of them on time by next spring. They do not have access to clean drinking water, and communities are going off the list only to return back on to the list of boil water advisories. It would be great if the members opposite talked about some good news instead of just highlighting the very real problems that are there. Chair, we continue to manage our fiscal situation in a responsible manner, and we'll continue to do that. pierre poilievre: How much does the Government of Canada owe to the People's Republic of China? hon. If the member would like to send my office questions directly, I'd be happy to provide this information. They still haven't provided answers to the questions, in particular the question regarding who owns Canada's foreign-held debt. How much of that debt is owned by lenders from the People's Republic of China? hon. We'll get to it in order, as we work through this crisis, making sure we focus on Canadians first. Chair, we'd be happy to provide information in this regard should the member wish to send a request directly to my office. Chair, moving along to the impacts of the debt on our people, how much would a 1% increase in the effective interest rate on Canada's national debt cost Canadian taxpayers? hon. I'd be happy to get financial calculations to the member if he'd like to send those directly to my office. Chair, we'll try a different question, then, as we're not getting any answers. Chair, I'd be happy to get this information to the member, but I would acknowledge that as we manage the treasury function for the Government of Canada, we look at the short term, the medium term and the long term. We think we have come up with a responsible approach to managing the ongoing debt that we have as a country. Chair, it turns out, according to Department of Finance officials, that less than 3% of Canada's recently added debt since March is for terms of more than five years. Why has this minister made Canada so susceptible to future interest rate hikes by failing to lock in the $371.5 billion of new debt he's added in the last two and a half months? hon. Chair, we continue to manage the treasury function of the Government of Canada in a responsible way, making sure we consider what debt should be issued in a short term, a medium term and a long term, which we've been doing as the Government of Canada during our entire term and as previous governments have done as well. pierre poilievre: Canadians would be wise not to hire this minister as their mortgage broker if they're looking to get the best rate. How many Canadians would experience bankruptcy in the next 12 months if interest rates were to rise by an effective one percentage point? hon. I would make the observation that what we've been working to do during the course of this pandemic is to support Canadians and support Canadian families by providing them income during a time when they don't have access to income because they're actually at home. We think that has supported them in a very, very positive way that allows us to ensure that we will have a continuing economy when we get through this crisis. pierre poilievre: Unfortunately, we will have a $1-trillion debt when this fiscal year comes to an end. How much will the finance minister try to raise taxes if interest rates on that debt rise by, say, 1%? hon. I think the approach we've taken, with the emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy, has been particularly critical for enabling Canadians to get through a very challenging time. bruce stanton): The floor goes to the honourable member for Beauce, Mr.Lehoux. richard lehoux: Mr.Chair, my question goes to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. Day after day, I speak with those involved in the world of agriculture and with witnesses appearing before the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): Mr.Chair, we have made commitments to producers all across the country. We have also increased our contribution to various other programs, specifically in the meat sector, for pork or beef producers, and food processors. richard lehoux: Mr.Chair, I have been hearing the same answers for several weeks now. We are going to determine where the gaps are and we will identify the sectors that most need our assistance. richard lehoux: Mr.Chair, the government promised to set its share of the business risk management programs at 60%, even if a province or territory does not participate. Through the AgriRecovery program, we have provided $50million for pork producers and $50million for beef producers. richard lehoux: Mr.Chair, when will that transfer be made? Can the minister simply give us a date? That is all we are asking. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, I would really like to be able to give a date, but the answer depends on each of the provinces. richard lehoux: However, Mr.Chair, the minister has told us that she is ready to transfer the funds, whether or not the provinces add any to the program. How does the Minister of Agriculture intend to make major changes to the various risk management programs by July, when the government has itself pushed back the federal-provincial-territorial meeting of Ministers of Agriculture to October? We have been meeting by Zoom for some time now. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, I meet with my provincial colleagues every week, either by conference call or by Zoom. As for the AgriRecovery program, once again, the provinces have to implement it and it is their choice to contribute their share of 40% or not, in whole or in part. richard lehoux: Mr.Chair, if I understand correctly, there will be no changes to the various programs before November. The sectors of agriculture under supply management, like eggs and poultry producers in my constituency, who have been promised compensation for a long time, want to know when the money will be transferred to the producers who are working tirelessly to feed our country. Our commitment to them in terms of compensation in response to the three free-trade agreements is still firm. I am thinking, for example, about the advances that many SMEs and farmers in my constituency could implement in their companies. When will I be able to tell my constituents that reliable Internet service will be available in their homes? hon. marie-claude bibeau: I assure you that we recognize the importance of the Internet in rural regions. We are working with our colleagues, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry and the Minister of Rural Economic Development to speed up the implementation of programs along those lines. anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): We'll now proceed to Mr. Chair, for the Minister of Public Safety, Minister Blair, how many times has the list of banned firearms changed since May 1? hon. bill blair (minister of public safety and emergency preparedness): My understanding is that an order in council was made on May 1, and we have not made any changes to that order in council. bill blair: I suspect the member may be referring to the work that the RCMP has been doing through the Canadian firearms program in order to apply the order in council that was passed. glen motz: How many .22 calibre rifles, firearms, are on that banned list? hon. The member may be referring to a weapon that the RCMP has identified as using an AR-15 frame, which of course mr. bill blair: That's another bit of mistruth and deception put out by the gun lobby. In fact, there was a weapon called the Blackwater AR-15, which was a real gun that was prohibited, but the toy gun, the airsoft one, was not. Why is the RCMP continuing to add firearms to the prohibited list after the list was published? hon. Chair, it is a very important that the RCMP, as the agency responsible for administering the Canadian firearms program, continues to do its diligence to keep Canadians safe. glen motz: Why has there been no notice given to firearms owners, retailers or the police of the many changes to the banned firearms list? hon. Chair, it is very important that the Canadian firearms program and the RCMP continue to do the important work of ensuring that Canadians are kept safe. glen motz: How many firearms have been transferred between licensed gun owners and/or retailers since May 1? hon. bill blair: Again, I do not have that information and, as the member probably knows, records are not kept by the government or by law enforcement about the transfer of firearms that are not restricted. glen motz: How many firearms have been retroactively changed to prohibited since May 1? Of the firearms that have been transferred, how many now are retroactively prohibited since May 1? hon. Chair, to be very clear, on May 1, by order in council, we prohibited 1,500 somewhat different types of firearms, all based upon a military design. glen motz: Since that time you have added almost 700 more, and none of those meet that category you are trying to establish. If a firearm that was not on the original prohibited list was transferred since May 1 and now that firearm appears on that prohibited list, are those transfers subject to a criminal prosecution? hon. bill blair: Again, the member is asking me a question that is solely the responsibility of the law enforcement agency of jurisdiction, and that is their decision, not ours. glen motz: The minister has said that the issuance of firearm licences and transfers was stopped recently due to a printer failure. bill blair: I have absolutely no knowledge of the allegation the member has just made, Mr. glen motz: Maybe the minister needs to check with his officials and find out who actually did the ordering. What does the minister believe to be the estimated cost of the firearms confiscation plan? hon. We will, however, be bringing legislation forward at the very first opportunity to facilitate a buyback program that will treat Canadians who purchased these firearms fairly. glen motz: You can't buy back something that you never owned in the first place, Mr. If this minister doesn't know the cost, maybe he's as incompetent as our Minister of Finance. I am wondering, Chair, through you, why the law enforcement notes were removed from the firearms reference table? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members that parliamentary language is something we need to respect in the House. I'd just like to advise you and this House that our purpose is to protect the lives of Canadians, and we are taking strong action to strengthen gun control. We are not influenced by the gun lobby or by gun manufacturers, only by our interest in keeping Canadians safe. eric duncan (stormontdundassouth glengarry, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr. I want to start by thanking the government for listening to my proposals a couple of weeks ago regarding the extension of benefits for vulnerable Canadians who may not have been able to file their income tax by this week's deadline. There are millions of relieved seniors with GIS and parents with the child tax benefit and GST who now know they have a bit of time and protection and aren't to be cut off from their benefits. I'm hoping to go two for two here today, so there's no pressure to the Minister of Public Safety. I certainly support, and I think we support in this chamber, the idea of the extension for travel. However, it's now been three months since many spouses have seen each other, and there are Canadian and American children in custody arrangements who have seen their parent only on one side of the border or the other. After stating for months that reunifying families wasn't considered essential travel, I am thankful that he and the Prime Minister have now said that it is. Will the minister agree to the safe and fair proposal we outlined in our letter last week, which would exempt spouses, children and those with medical needs travelling back and forth with accompanying documentation, so that we can get people and their families back together? hon. bill blair: I'd like to thank the member for what I think is a very important question and I want to assure him that I have had similar conversations with members of this House from all parties and representing all parts of the country. Because there is a great deal of concern in our communities and from our provincial and territorial partners about the movement of people across our border, any change has to be discussed and negotiated with our provincial partners. Some of them, you may be aware, have expressed some concern, and we're addressing those concerns because we respect their concerns. At the same time we are working very hard, and I am very hopeful that we'll be able to resolve this challenge to the satisfaction of the many Canadians you and everyone else represents. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members that when they are asking or answering a question, they should speak through the Chair and not directly to the other member. I will just note that the Canadian and American governments have worked with provinces, as we have with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to repatriate Canadians from around the world. I believe there is a precedent and I believe there is a background there, and I think we can, through an order in council or whatever measure, get people back with their families. Can the minister explain why reunifying families needs to be any different from repatriating Canadians from other countries? hon. bill blair: Again I thank the member, because this is a very important issue and it's important to us as well. We have been working over the past couple of weeks very diligently on trying to find a resolution of this problem, because it is never our intention to separate families and we have all heard some very heart-wrenching concerns that have been raised. At the same time, I think it's important to work very closely, as we have done, with our provincial and territorial partners to ensure that we address the concerns they have raised. We are prepared to move forward and we are working very hard to resolve the concerns that were raised so that we can have a positive answer to those many families, and we the chair: We will go back to Mr. They spend about five months of the year in Texas and five months in Cornwall and would generally travel about two months of the year. However, she couldn't come up to Canada because of the restrictions that have been put in place, and it's certainly putting a strain on them. Can the minister confirm that the three concerns we outlined in our letter are being discussed as part of reaching a solution or a resolution as soon as possible? The three concerns are that spouses and long-term partners can be reunited, that children with child custody arrangements can see both of their parents, and that if somebody needs to travel back or forth over the border for medical appointments, they can do that and can stay with their spouse. bill blair: What I can confirm is that we're working hard to make sure we keep families together. I want to reiterate, because you raise a very important point, that when people cross the border they're still subject to the quarantine orders of public health. If the travel is deemed essential, that is an exception, but if it is not deemed essential, then a person must go into quarantine for 14 days. That's one of the concerns the provinces have raised with us and one of the assurances they have sought. the chair: Before we go to the next line of questioning, I want to remind the honourable members that we have interpreters who are working very hard to translate from one language to the other. I therefore ask you to speak a little more slowly out of consideration for the interpreters, who are doing a really good job. The loss of the Regina International Airport would be devastating, not only to the city of Regina but also to southern Saskatchewan. The Liberal government has made a great show out of allegedly providing $330 million in assistance to airports through lease deferrals, but here is what it's not telling people: Airport lease payments are already tied to revenue and have been for many years, so when an airport's revenue goes down to zero, its lease payments to the federal government go down to zero, pandemic or no pandemic. bill blair: The Minister of Transport has been working very closely with airports, large and small, right across the country. We've been in touch with each of the airports, and we've been working very hard to help them manage through these difficult times. We know that in some circumstances, continued operations at smaller airports have not been possible, but wherever possible we have done our very best to try to accommodate the very real financial challenges these airports are experiencing. Chair, Canada's airports are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and the Liberal government's response has been to defer their lease payments. government's CARES program is providing $10 billion in grants and low-interest forgivable loans to support American airports. Will the government commit today to saving Canada's airports with a similar program of grants and forgivable loans? hon. Chair, we have worked very hard, and continue to do so, to make sure we provide supports to regional airports right across this country. We know how important air transport is to such a vast country and we know the tremendous work they do. We're going to work very closely with them to make sure we provide the right supports to help them get through this difficult time, because we know how important they will be to the eventual restart of our economy. Airports are vital to Canada's economy, providing over 200,000 jobs nationwide and paying $13 billion in wages and $7 billion in taxes. However, now Canada's airports are on the brink of collapse, and the government has stood idly by as airports have lost over 90% of their revenue. Last month Joyce Carter, chair of the Canadian Airports Council, called on the government for a three-point plan for airport recovery. It includes the permanent elimination of ground leases, substantive loan and bond guarantees and a special plan to support smaller airports that provide vital supplies to rural and remote communities. Could the minister inform the committee if the government has done anything in response to the Canadian Airports Council's request? hon. bill blair: I would make the observation that all of our smaller regional airports are vital to the communities they serve. The Minister of Transport is in regular communication and in ongoing discussions with airport authorities, large and small, right across this country on how we can continue to support them. There have been a number of proposals made by the industry itself and by some of the regional airports on what form that help can take. I believe it is clear that Canadians need our help, and we are there for Canadians to help them get back on their feet when we get through this pandemic. Chair, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan have all started free trade negotiations with the United Kingdom. We, of course, are going to make sure that we will always act in the interests of Canadian businesses, and I want to assure Canadians that CETA continues to apply to our trade with the United Kingdom. I would like to know how many full-time and part-time employees are currently working for the Liberal Party of Canada. pablo rodriguez (leader of the government in the house of commons): On a point of order, Mr.Chair. I am not sure that the number of employees at the Liberal Party, the Bloc Qubcois, or the Conservative Party is relevant to government management. the chair: I am not sure whether that is a point of order, but I will let Mr.Therrien continue. I would like to know how many people work full time and part time for the Liberal Party of Canada. alain therrien: Mr.Chair, I know that they think its funny to pilfer taxpayers money from government coffers. bill morneau: I do not know how many people work for the Liberal Party, but I can say that the emergency wage subsidy is for all sectors of the economy. That is how we can protect employees across the country who are working for businesses facing a reduction in revenue of 30% or more. alain therrien: They have 157MPs and they have known for two weeks that we are working on the wage subsidy. In an article in La Presse on May25, Liberal Party spokesman Braeden Caley said that between 75and 100employees were receiving wages subsidized through this program. bill morneau: I am very focused on our concern, which is to protect Canadians across the country who are working for businesses facing a reduction in revenue of 30% or more. How many employees in the Liberal Party of Canada are threatened by the pandemic? You should know; it's your party. We want to make sure that they have enough money to meet the challenges that they are facing during the pandemic. alain therrien: I would actually say that they want to have enough money for their next election campaign. I would like to know how much taxpayers' money has been taken from the emergency wage subsidy program and will be used as election loot for the Liberal Party of Canada. bill morneau: The emergency wage subsidy program allows us to protect 75% of the income that employees were earning before the crisis, to a maximum of $847. alain therrien: Mr.Chair, since I am not getting an answer, let me share with you the very simple calculation I cobbled together. If we multiply that amount by threethat's three months, since it started on March15we get over $1million. That is the amount they will have put in their pockets, to be used as election loot for the Liberal Party. Given that the Liberals are extending the emergency wage subsidy, will their party continue to help itself to the money? hon. the chair: Mr.Therrien, you can ask a question of no more than 15seconds. alain therrien: They have already taken $1million out of the register, so that is settled. First, are they going to pay back that $1million? Second, I hope they will not be taking another $1million by September. bill morneau: We will continue with our approach to protect employees and businesses needing it during the crisis. During the previous Parliament, our government made significant investments in the CBSA and the RCMP, and provided funds to provinces and territories to invest in programs that combat gun and gang violence and support our communities in providing positive alternatives for youth engagement and activities. This is something that we pledged to do during the last federal election and something that victims' groups, law enforcement and everyday Canadians called on for decades, but we must know that we need to take more action to keep our communities safe. Can the minister tell the House and the constituents of NewmarketAurora what further steps our government will take to keep Canadians safe? hon. Chair, I'd like to begin by thanking the honourable member for NewmarketAurora for his question and for his advocacy on behalf of the safety of his community. Chair, building upon historic investments that we made in the last Parliament in law enforcement dealing with guns and gangs, we took the important next step in our promise to strengthen Canada's gun control by prohibiting weapons that many in the law enforcement community, including the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, have said have no place in our communities. We will build on these early steps by strengthening our work and our laws at the border, by taking steps to prevent the theft and criminal diversion of guns and also by making significant investments in kids, families and communities where the conditions give rise to gun violence right across Canada. Even during these challenging times, we have seen restaurants and other businesses step up to deliver meals to front-line workers and make donations to our local food banks. I have heard from many small business owners in Scarborough, from dentists to small manufacturers, who are having trouble paying their commercial rents due to the sharp downturn in business caused by COVID-19. They are interested in how programs like the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program would help them to stay in business, but they worry that these programs may not be able to help if their landlords don't participate. Could the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade please explain why it is so important that the landlords participate to help small businesses make it through the pandemic and how we are working to make this program a success, not just here in Scarborough but across Canada? hon. Chair, I want to thank the member of Parliament for her advocacy for the people of Scarborough Centre on this really important question. This is why we have stepped up to provide rent relief to businesses while, at the same time, helping property owners maintain the rental income through this crisis. We are asking property owners to do their part in keeping small businesses and their employees to get through these challenging times, and to take advantage of our forgivable loans in order to help small businesses that are the hardest hit by reducing their rent by 75%. We will continue to do what we can to help protect and help our small businesses across Canada from coast to coast to coast. jenny kwan (vancouver east, ndp): The $4-billion Canada housing benefit agreement was announced in 2017. It's supposed to provide up to $2,500 per year to help families in need with their rent. We know that poverty and inadequate housing are barriers felt even more by black, indigenous and racialized people. We introduced the Canada housing benefit as part of the national housing strategy to help people as a bridge to permanent housing, people who are in core housing need, are homeless or at risk of homelessness. We hope all of them come to the table to sign this really important cost-sharing the chair: We will go back to Ms. Only one province has signed on, and there has been no national consultation on how such a benefit program would even be implemented. With so little federal leadership, the Canadian Alliance of Non-Profit Housing Associations has stepped up and done the work for the government. Will the minister adopt those principles and get on with ensuring vulnerable families get the rental assistance they need? hon. Chair, it is really unfortunate that the honourable member thinks that an investment of $55 billion and the commitment of a 10-year federal plan of leadership in affordable housing and community housing is a lack of leadership. The Canada housing benefit is yet another important segment of the national housing strategy, which will ensure people have access to a safe, affordable place to call home. The fact is that two and a half million families are paying more than 30% of their income on rent, and they have been hit hard by this pandemic. Aside from going forward with a housing benefit program, will the government prioritize affordable housing stimulus spending as a key component of any post-COVID stimulus policy? hon. Chair, joining with provinces and territories and providing real help to members of the community who are experiencing homelessness so they can have a permanent roof over their heads is real action. This is a real benefit that is going to households in core housing need, people who experience a core housing need and who need a permanent place to call home. We bought our first hotel to house the homeless in permanent housing, and the government has yet to provide any funding to them. marco mendicino (minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship): I thank my colleague for the question, and I want to extend our sympathies regarding the temporary worker who passed away from COVID-19. Of course, we continue to support workers by ensuring that they have the accommodations and the spacing necessary to work when they are here providing food security for all Canadians. We put in place the regulations and the rules that are necessary, and we continue to work very closely with our provincial partners as well as leaders in this sector so that we can protect workers and ensure that Canadians have access to safe and affordable food. jenny kwan: No one should have to endure such inhumane housing conditions and risk their lives to support their families. They don't have access to health care and they don't have a pathway to permanent residence. Will the minister do the right thing and grant migrant workers health care coverage and ensure the government follows up on the principle that if you're good enough to work, you're good enough to stay? hon. Of course, that is an opportunity we will continue to offer those who are ensuring that Canadians have access to healthy, safe and affordable food. We will continue to make the investments that are necessary to maintain a high standard of professionalism and workplace safety. Chair, fisheries and oceans stakeholders and coastal communities face unprecedented threats from the COVID-19 crisis, and they deserve the support of all levels of government, including their own MPs. Yesterday the Liberal and NDP MPs banded together to restrict the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans to just four hours of sitting in the summer months. Conservatives are ready to put in the hours to support Canadians, while the Liberals and NDP refuse to do the work. When will the Prime Minister tell his MPs to get back to work for the Canadians who need their support? hon. Chair, we all agree that committees are doing extremely important work, and that's why committees are meeting regularly. I would like to remind my colleague that the committees are masters of their own destiny and make their own decisions, not the government. Chair, it took months for DFO to realize that fish passage on the Fraser River was blocked at Big Bar. Now that contract has tripled from $17.6 million to over $52.5 million without a single communications post from the minister's office. Chair, since we found out about the landslide at Big Bar, our government has been extremely active in making sure that the salmon have a passage through. We know how critically important the salmon are to the Fraser River, as well as to the indigenous communities along the Fraser. So far, we've made significant progress, but we know there's more work that needs to be done. That's why we'll continue to work with indigenous communities and the province to make sure that these mr. Chair, the fisheries minister's mandate letter from November of last year directed her to make new investments in fighting invasive species. Canadians on the front line of prevention wrote the minister, and when they got a response five months later, it was devoid of any help. When will the minister follow her Prime Minister's directive and make new investments in the fight against invasive species? hon. We're working diligently to find the answers to deal with some of the problems we are seeing from invasive species. I am committed to making sure that I meet my commitments within my mandate letter, and I will have more to say on that soon. Chair, the list of hunting and sport shooting firearms banned by Minister Blair's order in council continues to grow. Chair, to be very clear, the weapons we have prohibited are weapons that were not designed for hunting or sport shooting but for soldiers to use in combat. As law enforcement leaders right across the country have said many times, they have no place in our community, and we agree. Chair, I continue to hear from constituents in the North OkanaganShuswap who are unable to access supports under the Canada emergency business account or the emergency commercial rent assistance program. Business owners have also lost employees and can't get them to come back to work because of the lack of flexibility in the emergency response benefit and the emergency student benefit. Chair, we continue to look at the programs we've put out to support Canadians to make sure that they are actually having the desired impact. We've committed to extending the wage subsidy, and of course we're looking at all the measures we've put out so we can ensure that people have the support they need during this crisis. Chair, an April 1 letter confirms that Deloitte Canada has been contracted to help supply PPE. Chair, the honourable member is correct that we have contracted with Deloitte to assist us with our operations on the ground in China in order to have an A-to-Z procurement approach to delivering goods the chair: We will go back to Mr. arnold viersen: Can the minister confirm that this was, indeed, a sole-source contract? hon. Chair, there are a number of goods that need to be procured for Canadian health care professionals to be safe, and that's exactly the chair: We'll go to Mr. Chair, I will take that question back to my department and come back to the member with a further, fuller response. The contracts that we are entering into are made by us the chair: We will go back to Mr. arnold viersen: Many of the suppliers that are in contact with Deloitte of Canada are indigenous contractors. Chair, we are in touch with indigenous suppliers, as we are with many suppliers across Canada and internationally. We are working hard to make sure that we have diverse supply chains across the board, and that means including indigenous suppliers in that mix. arnold viersen: Many of these indigenous suppliers have previously been vetted by the federal government and are certified vendors. Chair, the honourable member appears to have information regarding Deloitte's certification processes, which would not be outside what the government itself is doing. I encourage him to come forward with a question that actually responds to fact before the chair: Go ahead, Mr. arnold viersen: Does the minister think that re-vetting suppliers is a good use of resources? hon. I believe that Canada is in a crisis, and I am making every effort to order PPE as Canadian health care workers require. Chair, we are in touch with indigenous suppliers and will continue to ensure that Canada has a diverse supply chain in terms of manufacturers, in terms of products and in terms of countries. Chair, I would like to say that we are continuing to make sure that our supplier list is confidential, because we are in a crisis and we do not want to jeopardize  The Chair: We go back to Mr. Chair, on Friday the association for indigenous business could not name a single indigenous company that had been contracted. Have any of the contracts signed with the federal government between Deloitte Canada and PPE suppliers been filled? hon. Deloitte is assisting with and sourcing manufacturers, and all contracts are signed by the government with manufacturers. pierre paul-hus (charlesbourghaute-saint-charles, cpc): Mr.Chair, we have difficulty understanding the government's management of the border. The order between Canada and the United States has an exception allowing refugee claimants to submit their claims in Canada if they have family here and we accept them. I find it hard to believe that the minister cannot quickly instruct border services officers to allow spouses to enter the country right now. Chair, I appreciate very much the member's intervention and the long list of people he sent to me. Chair, we're working diligently with our provincial and territorial partners to take the steps necessary to enable people to stay united as they cross the borders and enter into Canada, but to do so safely and not put other Canadians at risk. pierre paul-hus: Mr.Chair, letting a spouse come home will not put Canadians at risk. A survey conducted in Canada reveals that a large majority of Canadians do not trust the Chinese communist regime at all and do not want Huawei in Canada. Now that the government no longer has to worry about BCE and Telus, can they say today that no other company is going to use Huawei and that Huawei will be banned from Canada for 5G? hon. pierre paul-hus: Let me remind the minister that we have been working on this for years and that CSIS has confirmed that Huawei is unreliable as far as Canada's security is concerned. The same regime continues to lie to the world about COVID-19, block our exports, and terrorize the citizens of Hong Kong. When will the Prime Minister confirm that he is going to ban Huawei from developing 5G in Canada? It is a simple question. At the same time, the safety and security of Canada's digital environment will be of paramount consideration. We're doing the work required and we're not basing that agenda on some media report, but instead ensuring that all scientific and security factors are taken into account. We are engaged in robust discussions with our Five Eyes partners, including the United States, and all our security agencies. Chair, we'll do the work necessary to the chair: Mr.Paul-Hus has the floor. pierre paul-hus: The minister does not need a sheet of paper, this matter has been clear for a long time. Bell and Telus had each estimated that removing Huawei from their development would cost $1billion. Did the government decide to pay for this under wraps to get out of it? Having said that, my next question is more about the theft on May27. About 90,000surgical masks bound for the Quebec City UHC were stolen from the Toronto airport. Has the minister called for an investigation? When are we going to find out what happened to those stolen masks that were bound for Quebec? hon. Our procurements have reached 101 million surgical masks at this time, and they're being distributed to provinces, including Quebec. the chair: Mr.Paul-Hus, you have time to ask a 15-second question. The police officer is asking me what to do with the cheques and to whom they should be sent. We understand that in delivering this benefit to a million Canadians to date, we had to put more of our integrity measures at the back, but make no mistake: Canadians who behave fraudulently will be held to account, and we will ensure that the money is either repaid or the cheques not cashed. Chair, there remains a concern across Canada that delays in the criminal courts could result in criminals walking free. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court recently said in an interview that amendments to the Criminal Code could allow this backlog to be addressed. Can the minister outline what work has been done to address the backlog, and when we can expect to see it addressed? hon. I can assure him that we are working closely with our provincial and territorial counterparts, who have the primary responsible for the superior courts of justice and therefore the criminal law in their various jurisdictions for the administration of justice in criminal law. I can also say that we have formed an action committee co-chaired by me and the Chief Justice of Canada, again with a variety of different kinds of representation on that committee, to look at the restart of the justice system the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, weeks ago I raised these concerns with the minister over backlogs in the criminal courts and the risk they present to our justice system. The provinces have significant insight into how this can be addressed, and many provinces have been proactive with their court backlogs. We're working to serve in a coordinating role as a repository of information for best practices so that they can be shared across provinces. rob moore: Many owners of small businesses in my riding, and indeed in all of our ridings, are suffering right now and have received absolutely no help from this government because of technicalities. Two weeks ago, the Prime Minister indicated the government was looking to expand access to the Canada emergency business account to include to those who operate their businesses out of a personal bank account. This is something that we've been calling for over the past several weeks, and businesses cannot wait any longer. Can the minister tell me what we should be telling our constituents about those who are caught up based on a technicality and are not able to access this important measure? hon. I want to assure the small business owners in his community and all across the country just how important they are and how difficult a time this is for them. We are hearing you and we are working as hard and as fast as we can to make sure that those business owners get access to this very important support. I would like to highlight, though, that owners of 650,000 small businesses across the country are getting the loan support. rob moore: The lack of access to high-speed Internet remains a major issue across my home province of New Brunswick. The lack of progress and transparency on rural Internet is frustrating for residents, for municipal leaders and for small business owners who are already suffering due to COVID. When will a new plan for rural Internet be introduced, and how quickly can we expect it to be deployed? hon. To date, we've set aside investments to connect a million households, and there's more work to be done. We will be announcing our next steps to connect more Canadians through the universal broadband funds in the days to come. I look forward to communities across the country benefiting from federal investments and the private investments that our investments will bring. rob moore: On the issue of commercial rent, how is the government going to ensure that business owners whose landlords still refuse to participate in the government's program receive the support that they need to stay open at this time? hon. Chair, as the member knows and would understand, rent between small business owners and landlords is a provincial jurisdiction. That said, we've moved forward to try to ensure that there's a process so that those landlords and the commercial tenants can work together to come up with a solution that will work for both. George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Nicholas Gibbs, Colten Boushie, Tina Fontaine, Alain Magloire and Breonna Taylor were not all born on the same side of the border, but they all lost their lives at the hand of the same cruel enemy: racism. We cannot, here in Canada, think higher of ourselves when we are reading the headlines of our neighbour. The final report from the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls stated that indigenous women and girls have faced a Canadian genocide. In 2018 a report revealed that a black person was almost 20 times more likely than a white person to be fatally shot by the Toronto police, and a 2019 report exposed systemic bias among the Montreal police force against black and indigenous people. I am asking the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, as per her mandate, what exactly our government intends to do now to fight racism among its institutions. If the anti-racism secretariat has in fact been established, what priorities have been actioned? hon. bardish chagger (minister of diversity and inclusion and youth): I would like to thank the member for that very important question. I will state that it is essential that we all work together, not only during this challenging time but during the times that come out of it. This is a resource not only for Canadians but also for government agencies to better the way in which we do work internally as well, including advancement opportunities. That's exactly why we came out with an open, transparent, merit-based appointment process: so that we can see the country's diversity reflected at the decision-making table. I can assure the member and all Canadians that my eyes are open, my ears are open and I am an ally. I cannot experience what it is to be a black Canadian, but I can tell you that your voices will be represented and they will be heard. Why is it that the 12,500 class members who have been determined eligible still haven't received the payments they are owed? These people deserve justice without any delay, especially in light of COVID-19 and the added pressures facing communities. As you know, because of the exceptional circumstance of COVID-19, the class counsel, with the support of Canada, was seeking direction from the courts to issue partial payments to the class members with a valid claim. Once granted, eligible class members can expect to receive partial payments of $21,000 over the coming weeks. Eighty per cent of people who are diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, will die within two to five years of receiving the diagnosis. The pandemic has made it more difficult than ever for these people to access medical appointments and treatment. The lack of urgency to approve new trials and therapies in Canada directly impacts the life expectancy of people with ALS. Can the Minister of Health commit to taking leadership on this file, removing the barriers to accessing these promising treatments and therapies, and ensuring that the costs of these treatments will be covered? hon. Of course the member opposite has my commitment to work with the community and with manufacturers of drugs that are promising for ALS to expedite approval in a safe way that protects the health of Canadians but also provides treatment in an affordable way for all Canadians. Chair, I can't breathe and I'm tired, and today we've heard a lot of progressive words from the Prime Minister, but he hasn't really said anything. If the Prime Minister will not provide leadership in this House, will anybody from his cabinet here today commit to taking concrete steps to address anti-black racism? hon. The open, transparent, merit-based appointment process is resulting in the decision-making table better reflecting Canadians. Chair, will the member then commit today to make it a legal requirement to collect race-based data across all the ministries? hon. Chair, the recently announced immunity task force is providing disaggregated data to decision-makers, because decisions need to be based on science and evidence. It is also not lost on the black community that the former Toronto chief of police, the architect of this country's largest profiling program under the guise of street checks or carding, was made this country's Minister of Public Safety by this Prime Minister. As the tragic consequence of the unlawful, unconstitutional and racist practices in Toronto, black people are 20 times more likely than non-black people to be murdered by police. Does the Minister of Public Safety now admit that the police practice of street checks and carding is in fact a significant factor in Canada's systemic anti-black and anti-indigenous racism, and will he act to immediately end it today? hon. I know from experience that there is nothing more corrosive to the relationship of trust that must exist between the police and racialized communities than the issue of racism or the biased influences of those decisions. Chair, racial profiling is not only abhorrent and unacceptable, it's in fact unlawful. It's contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and it's contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act. We are working diligently within all of the federal agencies under my purview to ensure that all officers receive training on culturally competent and bias-free delivery of service. matthew green: Nobody knows better through experience about the corrosive practice of street checks than I do. Will the minister now apologize to the black community for the harm caused under his tenure as chief of police? hon. matthew green: Bill C-51 was introduced by the Conservatives and supported by the Liberals, including this Prime Minister. Each province was mandated to enact anti-terrorism protocols, which became a direction for the local police to engage in the practice of street checks or racial profiling. Given what he has said today in the House, will this Minister of Public Safety work to repeal the changes made under Bill C-51? hon. Chair, I will repeat for the member opposite that racial profiling and bias in the delivery of policing service is not only unacceptable and abhorrent but unlawful. It's contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; it is contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act. It cannot ever be tolerated in policing in any place in Canada, but we learned from the lived experience of black and indigenous communities, who tell us that this is still their lived experience, so there is a great deal of work left to do. martin champoux (drummond, bq): Mr.Chair, I will be sharing my time with the honourable member for Joliette. Supplementary unemployment benefits, or SUBs, give employers the opportunity to enhance their employees' employment insurance benefits when they need to temporarily lay them off. A number of companies, including Soprema in Drummond, have done so with the guarantee that the government would maintain the SUB terms when employment insurance is converted to the CERB. However, surprise, surprise, when the employees applied for the CERB in May, they found that they did not meet the criteria because the amount of SUBs they have received exceeded $1,000, the CERB income limit. In addition, they must reimburse the CERB because they found that they were not eligible for it. So, what does the Minister of Finance intend to do to correct his error? the chair: We will pause for a second. I had 10 seconds left by my count on my time before I was cut off, and I would appreciate, given the seriousness of the conversation here today, if the honourable Minister of Public Safety will please answer the question: Will he apologize to the black community for the irreparable harm that was caused by the racist process of street checks and carding? the chair: The way I work it is that if there are 15 seconds or less, we go on to the next one, because it's not really enough time to ask a question and get an answer. Chair, SUB plans that existed prior to March 15 are very much alive and in place for companies, employers and their employees. The CERB allows employers to top up an employee's wages to the maximum of a $1,000. Chair, in order to deliver this important critical benefit to Canadians, we had to go outside of the EI system. Employers can contribute as much as they want, and they were assured that this would be the case with the CERB. Let me put my question to the Minister of Finance again, in the hope that he will be the one to answer it. As we can all appreciate, delivering a benefit of this magnitude as quickly as possible to as many Canadians as possible, both those who were EI eligible and those who were outside of EI, resulted in our having to take some decisions to streamline processes and the system. gabriel ste-marie (joliette, bq): Mr.Chair, I will continue on the subject of supplementary unemployment benefits. The victims are thousands and thousands of workers who have to reimburse the Canada emergency response benefit, as my colleague just explained. I also have the question my colleague from Drummond asked: why is the government not doing the same thing it does with employment insurance and not counting the benefits paid out as part of earned income? It is simple. Chair, as legislated, we needed to set up a straightforward, simple benefit to deliver to as many people as possible. gabriel ste-marie: Mr.Chair, the truth is that the government has forgotten the thousands of workers covered under a supplementary unemployment benefit agreement. Chair, let me clarify that employees who were covered by a SUB plan prior to March 15 are indeed covered by that plan. We're working with employers to make sure that their workers have this benefit, regardless of whether or not the CERB is in place. Those who accessed EI after March 15 have been streamlined into the CERB process, and their employers can help them with up to $1,000 a month. However, the government says that, after the fact, it changed the rules that had previously applied, and it is no longer honouring its agreement. As I understand it, the government does not want to straighten out the situation, and that is unacceptable. Chair, I want to reassure the honourable member that we have moved quickly to deal with the unprecedented volumes at Service Canada. We have set up a 1,500-agent call centre to help people through the CERB, as well as redeploying 3,000 additional staff to make sure that people are helped through the EI process. As of December 31, 2019, the total number of pending veterans' disability benefits applications had already grown to over 46,000. Chair, I thank my honourable colleague for the question and for giving me the opportunity to respond to the Parliament of Canada from my home in Midgell. As I indicated earlier in the House of Commons, I can assure the member that one of my major priorities is to make sure that we deal with the backlog and that the veterans of Canada receive the benefits they truly deserve and need. brad redekopp: Those 46,000 applications from December of 2019 represent over 30,000 individual veterans. As you understand, with this pandemic there are some difficulties, but we are processing the same number of decisions daily. brad redekopp: On March 10, we learned that the average time that a veteran was waiting to have their disability benefit application processed had grown to 32 weeks. Chair, as I indicated, what we're doing is working to make sure that we streamline the process, make sure that some of the applications can be done automatically. Some cannot, because we have to make sure that what's provided to the veteran is adequate for the disability they the chair: We will go back to Mr. On March 10, the deputy minister of Veterans Affairs committed to providing the veterans affairs committee with an updated, written plan on how the department will resolve this backlog. Chair, I can assure my honourable colleague that of course the veterans affairs committee does vitally important work. My department is now working to make sure that the report itself reflects the reality we now face with the situation in the country. Chair, I'm sure that the department had a draft plan prior to COVID-19, so I wonder if Mr. Chair, I can assure my honourable colleague that we are working diligently to make sure that this report is prepared, and prepared properly, for the committee. As I said before, I fully understand the importance of the committee and the great work it does the chair: We'll go back to Mr. brad redekopp: Can the minister give us a timeline of when this report will be given to the committee? hon. I want to make sure that the report itself reflects the reality of the situation to make sure that the committee the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, of course this all ties in to the report that the veterans affairs committee is waiting for and to make sure that we're in place in order to make sure that the automatic approval can work and to make sure that veterans receive the proper the chair: We'll go back to Mr. brad redekopp: If automatic approval is implemented, does the minister know how many applications this measure will remove from the backlog? hon. Chair, it will remove a number from the backlog, because quite simply, if you're skydiving out of a plane, you're going to have knee problems, and if you're a gunner, you're going to have ear problems. To make sure that the veteran receives the appropriate remuneration the chair: Unfortunately, that's all the time we have for today<doc-sep>anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 20thmeeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a reminder to all members, in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not be connected to the video conference. I want to remind those who are participating by video conference that, when they talk, they must use the channel that corresponds to the language they are speaking in. Chair, today I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 2019 annual report on the RCMPs use of the law enforcement justification provisions. This report addresses the RCMP's use of specified provisions within the law enforcement justification regime, which is set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the Criminal Code. Chair, pursuant to Standing Order 32, I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 2018-19 progress report on Canada's national action plan for the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of a special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Members who are participating in the meeting in person are kindly asked to bring the signed certificate to the office once the petition has been presented. The petitioners note that research from around the world points to a threat to pollinators, particularly from a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids. The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to practise a precautionary principle and remove from use neonicotinoids in Canada to protect our pollinators. These iconic whales are much beloved in SaanichGulf Islands, throughout coastal British Columbia and indeed across Canada. The petitioners are calling for more action to be taken as the population of southern resident killer whales continues to decline, more action for boat-free safety zones, more prohibitions around whale tourism to make sure that the whales are safe from those who are keen to watch them from too close a distance, and more of a credible enforcement regime to support these measures to keep the southern resident killer whale population in our waters and not on the list of species that have become extinct. Chair, for over 10 years, members of Parliament from various parties have been trying to pass legislation to deal with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. Irwin Cotler, Borys Wrzesnewskyj, Senator Salma Ataullahjan and I have all proposed bills on this. This is another bill that would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. I'm sure petitioners would want me to add that, given the urgency of this issue, perhaps the government could consider bringing forward a government bill on this issue, which would allow the process to move much faster. Chair, I rise here today to present a petition from Canadian citizens in support of motion M-1, which was placed in this House by my colleague the member for New WestminsterBurnaby on the green new deal. These citizens point out that climate change has escalated into a global climate emergency and that Canada must act with ambition and urgency. They call on the government to support M-1, a made in Canada green new deal, to take bold and rapid action to adopt socially equitable climate action to tackle the climate emergency and address worsening socio-economic and racial inequalities at the same time while ending fossil fuel subsidies, closing offshore tax havens, and supporting workers impacted by the transition by creating well-paying, unionized jobs in the shift to a clean and renewable energy economy. Chair, it's an honour and privilege to table e-petition 2577, which was sponsored by Chris Alemany from Port Alberni and is supported by 5,183 petitioners. They're calling on the Government of Canada to work urgently across party lines and in partnership with provincial and territorial governments to implement a guaranteed, consistent, national and livable universal basic income system for all Canadians. The petition is very timely, coming almost one year to the day since the completion of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which also called on the government to establish a guaranteed annual livable income for all Canadians. Whether it's about providing a safety net to get through a global pandemic, the means to keep your children out of poverty at any time, or simply being able to afford safe housing or transportation, it's time for Canada to have this conversation. Chair, it's an honour and a privilege to present a petition on behalf of the constituents of NanaimoLadysmith. People are concerned about gas fracking and the use of methane and the destruction that methane causes to our atmosphere and with climate change. They're calling on the government to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on the Wet'suwet'en territory, and by ordering the RCMP to dismantle their exclusion zone and to stand down. They also call on the government to schedule nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentswhich is something that we're happy to see has been happening and I commend the government for that effortand to prioritize the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Chair, like Canada, Guyana is part of the Commonwealth, and many constituents of Winnipeg North have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in March, when it was being called into question. There have been some very positive indications in recent days, but the petitioners are asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to be aware of what's taking place in Guyana, and as much as possible, to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we're being diligent in supporting what the people of Guyana want to see. the chair: I just want to remind the honourable members, when presenting petitions, to be as concise as possible. I notice they're starting to stretch a bit and it's something we all tend to do. Chair, I just want to say thank you to the industrious people of Sudbury who have risen to the challenge and joined forces in the face of COVID-19. I am proud of all my constituents, and all Canadians, including first responders, volunteers, health care and essential workers, local miners, the farmers and produce growers who are feeding our families, and local businesses who are staying connected with their staff. I also salute all our homegrown innovations such as ProStitch and King Sportswear face masks; Crosscut Distillery hand sanitizer; Nobel Prize winner SNOLAB's work on ventilators, which earned a federal contract; Vale Canada's $1 million in seed capital to small firms developing COVID-19 health solutions; and many more. It's tucked in between the Fraser and Pitt rivers and is in the shadow of Golden Ears mountain. In the 1900s Dutch immigrants drained and diked the marshes allowing for today's bumper crops of cranberries and blueberries. It's hard to believe that this community is only a short commute to Vancouver and has one of the nation's busiest general aviation airports. In a great show of community spirit, from their front yards and balconies, thousands of residents came out to cheer for first responders and essential workers as we paraded throughout the city. I am thankful to have raised my family here, taught in the schools and to now be the member of Parliament representing this wonderful community. Chair, over the last few months I have watched constituents in my riding come together to look out for one another during these challenging times. Regardless of how deep and painful this pandemic has been, it continues to amaze me just how brightly the collective character of Cape BretonCanso shines through. Whether it is someone like Glen Muise, who delivers iPads to seniors' homes so they can connect with loved ones, teachers who deliver meals to students in need, Liam and Lucus Sakalauskas, two young boys who keep youth informed across the east coast, or Rose Fitzgerald, who delivered bouquets made from the remaining flowers from her shop to essential workers across her county, constituents in Cape BretonCanso have stepped up to support their community and to support those in need. Chair, as you know it is with great pride that I represent my constituents in Cape BretonCanso. They know that as a community, we're only as strong as our most vulnerable people, and I cannot help but be filled with joy when I see these gestures happening across my riding. sylvie brub (abitibibaie-jamesnunavikeeyou, bq): Mr.Chair, unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member Romeo Saganash, whose commitment I commend, to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the Viens commission in Quebec. The Bloc is open to the idea, but we shouldn't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action. Last year alone, the Viens report and the report stemming from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls contained dozens of recommendations. The federal government must work with indigenous peoples, Quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces. Hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation. steven mackinnon (gatineau, lib.): Mr.Chair, on behalf of myself and my parliamentary colleagues, I want to congratulate students from our high school class of 2020. We know that, owing to the pandemic, graduation celebrations will be different this year, as students will be deprived of their prom, their graduation ceremony and, in some cases, their goodbyes to friends and teachers. I know how disappointed students from the high schools of duVersant, LeCarrefour, Nicolas-Gatineau, de l'rablire, Collge Saint-Alexandre, Collge Nouvelles Frontires, Collge Saint-Joseph, Philemon-Wright and other regional schools, are not to be able to celebrate their five years of incredible efforts surrounded by their families and friends who were by their side on a daily basis. So when they receive their diploma, here is what I will say to them: Surge ahead! The future belongs to you. Be ambitious, follow your dreams and, most importantly, continue to change the Outaouais and the world! The class of 2020 will be remembered for a long time. Chair, I am delighted to rise to talk about the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre, which is now under construction in my riding in Winnipeg. This state-of-the-art addictions recovery facility was made into a reality by Scott, Anne and Darcy Oake in memory of their son and brother Bruce, who passed away tragically from an accidental overdose in 2011. The Bruce Oake Recovery Centre will provide help to thousands of Manitobans to manage their addiction and reintegrate into the community. With approximately eight million Canadians suffering from addictions, we need centres like these to help them recover so that no other family will face a heartbreaking loss due to addiction. Week after week residents and organizations have come together to support our most vulnerable during a time of great difficulty. I want to thank the champions of the community who were generous enough to donate masks and other supplies as well as services. I would also like to recognize the charities and care centres which, upon receiving these donations, redoubled their efforts to serve their communities. Special thanks go to the Mon Sheong Foundation Long-Term Care Centre, Divine Favour Senior Homecare, the Community & Home Assistance to Seniors, the True Compassion Home Health centre, Blue Door, the Mosaic Interfaith Out of the Cold program, Yellow Brick House, Hill House Hospice, Community Living York South, and Parya Trillium Foundation for continuing to support the residents in my riding of Richmond Hill. marie-france lalonde (orlans, lib.): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Usually, at this time of the year, I have the pleasure of being invited to the graduation ceremony of the grade12 students in Orlans. I cannot express enough how, in these exceptional times, I have witnessed the strength, resilience and community spirit of our graduates. I also know that a number of high schools have made significant efforts to celebrate the success of their graduating class. Young graduate Maryanne Collard was amazed to see that people from her school, the cole secondaire catholique Batrice-Desloges, had installed a sign in her garden to congratulate her on her academic success. The sad reality is that even before the crisis hit, most rural Canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable Internet connection, even though Internet is an essential service. Those in underserved areas, including many parts of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, cannot work from home and their children cannot keep up with their classmates. For many of my indigenous constituents, Internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies don't want to serve them. We call on the government to outline and implement a concrete action plan to address Internet connectivity deficits between rural and urban Canada. Congratulations go to Lutsl K' Dene First Nation and the Northwest Territory Mtis Nation, with support from Deninu K'ue First Nation and the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, for the establishment of the Thaidene Nn territorial protected area. It's 14,000 square kilometres of the most beautiful land and waters you'll find anywhere on earth. I would also like to thank the previous minister of the environment for securing Canada's $7.9-million commitment, along with our visit to celebrate the new park last year. The award is given to groups that have exemplified actions to protect critical ecosystems and biodiversity for generations to come and to show how indigenous peoples and local communities have confronted legacies of disadvantage and discrimination in support of their communities and the world at large. Chair, the Liberal government has tabled $87 billion in spending and allocated just four hours for Parliament to study, debate and pass it. They deserve to know that this government spending was scrutinized and passed through the rigours of Parliament. It is Canadian taxpayers of today and tomorrow who will have the responsibility to pay for this government's spending. It is real Canadians who fall through the cracks when this Liberal government's programs fail to meet their intended goals. Just as we gather four days a week for a hybrid committee meeting, parliamentarians can gather to do the full scope of the work that Canadians elected us to do. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I want to say to all the essential staff and the many support organizations that they are really changing things. Chair, today I rise to honour Justice 4 Black Lives Winnipeg, led by women and non-binary individuals, who stood together and mobilized our city to state clearly that we will not stand by and stay silent in the face of police brutality. We will not stand by while we witness our bodies being abused by centuries of racism supported through legislation that has left us vulnerable at the hands of those who abuse their power. We will join together to ensure that laws are instituted that are designed to protect us, not abuse us. To all the women and non-binary folks who are standing, I say, let's continue to sound our voices in solidarity and support of one another until indigenous and black lives are honoured and respected. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, this is not the time for governments to get complacent about COVID-19. First, he locked down Parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition, while the economic recovery must be prepared. We need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic. Chair, I rise to give thanks and recognition to the contributions of many businesses and organizations across my riding of Edmonton Mill Woods that have stepped up in a major way during this pandemic. I joined my friends in the Filipino community who partnered with Mill Woods' Calvary Community Church to deliver care packages to seniors. Varinder Bhullar and his Green Scholars of Alberta team and Dil-E-Punjab restaurant provided thousands of free meals. Edmonton Towing and its full team with Dukh Nivaran Gudwara prepared food packages for any truckers who were coming through Edmonton. The staff, nurses and doctors of Grey Nuns Community Hospital in the heart of Mill Woods have been keeping people safe and healthy. I want to thank our Mill Woods community as a whole for its continued strength, resilience and compassion as we move forward together. This year is a difficult one, though, for all of us, including our Portuguese diaspora community across the globe that is deeply affected by the COVID situation. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our luso community of over half a million members in Canada from coast to coast for staying strong during these difficult times. Your warmth, hard work and team spirit resonate well across my riding of Mississauga EastCooksville and globally. As a Portuguese immigrant who came to Canada at the age of two with my family, I know this year will be a lot different from previous years. I encourage all of you to stay safe and enjoy a Portuguese meal, and please continue to support our local businesses. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice in order to allow employees who provide support for sitting to substitute each other very safely. He is refusing to table a budget, refusing to provide an economic update and refusing to let the House of Commons do its work. Will he at least provide the Auditor General with the additional funding she needs to look into government expenditures? right hon. justin trudeau (prime minister): Mr.Chair, not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help Canadians with the Canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities, but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that. Under the government, the Auditor General has had to do more with less, and her ability to conduct audits is being affected. The Auditor General has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits, despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending. Will the Prime Minister give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job, yes or no? right hon. Chair, we worked with the Auditor General to increase the funding of the Auditor General's office in 2018-19, and the equivalent of 38 full-time staff were added. We support the Auditor General, unlike the Conservative government, which fired 60 people from the Auditor General's office. We are now proposing that we sit down to debate legislation this afternoon, and I certainly hope that members opposite will vote for debate. He well knows that it was the Auditor General's office that volunteered to make administrative efficiencies, which did not affect its ability to do the job. In fact, as the interim auditor general, John Wiersema, said, We would not have proposed if we didnt think it was the right thing to do and that wed be able to carry out our role for Parliament. Only the government's refusal to grant that extra funding is hampering the Auditor General's ability to give Canadians the answers they deserve, and we wonder why. This is the government that cannot explain where 20,000 infrastructure projects went and where five billion dollars' worth of supposed infrastructure investments have gone. Then there is, of course, the $35-billion Infrastructure Bank, which has completed precisely zero projects. Are these the reasons the Prime Minister is so intent on withholding funds from the Auditor General? right hon. Chair, talking of revisionist history, Stephen Harper's Conservatives cut $6.5 million from the Auditor General's budget and fired 60 staff. On the contrary, we worked with the Auditor General's office and increased its funding and added the equivalent of 38 new full-time staff. We will continue to respect the officers of Parliament, whom the Conservatives, in their time in office, showed no respect for. We will continue to move forward in a way that has led, for example, to proposing debate and voting on important legislation this afternoon to help Canadians. Chair, it's no surprise that the Prime Minister likes to reach back into history from before the 2015 election to justify his position. The 2015 election was the only time he got more votes than the Conservative Party did, so I understand why he likes to live in the past. In May, the interim auditor general said, Ten years ago, we were completing about 27 performance audits every year. The Auditor General's office has requested more funds to be able to do the job that Canadians expect to be done. Will the Prime Minister give those additional funds to the Auditor General's office, yes or no? right hon. Chair, we very much look forward to working with the new Auditor General to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions. Speaking of what is foundational to our institutions, this afternoon we're putting forward a bill that would help Canadians across the country, and we've proposed to debate and vote on that bill. They have been complaining about not having debates and votes in Parliament, and now they're proposing not to have them. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. This morning, we heard many groups and organizations that represent people with a disability express their concerns over the bill introduced by the government, which I feel is chocolate pudding containing cod liver oil. I am saying to the Prime Minister that, if he presents the part on disabled individuals, it will be passed at the speed of light. Is he prepared to divide the bill, so that we can work together to help people with a disability? right hon. We will also increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit from four-week intervals to two weeks. I am always willing to work with members of the opposition to ensure that we adopt these measures, all or some of the measures. That means that we are not adopting them all at the same time and that the bill is being split. Can the Prime Minister confirm that he is in fact going to split his bill so that we can address the various components separately, since they have nothing to do with each other, and improve them, in keeping with our mandate as elected officials? right hon. justin trudeau: Our goal on this side of the House, and it is shared by all members of the House, is to help Canadians during the pandemic. Yes, that includes Canadians living with disabilities, but it also includes businesses that cannot, but should be able to, access the wage subsidy. yves-franois blanchet: We almost had some clarity, but one swallow does not make a summer. The government says that it wants to transform the program into something very coercive, without admitting that the lack of an employment incentive has essentially sabotaged another program, the wage subsidy. When the government says that we are going to have to vote on this, it means rubber stamping its bill. justin trudeau: We are not proposing only to vote on this bill this afternoon, we are proposing to debate it. It is the role and responsibility of all of us in the House to exchange ideas and to work together to help Canadians. It is about helping people with disabilities, increasing the flexibility of the CERB, and expanding the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses have access to it. I would be remiss if I allowed the Prime Minister to mislead people quite unintentionallyI say this in accordance with the Standing Orders. When we introduce a bill, we discuss it at second reading, we vote, we continue to discuss it and we send it to committee. Can we follow the real procedures of Parliament, do a proper job, and then have a vote that is likely to suit the majority of members, not just the Prime Minister? right hon. We have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill, if they had amendments to propose. That is how we are taking action to help Canadians quickly during this crisis, and that is what we will continue to do. jagmeet singh (burnaby south, ndp): Mr.Chair, will the Prime Minister make a clear and direct commitment today to extend the CERB for families who need it? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help Canadians living with disabilities, will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit. jagmeet singh: Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB for families in need, yes or no? right hon. Chair, discussions are ongoing on that, but I can assure Canadians we will continue to be there for them and support them, as we have been. Chair, a family that needs to buy groceries can't take those pretty words and buy groceries with them. We are engaged with stakeholders, with opposition parties and with Canadians to ensure that we continue to support them the way they need to be supported. Don from Burnaby sent me a note saying he's an arts worker and there is no forecast for his job to be reopened. He sent an email saying he's faced with a grim realityhis wordsand he's frightened that if the CERB runs out, and it is planned to run out at the end of this month, then he will have no way to afford to make ends meet. Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB so Don does not have to live in fear? right hon. Chair, as I said, and as we have been saying from the beginning, we will continue to be there to support Canadians who need it. The member opposite is not actually looking at the fact that we are proposing three significant helps for Canadians this afternoon. We are proposing to help Canadians with disabilities, to expand the wage subsidy for more businesses and to create flexibility for the CERB. One of the things we asked the government to do five weeks ago was to bring in help for Canadians living with disabilities. Will the government commit to helping all Canadians living with disabilities and propose a plan that will do so? right hon. Chair, the NDP leader seems to have decided that rather than help 40%, or a significant portion, of people with disabilities, he wants to help none of them, because he's not going to allow the debate to move forward on this bill. Chair, I appreciate that the Prime Minister accepts that his plan only helps 40% of Canadians living with disabilities. Often it's the poorest of Canadians living with disabilities who won't be helped with the plan the government is proposing. Chair, our proposal will help 100% of Canadians who receive the disability tax credit, including many veterans. Why is the NDP not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation? the chair: Mr. We made it very clear that if the government extends the CERB, if it ensures there are no penalties on those who are desperately in need of help and if it helps all Canadians living with disabilities, we will move forward. Chair, as I have said from the beginning, we look forward to continuing to work with the members opposite to keep moving forward to help Canadians. I hope we're going to be able to actually have a debate and a vote on this important legislation this afternoon. the chair: We're now going to take a short pause to allow staff to change up in a safe way respecting COVID-19 procedure. alain rayes (richmondarthabaska, cpc): Mr.Chair, can the Prime Minister tell us whether we will have an economic update by the end of June? hon. bill morneau (minister of finance): Mr.Chair, I would like to thank the hon. When the situation is stable, we will have the chair: Once again, the floor goes to Mr.Rayes. alain rayes: Mr.Chair, most of the provinces in Canada are working on tabling economic updates by the end of June. bill morneau: I understand the importance of transparency and that is why we are trying every day to explain our investments to Canadians and to continue to be transparent with them. alain rayes: The Liberal government announced hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending during the pandemic, but it still refuses to provide an economic update in order to be transparent with Canadians. I repeat my question: why does this government not want to table an economic update by the end of June, when the provinces are doing so? hon. bill morneau: Every day, we explain the economic situation, our investments, the changes we are making, and our programs to improve the situation of Canadians during the pandemic. alain rayes: The Parliamentary Budget Officer himself does not understand why the federal government cannot deliver an economic update when the provinces can. Why are the government and the minister defying the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who is an independent officer and is requesting an economic update? hon. We think our approach of providing information daily is appropriate and we will continue to be transparent about our investments. When we listen to the minister and the Prime Minister talk, you would think we were in the pesky terrible twos phase that children go through, when they keep saying no, no, no. The provinces are doing it, the opposition parties are calling for it and the Parliamentary Budget Officer is calling for it. Why will the Minister of Finance not table an economic update so that all members of Parliament can do their verification work? hon. In the meantime, we will be adapting to the situation on a daily basis and making sure that we have the information we need to make our decisions and to make sure that Canadians understand our situation. alain rayes: Mr.Chair, one month ago, the Prime Minister announced with great fanfare that the eligibility criteria for the $40,000emergency loans for businesses would be more flexible to help self-employed entrepreneurs and businesses that pay themselves dividends to have access to them. However, as of todayit has been four weeks since that announcementbusinesses are still banging their heads on the doors of their financial institutions. In addition, even senior officials confirmed to me during a technical call on June2, last Tuesday, that this information would not be available for several weeks. Can the Minister of Finance, who says he wants to act quickly to help our businesses, explain why, after four weeks, it is still not possible to get the information the Prime Minister promised us from his doorstep? hon. mona fortier (minister of middle class prosperity and associate minister of finance): Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been listening and responding to small businesses and entrepreneurs across the country. In fact, we have even announced the expansion of the program's eligibility criteria to include many owner-managed small businesses with payrolls of less than$20,000. We are working around the clock to ensure that we are able to promptly provide small businesses across the country with the assistance they need. Can the government tell us what their plans are to help the travel, hospitality and tourism industry that so many of my constituents depend on? hon. I had a good conversation with the mayor of Niagara Falls recently, and we believe in the importance of the tourism sector. If he has clear, specific projects in the tourism sector that he needs help with, I would ask that he please come and see me and have a conversation. Chair, the message from the president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Perrin Beatty, and also other industries, is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what's going to happen through the strategy. What I've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence. We have been consulting with businesses on the appropriate way to extend the wage subsidy so that we can continue to support businesses as they turn towards a safe restart. We've also looked very carefully at how we can ensure that the programs that we've put forward the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Because of the shortage, in my riding of Niagara West, dentists have to pay up to 10 times the amount for an N95 mask. Compared to early March, when will the government finally begin to produce enough PPE in Canada to meet Canadian demand? hon. We have mobilized over 700 Canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in Canada as part of a made-in-Canada initiative. What's the evidence of this? We know that the government procured 10 million substandard N95 masks that couldn't be used. Planes are arriving empty that should have been filled with PPE, and we received less than 5% of our total order of gloves. When will this government finally begin to take PPE equipment issues seriously and make enough in Canada to meet demands by Canadians? hon. Regarding the flights that returned from China without federal cargo, Air Canada did reimburse the federal government for that amount. In addition, with regard to the N95 masks that were referenced, the Government of Canada will not pay for masks that it does not use. Furthermore, as my colleague Minister Bains just stated, we are mobilizing and retooling the domestic industry. dean allison: At a time when the Prime Minister has ordered Canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed, at a time when Canadians have had to say goodbye to their relatives over Skype, at a time when Canadians are not allowed to get married, at a time when Canadians are being fined for taking their kids to the park, at a time when restaurants are being fined $800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced, in these times, the Prime Minister's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing. Chair, why is it that there seems to be one set of rules in this country for some people but a different set for the Prime Minister? Why the double standard? hon. Chair, as the member knows, this country has been gripped with the need to stand up with one another to fight the experience of racism that so many Canadians live with and that so many of our American cousins live with. As the member knows, local public health sets advice for regions that he specified, and I would encourage all Canadians to check with local public health advice before they resume activities. It can take upwards of a year for Veterans Affairs to adjust their rate scale to compensate, and they do not allow for retroactive reimbursement. What are the government's actions to alleviate this hardship for our men and women who stood guard for this country, our veterans? hon. Chair, the fact is that when we inherited the government, Veterans Affairs needed a lot of support from government. In fact, at that time, we invested $10 billion to make sure that Veterans Affairs was put in place and that we could provide the appropriate supports for veterans, like the pension for life, the centre of excellence on PTSD and the chronic pain centre of excellence. Thank you, Minister, for answeringor respondingto my question, although that really did not provide an answer, in my humble opinion. The opposition has put forward clear proposals, such as a one-time tax-free withdrawal being allowed for an RRSP or a RRIF. To help preserve their registered retirement income fund assets, we are reducing minimum withdrawals by 25% for 2020. As the market is volatile during this time, we continue to look at all ways that we can best help seniors during this difficult time. It is anticipated that more unjust incarcerations will occur as Beijing imposes the national security law in Hong Kong. Has our government started preparing a list of names for Magnitsky-style sanctions, yes or no? hon. Chair, as we have said, we and our allies are deeply concerned with Beijing's decision to impose a national security law on Hong Kong. With hundreds of thousands of Canadians living in Hong Kong, we have a vested interest in its stability and prosperity, the foundations of which are Hong Kong's relative autonomy and basic freedoms. It's time for action, because the Chinese embassy has said, in response to Canada's expressed concern, that they deplore, reject and condemn our response and our concerns thus far. What are the conditions for this government using Magnitsky sanctions should China continue to incarcerate Canadians and jeopardize the human rights of its citizens? hon. We will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the Hong Kong population. Canada will always support and promote freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world. Chiu, we have about 22 seconds, so you have time for a very quick question and hopefully a very quick answer. When will this government listen to Canadians and call for a stronger, more effective and truly independent international investigation into COVID-19's origin? the chair: The honourable minister has 22 seconds or less, please. It is critically important that all countries in the world work together in a transparent, open and respectful manner so that we understand what is going on and how we can bring it to an end as quickly as possible. Chair, if the government orders someone who has been exposed to a confirmed COVID case into a 14-day quarantine, why won't the government allow them to take an antibody test to lift the quarantine so they can go back to work? hon. patty hajdu: As the member opposite may or may not know, testing strategies are determined by provinces and territories. Furthermore, the testing of a particular person has to be done at the right point in time the chair: We go back to Ms. My friend and colleague here, Colin Carrie, from the constituency of Oshawa, has a constituent who has a test. Why won't they provide a DIN number to it so that Canadians have access to it as well, regardless of which province or territory they live in? hon. Any test kit that would be approved by Health Canada would be accessible to wherever that company chose to market that test kit. Furthermore, it's really important that test kits that are approved by Health Canada be accurate and have been tested with rigour with regard to their ability to provide credible and accurate information to the people who are using that test. Chair, the test has proven to have an accuracy rate of 90% in identifying whether or not an individual has antibodies. Chair, I am happy to follow up with the member opposite's office when she is able to provide me with the name of the company. cheryl gallant: How long will it take for an antibody test to be approved by this government once you have the name of the company and the test and the evidence in front of you? the chair: Before we go to the honourable minister, I just want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair and not directly. patty hajdu: We have an expedited process that could be completed in as little as five to seven days, depending on the accuracy of the test and the information supplied by the vendor. Chair, will Health Canada use reputable data from other countries to speed their determinations about antibody effectiveness, or just continue to withhold access? hon. patty hajdu: Canadians expect us, at Health Canada, to ensure the accuracy and the safety of all equipment approved for use in Canada. Chairman, if the minister can approve tests and studies within five days, why is it taking over 30, over 60, or over 90 days to approve an antibody test that exists? hon. patty hajdu: I appreciate the member opposite's interest in urgent and quick approvals; however, sometimes, depending on the company, there may be further questions and further tests that need to be run to ensure the accuracy or safety of that equipment. Should she wish me to check into the process for a particular the chair: We will go back to Ms. cheryl gallant: Have officials provided the government with a target for a daily antibody test to complete an initial survey or the initial phase of a study? hon. Chair, I assume the member opposite is talking about the work of the immunity task force, which is, as you know, a group of scientists who have been funded by the Government of Canada the chair: We'll go back to Ms. Chair, would the minister please provide the names of the people on the task force to which she just referred? hon. cheryl gallant: I hope that will be within the next two days or so, and not wait until after the crisis has passed, Mr. Why isn't the Prime Minister showing as much fervour for antibody testing as he is for getting a vaccine on the market? hon. In fact, the Prime Minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage. pat kelly (calgary rocky ridge, cpc): When will the government give the Auditor General the funds she needs to do her job? hon. On behalf of the government, I would also like to offer her our full support and collaboration the chair: We'll go to Mr. pat kelly: I share the minister's wish to congratulate the new Auditor General on her position. Chair, our government has added 38 permanent staff positions to her office, while the Conservative government, under their leadership, cut the funding for more than 60 the chair: We'll move on to Mr. If he will look at the committee transcripts of the time, he will know that it was the Auditor General's decision to reduce their own budget. The finance committee yesterday, with the support of Liberal backbench MPs who are on that committee, unanimously passed a motion to fund the Auditor General in full so that her office can do her job. If this minister will not listen to me, will he at least listen to his own backbenchers? hon. Chair, our government is fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the Auditor General, an independent officer of Parliament. If the Auditor General identifies the need for additional resources, we will work with the Office of the Auditor General to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue fulfilling their mandate efficiently and effectively. Chair, the Auditor General has consistently, since 2018, told this government that the office doesn't have enough funds. It's the first time in history that the Auditor General has had to tell public accounts that they don't have the resources to do their job. When will this government actually do the right thing and fully fund the Office of the Auditor General? hon. If the Auditor General identifies a need for additional resources, we will work with her to ensure that her office can continue to deliver its mandate efficiently and effectively. With this increase, the office was able to add the equivalent of 38new full-time staff to its team. I would ask the minister to please stop with the platitudes and actually just say yes or no. Chair, we have already increased the budget of the Office of the Auditor General in the 2018-19 period. the chair: Before we continue, we're going to suspend for a second to bring in the next chair. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): There's a point of order. It's always customary to give members a chance to correct the record, so I call upon the minister to do so now, and perhaps even the Prime Minister. I have here the transcripts of the public accounts committee, and they will confirm that the the acting chair (mrs. I would also like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague and friend, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. While Quebec estimates its additional health care costs related to COVID-19 at $3billion, Ottawa is transferring around $115million, which is not even4%. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, as the member opposite knows, we invested an initial $500 million in transfers to the provinces and territories to manage the extreme pressure put on health care systems as a result of their supporting people living with COVID and in preventing COVID. We want to thank the provinces and territories for their work, and as the member opposite knows, we will continue to be there for the provinces and territories. The government is giving about $115million to Quebec, but that is not even 4%of what is being requested. patty hajdu: We have been working with the provinces and territories from the beginning to respond to the crisis. We have been able to make so much progress in the fight against COVID-19 precisely because of this co-operation. gabriel ste-marie: MadamChair, it isn't about squabbling, it's about needs. What we're seeing today are the results of massive disinvestment by the federal government in health care. Can the government commit to better funding to the health care sector and to organizing a meeting with Quebec and the provinces on this exact topic, in September at the latest? We can't afford to wait. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, with respect to the transfers to provinces and territories, the member opposite knows that our government, in our last mandate, significantly increased transfers to the provinces and territories for health services, including mental health and home care services. In fact, the funding we're providing is in addition to the $40 billion that was transferred the acting chair (mrs. alexis brunelle-duceppe (lac-saint-jean, bq): Thank you, MadamChair.   Tudo bem? Tudo bom?  Today in La Presse, we learned that the government has extended its military presence in long-term care homes. Can the minister confirm this information, and can he also confirm that the presence of these 500soldiers is indeed in response to a request from the Government of Quebec? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, let me assure the member that when Quebec made a request for assistance at the beginning of April, we answered the call. I had a conversation today with Minister Guilbault, my counterpart in Quebec, and we have renewed our commitment to continuing to provide assistance. That assistance can take additional forms and can include involving the Canadian Red Cross, but we remain committed to providing the assistance that Quebec needs. alexis brunelle-duceppe: If I understand correctly, negotiations are still under way with the Government of Quebec, even though it needs these soldiers. We have to make sure that the military will stay in our long-term care homes as long as we need their services in Quebec, and until new attendants have been trained. bill blair: I'd like to assure this House that we have assured Quebec that the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to provide support until such time as other trained professional people are able to do that job. We will be there for Quebeckers because they need our help, and as long as they need our help, we'll be there to support them. alexis brunelle-duceppe: This isn't the time to play cat-and-mouse. The only thing we have to do is to give the Government of Quebec what it's asking for. Quebec has more than 5,000deaths from COVID-19, 90%of which have been in seniors' residences or long-term care homes. Will the minister commit to extending the mission now and putting an end to this uncertainty? It's certainly bad for both the military and the health care workers, who rely on this support. We have made a commitment to the Province of Quebec that we will continue to provide that support until the middle of September, exactly as they have requested, but we are also working to ensure that we have an sustainable, effective solution to the request that Quebec has made, so we're working with the Province of Quebec, the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian Red Cross to ensure the help that is needed is there. Madam Chair, COVID-19 continues to create challenges for all Canadians, including those with disabilities, and exacerbates those experienced by Canadians with disabilities. As we mark the end of National AccessAbility Week, I would like to remind our colleagues that our commitment to making Canada more inclusive and equitable is ongoing, including our passing of the Accessible Canada Act. Would the minister inform the House about the government's plans to support Canadians with disabilities who are experiencing increased costs due to COVID-19? hon. carla qualtrough (minister of employment, workforce development and disability inclusion): Madam Chair, last week was the first National AccessAbility Week that was legislated under the historic Accessible Canada Act, and I thank every party in this House for the consent they gave to that legislation. I'm hoping we have the same spirit of camaraderie for people with disabilities this afternoon. Since the beginning, Madam Chair, we have taken a disability inclusion approach on how we support people with disabilities in this time of pandemic, including the establishment of our COVID-19 disability advisory group, which has given us invaluable advice. Last week we announced a suite of measures to support people with disabilities that complement existing measures that are in place. This includes a one-time payment of $600 to 1.25 million citizens with disabilities, which again is the subject matter of the legislation this afternoon, as well as a $15-million investment in an accessible workplace initiative that will ensure, moving forward.... Finally, there are five really exciting accessible technology initiatives, including working on point-of-sale terminals for Canadians who are blind or visually impaired. bryan may: I want to take this opportunity to thank the minister and her department for all the work they are doing to ensure that accessibility is at the forefront of everybody's mind through this crisis. shaun chen (scarborough north, lib.): Madam Chair, as humanity battles COVID-19, we are confronted by the stark realities of another disease. On May 25, George Floyd fell unconscious and died as a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. This all happened after the 46-year-old black man was handcuffed and put in a position where he could do no harm. In Canada, we have come a long way since Viola Desmond, yet there is much more to do. Hatred has no boundaries, whether it is against black communities or is anti-Asian sentiment fuelled by COVID-19. The question always is this: Who is next? We must all stand up together against hatred and for justice and reconciliation, to dismantle systems of oppression that long remained unquestioned. Recent data from Statistics Canada shows that Canada is failing black youth, creating the conditions that push them into the justice system. To the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, my question is this: What is the government doing to address the unique challenges faced by black youth? hon. bardish chagger (minister of diversity and inclusion and youth): Madam Chair, the member for Scarborough North is absolutely correct. We often say that today's youth are not only the leaders of tomorrow but the leaders of today, so we need to equip them for success by investing in youth. According to the 2016 census, black Canadians accounted for 1.2 million people, and more than a quarter of that population is under the age of 15. Socio-economic gaps, such as in employment and education, exist between black and non-black youth. We have Canada's first youth policy, and it was created by youth for youth to ensure that all young people are equipped to live healthy and fulfilling lives, and are empowered to create positive change for themselves and their communities. Our government launched the community support for black Canadian youth program, which supported 56 projects geared to address the unique challenges faced by black Canadian youth through the development of leadership skills and civic engagement, while empowering them through the promotion of black history, culture and identity. To address the challenges of the pandemic, our government has implemented a suite of measures designed to help youth and students, including with employment and service opportunities. My office is working with community organizations who serve black youth to make sure they too are both aware of and benefiting from these measures. Will the government bring in legislation that would enshrine into law access to, and federal funding for, quality affordable child care? hon. ahmed hussen (minister of families, children and social development): Madam Chair, we are, of course, committed to investments in child care. We have constantly worked with provinces and territories to ensure that we provide the supports they need to provide quality, affordable and accessible child care. We are committed to creating an additional 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces. lindsay mathyssen: The government doesn't seem to understand that this is not universal child care. During COVID-19, women have lost the majority of jobs, and they have taken on the majority of additional child care responsibilities. Canadian women want and need to return to work, but this government doesn't understand that without affordable child care, they simply cannot re-enter the workforce. For 26 years, Liberal governments have been promising, but failing to deliver, a universal child care program. Since 2015, we have created 40,000 affordable, accessible, quality child care spaces across the country. We are on track to continue to invest $7.5 billion over 11 years to create additional child care spaces and support provinces and territories. We will be there for parents as they get back to work, and we will continue to reinforce the early learning and child care sector. Instead of helping parents return to work, the government is now bringing forward legislation that's penalizing them. Why is the government looking to sentence mothers and fathers to jail time and large fines when they cannot find the child care that the acting chair (mrs. It's an honour to be here, and I'm hoping that you and your family stay safe at this time. COVID has shaken up Canada's middle class, so my question is for the Minister of Middle Class Prosperity. She runs her own business, a travel agency, but because of COVID she has been wiped out. Will the minister fight for an extension of CERB so this woman can stay in the middle class? hon. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, we know how worried Canadians are as they see their final four-week period of the CERB approaching, and we're working very hard to ensure that the CERB continues to serve an important purpose as we move into economic recovery. Now we're asking people to go back to work if it's safe for them to do so. In fact, the measures in today's legislation will help us to get the flexibility to be able to do just that. We need a Minister of Middle Class Prosperity in a time of middle-class disparity, and she has talked about middle-class criminality. Will the minister assure us that this man will be able to stay in the middle class because the CERB will still be there in July, yes or no? hon. mona fortier: MadamChair, since the beginning of the crisis, we've been helping Canadians by putting programs in place. charlie angus: The issue here is that when COVID hit, millions of Canadians were living in such precarious working conditions that they didn't even have enough money to pay their rent. What I need to know from the minister, and what Canadians need to know, is whether she will commit, yes or no, that the CERB will be there for those who have no work to go back to. mona fortier: MadamChair, since the beginning of the crisis, we have been helping families with a supplement to the Canada child benefit. It was all the way back on March 25 that the Minister of Finance stated that help for the energy sector was coming within hours, possibly days. Seventy-seven days after the minister made that statement, not a single energy company has received financing under EDC, the BDC, or the LEEFF program. As the energy sector faces an unprecedented liquidity crisis, how can this government possibly justify such a delay? hon. seamus o'regan (minister of natural resources): Madam Chair, weeks ago we opened applications through the business credit availability program to support the small and medium-sized players that make up 85% of the jobs in our sector. We've also opened applications for measures that will be available to our larger players through our LEEFF program. We will continue to support workers, and we will continue to do so to get through this unprecedented challenge. michael cooper: Madam Chair, on June 2, the vice-president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said, The entire industry is frustrated with the delay that we are facing. The Saskatchewan Minister of Energy and Resources has spoken about a gaping hole that exists in terms of support for the energy sector. The gaping hole that I'm speaking of is the EDC and BDC programs that this government has failed to deliver upon. Indeed, it was on April 17 that those programs were announced, and 54 days later, not only has not a single energy company received financing, but guess what? They can't even apply, and the eligibility criteria have yet to be finalized after 54 days. seamus o'regan: Madam Chair, the Business Council of Alberta has said that the LEEFF program is a positive development showing that the federal government recognizes the needs and value of Canada's large corporations. It is essential that we support our oil and gas sector as it suffers through two crises: the impacts of COVID and the effects of a global price war initiated by Russia and Saudi Arabia. That's why, weeks ago, we opened applications for liquidity measures to support the small and medium-sized players that make up 85% of the jobs in our sector. michael cooper: Madam Chair, contrary to the representations of the minister, neither the EDC program nor BDC programs are accepting applications. Just yesterday officials from both BDC and EDC were before the finance committee, where I posed precisely those questions to them. We know, Madam Chair, that the application process isn't up and running and that eligibility criteria remain to be determined, but I guess this government has some good news for the energy sector after 77 days. Is that the kind of help the Minister of Finance had in mind after 77 days: email updates instead of real relief for the energy sector? hon. seamus o'regan: Madam Chair, the Alberta finance minister, Travis Toews, said in a LEEFF announcement that in combination with earlier measures for small and medium-sized companies, it represented an expression of confidence in our industries. It is essential that we support our oil and gas sector as it suffers through these two crisesas I said, the impact of COVID, and then on top of that, the effect of a global price war. We supported small and medium-sized players essential to the supply chain, who make up 85% of the jobs in that sector, and then we announced liquidity made available to our larger players through the LEEFF program. alexandra mends): I now have to interrupt for a few moments to allow our technicians to change places. richard martel (chicoutimile fjord, cpc): MadamChair, there has recently been positive progress in AndrGauthier's case, and I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Deputy Prime Minister for their co-operation in this matter. However, Mr.Gauthier is currently on his own in the United Arab Emirates, without a passport, waiting to settle civil lawsuits. What services does the minister intend to provide to help him, and when does he plan to repatriate AndrGauthier to Canada? hon. marc garneau: MadamChair, in all cases similar to Mr.Gauthier's, the Government of Canada, through its consular services, tries to do the best it can under the circumstances. richard martel: The House recognized on February18, 2020, that the 15weeks of sickness benefits provided by employment insurance were insufficient. They are being denied the CERB because they didn't lose their jobs because of COVID-19. In addition, some citizens are waiting for surgery, which is being delayed because of COVID-19. Of course, we understand that people who are no longer receiving EI benefits should have access to the CERB. richard martel: I've called on the Minister of Economic Development several times to be more flexible in establishing these programs, so that they are better adapted to the realities of the regions. Recently, it was the SMEs in Montreal that were monopolizing the funds earmarked for the regions. When will the Liberal government listen to the needs of regions like SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean? hon. mlanie joly: I thank my colleague for the opportunity to announce the good news that was mentioned on Radio-Canada this morning, namely, $71million more for the regions of Quebec. I will be happy to work with my colleague to ensure that the CFDC in his region can support businesses. According to a survey conducted by the Universit de Trois-Rivires in Quebec, the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region is apparently the most economically affected by COVID-19. Our region has forestry, the aluminum sector, GNL Qubec, tourism, the Port of Saguenay, Davie Canada, a military base and a tax centre. I'd like to tell my colleague that there will be other announcements to support the economic development of the beautiful region of SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean. richard martel: Sustainable forestry development is at the heart of the economic development of Canada and for SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean. Canadians have reason to be proud of the use of the boreal forest in the fight against climate change. Currently, our innovative forest industry is experiencing many problems, and on top of that, there is the COVID-19 crisis. I will also be pleased to work with my colleague, the Minister of Natural Resources, who is very familiar with the matter and who knows the challenges faced by the various businesses in the forestry sector, as well as the employees. We are hearing from women who are pregnant or who have just given birth and are being left out or told to go back to work. carla qualtrough: We know that there are many situations of Canadians who are about to or are just going on maternity or parental benefits who might not have access to their EI benefits due to not having accumulated enough time for COVID reasons. We're working very hard to make sure, as we did for fish harvesters, that we support all Canadians in these situations. This is something that has been brought to the government's attention for months now, and still nothing has been done. Had the government conducted a GBA+ analysis, they would have discovered this prior to rolling out inadequate programs for women. carla qualtrough: I can assure everyone in this House that we are very aware and deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of this pandemic on women and girls. As we move forward, we are, as I said earlier, taking into consideration improvements to the EI system, the wage subsidy and the future of CERB. jag sahota: Madam Chair, might I remind my honourable colleague that this Prime Minister said that every piece of legislation would go through a rigorous GBA+? Why was it not done? hon. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, I can assure the member that we absolutely took into account the needs of women as we developed the CERB. jag sahota: Madam Chair, it is a simple question, and I will ask again. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, as I said, the needs of women and girls were taken into consideration every step of the way, from the beginning, as we worked to provide a comprehensive suite of support for Canadians across the country. jag sahota: Madam Chair, if that's the case, then how did you miss these gaps? hon. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, I can assure the member that we didn't miss gaps. As we moved from supporting workers to supporting students to supporting seniors, and today to supporting people with disabilities, we are ensuring that everyone is covered by our measures. As this pandemic evolves and as we move into economic recovery, of course we're going to make sure that women in particular are supported in our measures. I'm very proud of how many senior women we have supported with our measures, how many women received the GST credit, how many women who lead families received the CCB one-time payment and how many women with disabilities will receive the disability support if we have all-party consent today. jag sahota: Madam Chair, I will ask again, hoping for a straightforward answer from this minister. I'll say again how important it was from the very beginning that we took into account the needs of women and girls, and as we move forward into the economic recovery phase, how completely we make women at the core of every decision. Why was a GBA+ analysis not conducted on the COVID-19 relief programs? the acting chair (mrs. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, we've taken into account the needs of women and girls from the beginning, and we'll continue to do so. colin carrie (oshawa, cpc): Madame Chair, on April 29 I asked Minister Blair why Lisa Freeman, a constituent of mine, wasn't able to participate in the Parole Board hearing of her father's murderer. The minister acknowledged that this had been a mistake and that victims would now be able to attend by telephone and video conference. Can the minister tell this House how many parole hearings have been conducted under this digital format with victims since April 29? hon. I'm glad to hear that Minister Blair was able to provide information on the specific case he raises. colin carrie: Madame Chair, on April 29 the minister said, and I quote, Steps have been taken to make it possible for victims to participate in those parole hearings virtually by phone or video conference. If the change has been made, can the minister please tell us how many hearings victims have been able to participate in by video conference? hon. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, as I said, certainly we will confirm the number of hearings that may have occurred. With regard to the hearings under the Parole Board of Canada, we want to ensure that victims and others are able to participate in a fair and transparent manner. colin carrie: Madame Chair, the website says, To protect the health and safety of the public, offenders, Parole Board...members and staff in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PBC is currently conducting its hearings remotely via video conference or teleconference. However, when referring to victim participation, the PBC says it has Implemented technological and procedural enhancements in order to provide victims...the ability to participate...via telephone. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, as I said, it is very important that all parties be able to participate before the Parole Board. The Parole Board has introduced technologies to allow victims to participate in a manner that is fair and that accords them the opportunity to express themselves. For victims, besides the criminal trial, the Parole Board hearings are the only chance to participate in the judicial process. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, as I've said now on a number of occasions, victims are able to participate in the hearings before the Parole Board. colin carrie: Then, Madam Chair, why did the minister and this government tell Canadians and the House that victims of crime have the opportunity to participate in parole hearings by video conference, when in fact they do not? hon. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, as I've said, of course we are going to confirm the status of that particular request. In the meantime, as I've said on a number of occasions, victims are able to participate in these hearings. When will the minister finally give victims of crime the same right to parole hearings by video conference as he gives convicted inmates? hon. The Parole Board is a well-established tribunal that does allow for all parties, including victims, to participate in a manner that is fair, and that allows them to express themselves so those representations can be taken into account in the decisions of the Parole Board of Canada. colin carrie: He can reject it as much as he wants, Madam Chair, but it seems he thinks it's fair that inmates have that right, but victims don't. On May 19, the Prime Minister announced the government would allow sole proprietors and gig contractors to qualify for the Canada emergency business account; however, Brandon has still not been able to take advantage of this benefit. When can small business owners like Brandon expect this change to finally be made? It's been over three weeks, and the clock is ticking. mary ng (minister of small business, export promotion and international trade): Madam Chair, from the very beginning, we have been working hard to support our small businesses. Shawn and Denise operate a gymnastics facility in Whitby and have been forced to close throughout COVID-19. As the economy begins to open, they are concerned about not having the money to pay their employees in the short term, especially at a reduced client capacity. Is the government extending the wage subsidy to small businesses that have been closed and are just beginning to open now? hon. We hope businesses like that one will be able to take advantage of the wage subsidy to keep their employees on staff. Just to put it on the record, because we may or may not be debating it, the draft embargoed bill that we've seen is unacceptable to members of the Green Party caucus. I certainly appreciate her work and I know her intentions are the best, but part 3 of this bill allows for the information to be shared so people can get a one-time payment of $600, which is not enough to really deal with the COVID crisis for people with disabilities. It's clearand I thank the honourable leader of the New Democratic Party for making this point clearly in question periodit will reach approximately 40% of people with disabilities because of the structure of going through the disability tax credit. To the honourable minister, are other measures under consideration to reach the rest of the people in Canada with disabilities who need help? hon. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, the disability support payment we are proposing and that we hope to get through the House today complements a whole suite of measures our government has put in place that people with disabilities have access to. We know that people with disabilities who were precariously employed are now taking advantage of the CERB. Students with disabilities get the student benefit, including a $750-per-month top-up for four months. All around, Madam Chair, we're trying to get to every citizen with a disability, and this measure fills an important gap. elizabeth may: Much worse than part 3, from our point of view, is the treatment of people who are at this point potentially to be jailed for refusing to return to work when it's considered reasonable and they are recipients of CERB. To the minister, what's reasonable, and in whose eyes is it reasonable? In today's news, Hamilton's chief medical officer says there is a spike in cases among young people, who likely were exposed while taking public transit to get to work. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, as with the current CERB, moving forward it tries to encompass the situations of people who are unemployed, people who can't work because of child care responsibilities, people who are ill or sick. We're trying to look at the person and their particular circumstances as we work to ensure that if someone is immunocompromised and can't take transit to their job, then it's reasonable for them not to take that job. elizabeth may: The approach is so very flawed, Madam Chair, in that it attempts to punish people as opposed to encouraging them. I think the Liberals have been overly influenced by the Conservative Party's cries that there's vast fraud, that Canadians are cheating. The reality is that if you want to create an incentive to go back to work, you don't threaten people. You let people continue to receive CERB, but maybe less as they begin to earn more, so that you have a transition on a sliding scale to go into the wage subsidy or into CERB. I ask the honourable minister this: How can it be considered fair to say that someone isn't eligible, even though they believed they were? The language in this bill, particularly at proposed paragraph 12.1 in the penalties section, is an unreasonable determination that someone has violated the act and is subject to jail time and heavy fines. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, because of parliamentary privilege, I can't and won't speak to specific acts of a piece of law that hasn't actually been introduced in the House, but I'll tell you that what we're trying to do is enhance our integrity measures. We're working with those people who made an honest mistake, those who took advantage of returning to work when they were still receiving the CERB. I'm going to be sharing my time with the member from EsquimaltSaanichSooke. Tourism is a critical part of the economy throughout my riding, and after struggling with years of forest fires and floods, tourism was set to have a record-breaking year in 2020, but the COVID epidemic has burned tourism to the ground, in the words of a local leader. Many of them are small seasonal operations that don't qualify for any of the government's COVID support programs. While funding for ad campaigns is appreciated, these businesses need direct support and they need certainty about that support. Can the finance minister pledge now to provide direct and timely support to tourism businesses in my riding? hon. Yes, we were looking forward to another record-breaking year in 2020, but unfortunately the pandemic happened, and therefore many businesses were impacted. That's why, as a government, we're there to help with the wage subsidy, which has been extended until the end of August, as the tourism sector has been asking us to do; with the CEBA loans, the $40,000 loans, which also include a subsidy; and with the commercial rent relief. One thing that has allowed the wine industry to grow so dramatically in the past few decades is the excise tax exemption. That exemption could likely end very soon if it is found to be non-compliant with our trade agreements. Can he assure this House and the industry that the government will act immediately to implement this program? the acting chair (mrs. We recognize how important the wine industry is in B.C., and I assure the honourable member that I will come back to him and give him an update. randall garrison (esquimaltsaanichsooke, ndp): Madam Chair, this is National Blood Donor Week in Canada. More than 17 other countries have no deferral because they know that behaviour-based screening provides better security for the blood supply than identity-based exclusions. Will the Minister of Health do more than repeat those same promises today and instead take action to get this unscientific and discriminatory gay blood ban lifted? hon. jean-yves duclos (president of the treasury board): Madam Chair, I'm glad to be able to answer this very important question. randall garrison: The government knows I've been calling on friends, family and allies of the gay community to donate blood this week in the place of those of us who cannot. Not only do we need routine blood donations, but to do the research we need on possible prevention and treatment of COVID-19, we urgently need plasma donations from those who have recovered. jean-yves duclos: Madam Chair, I think the member used the right key words in referring to science and more prevention work to make sure that everyone lives in dignity and safety. Although there has been progress in the last few months and years on this important issue, there is more work to be done. randall garrison: Six years ago this week, I tabled a motion in the House that called for an end to this homophobic and transphobic ban on blood donations from gay men, men who have sex with men and trans women. Since we appear to have cross-party support for my new motion, M-41, that I put on the notice paper this week, would the minister and the government agree to support a unanimous consent motion to proceed with M-41 immediately? the acting chair (mrs. Homophobia and transphobia are examples of discrimination and absolutely important things not only to recognize but to fight against. That's why we are pleased to have voices such as the member of Parliament's voice to make sure that we make progress in making sure that everyone in Canada lives in safety and in dignity. maxime blanchette-joncas (rimouski-neigettetmiscouatales basques, bq): MadamChair, I will share my time with the honourable member for LongueuilSaint-Hubert. As Quebec starts to gradually emerge from the general lockdown, the outlook for the recovery of the tourism industry remains bleak. The economy of several regions of Quebec depends on tourism to ensure stability and balance, which will be beneficial in the coming months. Is the Minister of Finance prepared to extend the Canada emergency response benefit beyond 16weeks to ensure a living wage for tourism workers? hon. carla qualtrough: MadamChair, as I said in English, we're working very hard to continue to be there for all Canadians, whether it's through the CERB or the Canada emergency wage subsidy. We're going to have news on this very soon, Madam Chair, but the point is that we want to make sure that all of these programs work well together, whether it's the wage subsidy or the CERB. We want to make sure that we incentivize work, but we still continue to be there for Canadians. maxime blanchette-joncas: We read that the government wants to gradually replace the Canada emergency response benefit by using the Canada emergency wage subsidy. That's all well and good, but seasonal industries aren't entitled to it under the current criteria. If the minister is aware of the importance of the tourism industry in the economic cycle of our regions, he must commit to helping workers. We simply need to make it an employment incentive so as not to hurt people who are lucky enough to be able to go back to work. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, we are working hard to make sure we continue to support Canadians as we transition through economic recovery. We want to make sure that we support Canadians, but of course we don't want to disincentivize work. We want to make sure that as we ask people to go back to work, we don't disincentivize work, but the reality is that there won't be jobs there for everyone, and we need to continue to support everyone. denis trudel (longueuilsaint-hubert, bq): MadamChair, I join my colleague in extending my good wishes to you on Portugal's national day. Apart from the fact that it is probably the most beautiful riding in Quebec, the riding of LongueuilSaint-Hubert has surely been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, both in terms of health and the economy. But we aren't close to being able to go back and see a show by WajdiMouawad or FredPellerin, and that's a shame. steven guilbeault: MadamChair, I thank my colleague for his question and all the work he's doing in arts and culture. We introduced the Canada emergency response benefit, for example, but also the emergency wage subsidy, which we made available to non-governmental organizations. To ensure that people who receive royalties aren't penalized under the Canada emergency response benefit, we have adapted it. Instead of giving a long preamble, I'll ask a very simple question: will the CERB be extended on July5? the acting chair (mrs. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, I can assure the member opposite that in July we will be there for Canadian workers. denis trudel: In my riding, a nice little restaurant called Crpe Caf on St-Charles Street in Longueuil has just closed its doors. Another restaurant owner told me that he was going to reopen his restaurant, but he didn't know at what capacity. How many hours a week will it be able to offer its employees? Will it be 12hours, 15hours, 22hours? Will employees even want to return to work to put in 12hours a week? If the CERB isn't adjusted, nothing will happen. Will the government commit to extending the CERB and providing an employment incentive to get the economy moving again at full speed? hon. mlanie joly: MadamChair, I know, of course, that the restaurant sector has been much affected. If my colleague wants to work with me to provide support to restaurant owners and other restaurants in Longueuil, I'd be very happy to do so. richard bragdon (tobiquemactaquac, cpc): Madam Chair, last month, on May 5, I asked the government how it plans to support the agriculture sector. Now, one month later, our farmers, who provide the food we need, are still waiting on funds to be delivered. The New Brunswick potato industry is sitting on a massive amount of last year's crop that, because of the pandemic, has no buyers. When will the Prime Minister and the government step up and deliver the support our farmers so desperately need? hon. In addition to that, we have provided relief and support for migrant workers, who are ensuring that Canadians have access to safe and affordable food. richard bragdon: Madam Chair, when support for the agriculture sector was announced on May 4, our agriculture sector had been sounding the alarm for weeks that they needed help to continue to meet Canadians' food needs. It is worth noting, Madam Chair, that vegetables like the potatoes in New Brunswick that I previously mentioned are perishable products. Again, will the Prime Minister and this government make agriculture a priority and provide them with the support they desperately need right now? hon. mlanie joly: Madam Chair, obviously we believe in the importance of our regions and our rural communities, and that's why we've always made sure that agriculture was at the core of many of the decisions throughout this pandemic. That's why our colleague Minister Bibeau, who is the Minister of Agriculture, has been there providing the right liquidity and the right support through this pandemic. Of course we want to make sure that we continue to partner with provinces and territories, because we need their help in this context to make sure that all together we show strong economic support for our farmers, who are going through tough times. richard bragdon: On May 1 the Liberals introduced a sweeping firearms ban through an order in council that outlawed 1,500 firearms. Recent reports show that since then, more and more firearms are quietly being added to the list of banned firearms, including many common hunting rifles and shotguns. Madam Chair, our hunters, outfitters, dealers and sport shooters are some of the most vetted members of our society. Why does the Prime Minister insist on making criminals out of law-abiding firearms owners instead of dealing with the criminals we already have? hon. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, I am very proud of this government's record when it comes to ensuring that we take out of our communities those guns that have one objective only, and that is to kill other people. We will always stand by that record, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to keep our communities safe. richard bragdon: Madam Chair, the Liberals have said that to compensate firearms owners, they will implement a national buyback program. Instead of targeting law-abiding firearms owners and their legally purchased private property, wouldn't the estimated quarter of a billion dollars needed to buy back these firearms be better utilized right now in supporting our agricultural sector, the very people who grow our food and literally keep our land? hon. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, of course we look forward to saying more about that, but of course we remain committed to taking those guns that have only one objective, and that is to kill people. The legislation we have introduced and the measures we have taken are designed to keep our communities safe, and of course we will do that. We will also continue to support farmers, introducing hundreds of millions of dollars in support because we know they are providing Canadians with affordable food. richard bragdon: Madam Chair, many sole proprietors have been hit extremely hard by this pandemic. My office has heard from many who have been in business for nearly 30 years and have submitted hundreds of HST returns, yet still cannot access the CEBA funding because they do not have a business chequing account, as a lot of small business owners use their personal chequing accounts to do their business. The Liberals offered aid to sole proprietors but attached unnecessary hurdles that prevent many of them from accessing the funds they desperately need to keep their businesses afloat. When will these unnecessary hurdles be removed so businesses can start to receive the relief they so desperately need? the acting chair (mrs. mlanie joly: We believe in the importance of making sure we're supporting our businesses, including sole proprietors. That is why our colleague, Minister Ng, the minister for small business, has been working on this and will continue to make sure we take the appropriate steps to recognize that. Meanwhile, people can definitely come to the regional development agencies if they don't have access to funding through banks, and that's a good way to make sure there is a backstop. alexandra mends): Please note that, pursuant to the Standing Order made on April20 and May26, the House has been recalled. Therefore, the committee will adjourn, and the House will begin sitting at 2:30p.m"

        "Query": "Summarize the difficulties faced by secondary schools in carrying out curriculum reform, the opinions on support or changes of circumstances, the stress faced by the oil and gas industry, and the discussion about restoring Canadian businesses during the pandemic. Additionally, provide insights on the perspectives of Heather McPherson and Chrystia Freeland on restoring Canadian businesses during the pandemic.",
        "Summary": "Despite some primary schools having surplus funds, many secondary schools are facing deficits and a lack of funds. Additionally, there is a shortage of teachers with appropriate training. Concerns arise regarding the ability of lower-tier schools to adapt to the new curriculum and improve teaching quality. The approach to students has not changed, but individual circumstances may require adjustments from the Student Loans Company. Challenges in service delivery may arise due to staff shortages caused by illness, self-isolation, or adherence to social-distancing measures. Early monitoring was implemented due to the presence of campuses and activities in China and Southeast Asia. The oil and gas industry has been heavily impacted by anti-oil and gas lobby groups, resulting in the introduction of bills that restrict major projects and oil shipping. These actions have caused a significant decline in investment and a recession in the Alberta economy. Members express concerns about the government's handling of pandemic-related restrictions, particularly in relation to reopening businesses and providing effective stimulus. They emphasize the need to reopen fishing, restore agricultural supply chains, and support farmers. Questions are raised about the government's response to outbreaks in meat-packing plants and the provision of financial support to workers in unsafe conditions. The government is also questioned about providing pandemic relief funds to businesses utilizing tax havens. Hon. Chrystia Freeland acknowledges the hard work of farmers and emphasizes the importance of a safe working environment, trusting the Food Inspection Agency to regulate conditions.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the sixth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 pandemic. members that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel; if you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel; and should you wish to alternate between the two languages, as I just did, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking, each time you switch languages. In addition, please direct your remarks through the chair and speak slowly and clearly at all times to help our interpreters. I recommend the headset for your fellow members, but also for the interpreters as it gets loud, up and down, and it squeaks. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we will proceed to presenting petitions, for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. World Maternal Mental Health Day took place last week, and today I'd like to take a moment to present a very important petition on behalf of the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative. Whereas perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are the most common obstetrical complication, whereas in Canada and worldwide 20% of women and 10% of men suffer from a perinatal mental illness, resulting in an annual economic cost to Canada of approximately $11 billion, and whereas the U.K., Australia and parts of the U.S. have perinatal mental health strategies and screening guidelines in place and Canada does not, the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative is calling upon the House of Commons in Parliament assembled to create a national perinatal mental health strategy that will provide direction, policy and funding to develop specialized, comprehensive perinatal mental health care services, which include universal screening and timely access to treatment for all women and men during pregnancy and the postpartum period. If we were in the House now, as May is Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month, one of the days this month we would all be wearing yellow roses in sympathy and solidarity with those who suffer from what is the number one disease killer in Canada of young people. The petitioners have asked us to look at the situation with the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which is scheduled to go through some important and potentially detrimental regulatory changes very soon. They ask that the amendments to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board be rescinded, as these will restrict Canadians from receiving life-saving medications for cystic fibrosis and other illnesses, but in particular, a medicine called Trikafta, which can have the effect of treating cystic fibrosis in the case of 90% of cystic fibrosis sufferers. They ask the government to work with the provinces to find a strategy to jointly allow for the delivery of this life-saving medicine to Canadians across the country and to take a leadership role in negotiating a price for gene modulators throughout all the provinces of Canada. Petitioners in my community point out in this petition, which, of course, predates the pandemic, that the family doctor shortage is severe in this country. This problem is particularly profound in more rural areas, including, as the petitioners reference, the community in which I live, Sydney, British Columbia. The petitioners call on the government to work with provinces and territories to find a collaborative, holistic solution so that every Canadian has a family doctor and we address the family doctor shortage. I'm presenting a timely petition today that emphasizes the concerns constituents in my riding of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon have with the Liberal government's inherently flawed and undemocratic approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed RCMP-vetted Canadians; to focus taxpayer dollars where they will actually increase public safety, which is on keeping at-risk youth from being involved in gangs and on anti-gang enforcement; and to provide our men and women in uniform at the Canada Border Services Agency with the resources they need to stop the flow of illegal guns into this country. Through this petition, my constituents take issue with how the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal weapons smugglers responsible for the violence in our communities. They note that the use of the phrase military-style assault rifle is purely political posturing, as the term is undefined in Canadian law. They also draw attention to the numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation the chair: I'd like to remind the honourable members that this is a concise prcis of what a petition says, not a speech. It's a huge honour to table e-petition 2512, which was signed by 1,198 petitioners, primarily from the province of Nova Scotia. The Province of Nova Scotia invited multinational companies to scope out and develop expansive open-net salmon farming operations. The petitioners cite that the expansion would increase environmental degradation, as seen in similar aquaculture operations in British Columbia, Newfoundland, Norway, Vietnam and elsewhere in the world. It also, they cite, would pose risks to native fish stocks, pollute coastal ecosystems, impair at-risk wild Atlantic salmon, and threaten established fisheries and tourism operations. They also raise concerns that open-net fish farming would not create significant employment and would undermine existing lobster and other fisheries. They are calling on the government to uphold Bill C-68 and species-at-risk legislation, protect our oceans, ban expansion of open-net finfish aquaculture in our oceans, work to phase out any existing open-net fish farming operations currently in place and, lastly, invest in land-based, closed-containment finfish aquaculture. I want to thank these petitioners for fighting for clean oceans, for their local economy and for the well-being of Nova Scotia. It calls upon the House of Commons to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on Wet'suwet'en territory, ordering the RCMP to dismantle its exclusion zone and stand down, scheduling nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentssomething that has already happened, thankfullyand prioritizing the real implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. yasmin ratansi (don valley east, lib.): Thank you, Mr. The petitioners are asking that the Government of Canada not provide any financial assistance to Canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to COVID-19. dan albas (central okanagansimilkameennicola, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Today we've learned that federal workers have been told to ignore obvious signs of fraud when it comes to applying for government benefits. Can the Prime Minister confirm that 200,000 applications have been flagged as potentially fraudulent? right hon. We moved very quickly to get the Canada emergency response benefit out, to get the wage subsidy out and to help Canadians in this unprecedented situation. Chair, can the Prime Minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent? This is important. Our decision from the very beginning was to get the help out to people and figure out, with retroactive action if necessary, where and when there may have been fraudulent use. justin trudeau: Again, in this unprecedented situation, our focus has been on helping as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. Other parties might have made a different choice had they been in government, but our focus was getting help to people when they needed it as quickly as possible and cleaning it up afterwards. Did the Prime Minister or his minister sign off on this memo that was issued by the deputy minister, yes or no? right hon. Chair, we have been focused entirely on getting help to Canadians when they need it, and that has meant that yes, there will be things we will need to clean up after the fact and work to fix, but getting that help into Canadians' pockets during this pandemic was our priority. Will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud, or will he write them off, as the story said? right hon. Chair, in this unprecedented situation Canadians have lost their jobs; they've lost their paycheques; they don't know how they're going to be able to support their loved ones and pay for their groceries. We made a decision as a country that we would be there for them and that has been and will continue to be our priority. Will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud, the fraud will be pursued? right hon. All along we've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact, and we expect that to happen. justin trudeau: When we made the determination that we needed to move quickly to help Canadians, we knew there would be a need to clean up after the fact, to go after fraudulent cases. Our priority now and in the coming months is to ensure Canadians get the support they need, and our economy comes roaring back. gabriel ste-marie (joliette, bq): Mr.Chair, yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the large employer emergency financing facility. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent! Unfortunately, I quickly became disillusioned because it is more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs. gabriel ste-marie: Mr.Chair, I'm delighted to hear the Prime Minister say that there's no tolerance for tax avoidance. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, when we announced the large employer emergency funding facility, we recognized that those who wanted to receive tax dollars had to have paid their fair share of taxes. That's why we're putting in place measures to carefully assess the tax structures of these businesses before we loan money to them. gabriel ste-marie: Mr.Chair, sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in Canada and register them in a subsidiary in the Bahamas, Barbados or another tax haven. Does the Prime Minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in Canada? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will assess applications for the large employer emergency funding facility on a case-by-case basis. Before we provide any money, we're going to make sure that whoever wants to access these funds is transparent about how the money is being managed, including internationally. Consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards, which allows contactless payments in shops, not to mention online shopping. This benefits Visa and Mastercard, which charge appallingly high user fees, known as interchange fees. These are almost 10times higher than in Europe and Australia, and it costs our merchants a fortune. Can the Prime Minister follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping interchange fees at0.3%? right hon. We have worked with the big banks and the financial industry to ensure that people who need it have access to the help they need. Right now, we're sending money to consumers across the country who need it to get through this crisis. A credit card company, such as Visa and Mastercard, that charges a fee of 2.5%to3% per transaction undermines the merchant's profit margin and gets richer at the expense of consumers. I invite the Prime Minister to follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping these fees at0.3%. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation. Instead of providing a universal direct payment for all, the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind. A single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic? right hon. Chair, to correct the honourable member by pointing out that we actually moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit. However, as the member points out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and that's why we've been working diligently to try to fill those gaps. jenny kwan: While the Minister of Employment has been aware of this for three weeks and says she is looking into it, there's still been no action. The truth of the matter is that single parents and their children who depend on spousal support and child maintenance are not getting support. justin trudeau: We recognize the particular challenge faced by families, single parents and families with young children, which is why we increased the amount of the Canada child benefit to be able to support people in this particular moment. On top of that, we have looked to fill further gaps that have existed with the Canada emergency response benefit. Well over seven million Canadians have access to CERB, and we will continue to work with them ms. Across the country there is no national standard to address the homelessness crisis amidst this pandemic, leaving communities at heightened risk from COVID-19. Canadians who are homeless or living in substandard housing have no access to bathroom facilities for basic hygiene. government has implemented an initiative to house some of the homeless population in empty hotels in the short term, support from the federal government is needed to secure permanent solutions post-COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister commit to providing matching funds and take the right to adequate housing seriously? right hon. justin trudeau: I know that the honourable member wouldn't want to inadvertently mislead the House. The fact is, the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities, including renting new spaces, to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of COVID-19. I recognize there's always more to do, but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy, we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians, and we will continue to do that. Cutting chronic homelessness by 50% over the next decade is not good enough, and that is this Prime Minister's national housing strategy. Will the government stop just making empty promises and ensure that every Canadian has the right to housing? Will he top up the support for provinces to at least match their funds? right hon. Chair, cutting chronic homelessness by 50% is an ambitious goal that no one else has ever been able to do as a government, and we are well on track for it. I would suggest that the member opposite not dismiss that as an empty promise, because we have demonstrated actions on it. jenny kwan: I would remind the Prime Minister that it was the federal Liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993, so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the Liberals. We in Vancouver East have the third-largest urban indigenous population in the country, yet we got less than 2% of the pandemic urban indigenous housing funding. We have moved forward, both through the Minister of Indigenous Services and the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations. We will continue to work with them, recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in Canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government, and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years. Chair, I'm hearing in my riding of PortageLisgar that individuals who are dealing with Service Canada through the mail are experiencing delays. In fact, one of my constituents sent documents, including a doctor's note, two months ago on March 12 and is now being told that she must resend them because they've never been opened. Can the government tell us whether this is a widespread problem, and how are they dealing with unopened mail at Service Canada? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in Service Canada to meet the expectations of Canadians. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had unprecedented volumes, but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means. We had to close a number of the centres because of COVID-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of Canadians. candice bergen: Is the minister aware whether this is a widespread problem? Is this happening rarely, or frequently? I'm hearing about it. I know, from many MPs, we are at the front lines of dealing with and helping constituents who are not only wanting to get support but also are trying to get programs unrelated to COVID-19. Chair, the Iver Johnson single-shot rifle is a standard farm gun used by many farmers in my riding, in fact, passed down from generation to generation in some cases. Why are the Liberals making this gun illegal? What's the purpose of banning this particular farm rifle? the chair: The honourable minister. I just wish to advise the member that we worked very closely with the Canadian firearms program, with law enforcement and with their firearms verification to identify the makes, models and variants of nine rifles, all of which had in their earliest provenance a design for military use, for soldiers to use in combat. We're hearing from front-line officers that they are concerned about gangs, drug dealers and illegal weapons being smuggled across the border. They are not concerned with these types of farm rifles that are being used by our farmers and, in some cases, hunters. Chair, we'd like to see the evidence on why the Liberals are once again targeting law-abiding Canadians, ignoring gangsters and drug dealers. bill blair: It's a great opportunity, I think, when the member opposite says what the police are saying. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles, except for law enforcement and military purposes. They said, In our view, these weapons have no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by Canada's military and law enforcement. Chair, we've seen this before, where the Liberals introduced a long-gun registry that cost billions of dollars and did absolutely nothing to stop violent crimes. bill blair: Actually, what I'm saying, and what our regulations say very clearly, is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in Canadian society. Is it true that Canada Revenue Agency employees who process applications for the Canada emergency response benefit, or CERB, have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected, as was pointed out in a national media report today? hon. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): Mr.Chair, our government considers these to be very difficult times for Canadians. We're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries. alain rayes: I repeat my question, which is extremely simple: Is it true that the Canada Revenue Agency sent a memo to its employees asking them to ignore the fraudsters and still send the CERB payments?? hon. diane lebouthillier: I'll finish my response, which was interrupted: Nearly 7.8million Canadians have applied for the Canada emergency response benefit. alain rayes: Yes or no: Did the Canada Revenue Agency send a memo to its employeeswho are doing an exceptional job, I'd like to point outso that they would ignore the 200,000potential cases of fraud that they detected? hon. The federal government website clearly states that if an employee returns to work, the employee must pay back the CERB. Can the Prime Minister tell us whether employees who decide to return to work have to pay back the full $2,000per month, or only $500for week of the month? hon. diane lebouthillier: As I mentioned, we believe that Canadians are going through a very difficult time, and we need to support them. That's what our government is committed to, and that's what we'll continue to do. alain rayes: Mr.Chair, the extremely simple question I am asking the Minister comes from companies and workers. None of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters, even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency. If an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the CERB, must he reimburse $500for each week he works during the month, or the entire $2,000? hon. Chair, I can clarify that Service Canada will work closely with anybody who transitions either from the CERB to the wage subsidy or from the CERB back to employment to ensure that there's no overpayment, but of course that there's no undue hardship on the individual. It seems to me that my question is not complicated: do people have to reimburse $500for each week they work in a month, or the full monthly amount of $2,000? hon. That's why Service Canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them. If an employer complies with the hygiene conditions, can employees still refuse to return to work, and therefore continue to receive the CERB? hon. Chair, I can assure all Canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces, we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe. There are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work, and at the end of the day the CERB is there for workers who aren't working due to COVID-19. jamie schmale (haliburtonkawartha lakesbrock, cpc): Thank you, Chair. The Wet'suwet'en elected chiefs and community members have been excluded from negotiations on a memorandum of understanding affecting land rights and titles. The elected chiefs have issued a press release asking for the government to halt the joint announcement scheduled for May 14 on the MOU until the community has had a chance to look at and understand how the MOU will affect them. Will the minister agree with the democratically elected chiefs and the Wet'suwet'en people they represent and delay any announcement until proper consultation can be completed? the chair: The honourable minister. carolyn bennett (minister of crown-indigenous relations): I want to reassure the member that communication is ongoing with and between our partners on how to go forward on implementing the Wet'suwet'en rights and title with a Wet'suwet'en-led solution. We encourage the leaders to continue their ongoing, necessary and important conversations with their community on how they want to proceed on a path toward implementing their rights and title. As we work to rebuild Canada's relationship with the Wet'suwet'en, we need to give them space for these important discussions. jamie schmale: Minister, is that a yes that the signing will be delayed until the elected chiefs have a chance to look at the agreement? hon. jamie schmale: The current health crisis should not be used as an opportunity to sideline the Wet'suwet'en people and their elected chiefs. The federal government should be bringing the community together rather than actively excluding Wet'suwet'en members. The chiefs are so concerned that they are now calling for the resignation of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations for failure to engage in proper consultations, which has stoked divisions within the community. Will the minister reconsider and put in place a consultation process that honours both their traditional house system and the governance responsibilities of elected chiefs and councils? hon. carolyn bennett: Yet again, it's very important the member understand the engagement must take place and be led by the Wet'suwet'en nation. That means the elected chiefs and the hereditary chiefs need to work with all clan members as they determine how they wish to work with Canada and the Province of British Columbia to implement the rights and title of the Wet'suwet'en people. jamie schmale: I agree that the Wet'suwet'en should have the opportunity to look at the proposed agreement, but we are still seeing news coming out of the elected chiefs and the people they represent that they have not had a thorough chance to look at this proposed agreement. carolyn bennett: I think the member will agree that there's a lot more work to do with all the parties. I believe, in terms of the kind of engagement that has taken place in the feast houses and the notification that took place even before COVID-19, that the work is under way and it will have to be Wet'suwet'en-led in terms of what eventually will be their choice as to how they implement their rights and title. Chair, for two weeks now the Liberals on the indigenous affairs committee have shut down Conservatives and witnesses every time we mention the word Wet'suwet'en. They don't want to talk about the issue, an issue that is very much aggravated by the COVID-19 crisis. I don't believe that there's, at any time, an interest in shutting down discussion or debate. I think, though, that at the COVID committee the issues facing indigenous communities, first nations, Inuit and Mtis around COVID-19 are very important to them. jamie schmale: I would argue with the minister and challenge her to talk to her committee members. Each time Conservatives have brought up the topic of the Wet'suwet'en and the situation happening with the elected chiefs and the people they represent, we have been shut down every single time. carolyn bennett: Again, in a committee, it is the work of the committee and the decision of the committee. I believe the chair and all members want first nations, Inuit and Mtis to be able to keep their communities safe during COVID-19. It has been three months since this pandemic started and the Liberals just got around to announcing help for seniors. I've just had the opportunity to introduce additional measures today wherein we are introducing a one-time special payment for those who receive OAS. stephanie kusie: Nearly two months into living in some form of isolation, watching their retirement savings take a hit and having to take additional health precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, eligible seniors are set to receive a one-time payment of up to $500. deb schulte: I just want to make sure that my honourable colleague remembers that we have already given a GST top-up of almost $375 for single seniors and over $500 for couples. This is in addition to what we've just done today where, as you said, it's $500. stephanie kusie: According to Abacus Data, 69% of Canadians feel that there will be a second wave in the pandemic, and 52% of Canadians believe that there is a shortage of medical equipment, including personal protective equipment. Given these surprising figures, what is the government's plan to bring in enough personal protective equipment, should there be a second wave of the pandemic? hon. anita anand (minister of public services and procurement): Our government is aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies that Canada needs, from a diverse range of suppliers around the world and here at home. We're working directly with businesses across the country to rapidly scale up domestic production capacity to meet current and future needs. At this point, our primary focus is on front-line health care professionals, but we are also exploring federal government assistance in areas of essential services so that PPE exists where workers need it. stephanie kusie: According to Public Services and Procurement Canada, despite 1.8 billion units of PPE being procured, less than 6% of N95 respirator orders have been filled, less than 8% of surgical mask orders have been filled, and just 1.4% of face shield orders have been filled. anita anand: Let me start by saying that we are working in an incredibly difficult and competitive global environment and are procuring millions of items: face shields, gowns, hand sanitizer, and N95 surgical masks, and ventilators every single day. There is a delay in the production of these goods, but we have had many deliveries coming into Canada, including over two million face shields the chair: We'll have to go back to Mrs. stephanie kusie: A national security expert from the University of Ottawa has said that the national emergency strategic stockpile has failed in the current crisis, resulting in some provinces such as Saskatchewan using expired PPE, and provinces such as Alberta using faulty PPE that cause rashes and headaches. What is the government doing to expedite procurement and to counter the risk of faulty PPE, given that 34 of the suppliers are from China, which has already supplied significant faulty PPE? hon. anita anand: I will start by saying that we have multiple supply chains operating at the same time, from China, and domestically, and from the United States and other countries around the world. Our first priority is to make sure that we get safe, effective equipment and supplies into the hands of our front-line health care workers. Given the global supply chains and their competitive nature, this is an ongoing project and we are having success for our front-line health care workers. Ten weeks ago the Minister of Fisheries, in responding to my question in question period, acknowledged that the lobster fishery was being negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and was facing losses of up to 95% of its Asian markets. Chair, on April 28 I asked the minister what she was doing to support harvesters who were left out of the $62.5 million aid package. Can the minister tell us what the government's plan is to directly support seafood harvesters? the chair: The honourable minister. bernadette jordan (minister of fisheries, oceans and the canadian coast guard): Thank you, Mr. We know that the fish and seafood sector has been extremely adversely affected because of COVID-19. We've started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB is available for seasonal workers as well as people who have run out of their fishery EI, but we know that more needs to be done. The fishery enterprises are uniquely structured, which is why we're looking at measures to address the concerns they have. Chair, most fishermen are not eligible for the wage subsidy program due to the stipulation that it cannot be used for employees who are related to their employer. Many fishermen have their wives, their sons, their uncles or their fathers working for them, and sometimes it's the whole family on the boat. Can the minister explain what the government's plan is to support fishermen who do not fit into any actual program and who desperately need direct financial help from the federal government to survive? hon. Chair, we know that, because of the unique structure of fishing enterprises, they are not eligible for many of the supports we have put in place. We have made changes to the CERB to make sure that people who run out of the fishers EI are eligible as well as seasonable workers. We have put in place measures to address processors' concerns so that harvesters continue to have a place to sell their product. I am working with my cabinet colleagues to find solutions, and I hope I will have more to say about that very soon. chris d'entremont: In recent weeks, lobster fishermen in the gulf region of the Maritimes were shocked to read an additional subsection of regulations that was added to their fishing conditions for the 2021 fishing season. This addition was for a catch limitation or quota to which none of the harvesters or advisory members were privy. Can the minister tell us how these detailed regulations managed to get added without her authorization, and can licence-holders expect to see these same regulations in their conditions when their season gets going in the future? hon. Chair, I want to thank the people who brought to my attention the conditions that were put on licences in the gulf. Chair, on Wednesday, February 26, after the death of 23-year-old Chantelle Lindsay from Nova Scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis, I asked the Prime Minister whether the government was going to make Trikafta, which might have saved Chantelle's life, available to Canadians. Now that almost 12 weeks have passed, we understand that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to Health Canada for study. Many of my Conservative colleagues and I have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with Vertex. Can the Minister of Health tell us when this drug will be available to CF patients in Canada? the chair: Honourable minister, the floor is yours. In fact, the majority of people who have applied through the special access program to get access to the drug have received access. chris d'entremont: Mr.Chair, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. In my constituency, tens of thousands of tourists use the ferry between Bar Harbor, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. What is the government planning to do to help the ferry to survive and to resume service next season, if the borders remain closed this summer? hon. mlanie joly (minister of economic development and official languages): I have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague Mr.d'Entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country, and particularly in the Atlantic region. In light of the new funding for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, I will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector. simon-pierre savard-tremblay (saint-hyacinthebagot, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Despite all the upheaval it causes, the crisis we are experiencing, considerable in scope though it is, can also be an opportunity to begin a transition. Many of us in Quebec feel that, when a company knocks on the state's door to ask for assistance, it is totally legitimate for the state to impose conditions before providing its support. We in the Bloc Qubcois feel that there should be a limit, a ceiling, on the assistance provided to large companies, in order to avoid abuses in executive compensation. A few years ago, after the Bombardier affair in QuebecI will not dwell on that because Quebecers are all too familiar with itthree of the four political parties that sat in the National Assembly and that still sit these took a position of that kind. The United States, which, you will agree, is no bastion of socialism, has already implemented similar policies for periods of crisis. According to a report published by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives on January2, the 100highest-paid CEOs in Canada earned 227times more in 2018 than the average worker. Given that inflation was then at 2.3%, it can be said that there was practically no increase. By contrast, the salary increase for CEOs in the same period was 18%, even in cases where the companies suffered losses. Does the government intend to put a ceiling on executive compensation to ensure that they are not the only ones to profits from the support at this time of crisis? The question is clear and I am asking you to give me a clear answer. If I don't get one, I am going to have to demand a new version of the Clarity Act. We know that our approach has to help small and medium-size companies, but also large companies in order to provide a bridge to the end of the crisis. Yes, we do want to make sure that the facility is available for companies that are going to continue to support our economy, to protect their employees, and to make a significant contribution to our communities. We are going to consider the rules and conditions that are needed in order for the facility to be available to the companies, the operations and the employees. Of course, conditions are required to ensure that the facility is available for operations, not for dividends or share buybacks, for example. sgro (humber riverblack creek, lib.): Thank you very much, Mr. In my own riding of Humber RiverBlack Creek, 30% of the population are 65 or older. Can the minister please tell us what our government is doing to ensure that vulnerable seniors get the support they need during this very difficult time? the chair: The honourable minister. Seniors have faced increased costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our government today has responded to that with additional action. We announced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for seniors eligible for GIS. This means there will be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time. Beyond this, we announced $20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that will help seniorsfor example, to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected. We've worked tirelessly on this as well as on other recent measures like the GST credit to help the most vulnerable seniors. I know she's been working extremely hard to make sure that we get some additional announcements over and above all of the ones we have already made, so congratulations. Seniors across the country have been communicating with us and letting us know their needs, and we have been responding. It's always a privilege to have a chance to speak on issues that matter to Canadians, whether it's from the floor of the House of Commons or, indeed, from my house here in Nova Scotia. Like my colleagues, I'd like to thank the staff of the House of Commons for their continued work to make sure that we have this forum to be able to continue the democratic process. I would also quickly like to thank my staff both here locally in KingsHants and in Ottawa for their continued work for my constituents. We have the Kentville Research and Development Centre and the Hants County agricultural exhibition, the longest-standing exhibition in North America. Can the minister specifically provide an update to the House on the measures our government has taken on those two particular commodity groups that are so important in my riding? the acting chair (mr. Last Tuesday I was proud to announce our emergency processing fund for a total of $77.5 million, $50 million for the surplus food program and $125 million through AgriRecovery to support our beef and pork producers. Concerning the dairy sector in particular, I'm hopeful that tomorrow we will get the support of all of the parties to be able to respond to their request for an increase in their loan capacity from $300 million to $500 million. I would like to encourage all farmers to apply to the business risk management programs, including AgriStability, for which we have improved some of the mechanisms. bruce stanton): We'll go on with questions, but I'll also just ask Mr. brian masse (windsor west, ndp): During the COVID-19 pandemic, the State of Michigan has become an epicentre of the outbreak. The border communities of Sarnia and Windsor have higher per capita infection rates than the rest of the province. With the premiers of B.C., Quebec and Ontario opposing the opening of the border at this time, will the restrictions be extended, or is the Prime Minister discussing changing the restrictions? the acting chair (mr. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Let me assure the honourable member that, first and foremost, all decisions about Canada's border are taken by Canadians and with the health and safety of Canadians first and foremost in mind. When it comes to the current agreement's coming up next week, we are in very close conversations with Americans about next steps. chrystia freeland: Let me just be clear that I didn't speak about any changes; I spoke about a very collaborative conversation with our American neighbours about next steps. chrystia freeland: I found during the NAFTA negotiations that negotiations are best not conducted in public, but let me just assure Canadians that the health and safety of Canadians is first and foremost. chrystia freeland: Let me just say that I think the honourable member was actually seeking to know what exactly is being discussed with our American partners. brian masse: Will more information be shared between your government and the American government on Canadians and Americans crossing the border on both sides? hon. chrystia freeland: I'm not sure what the member is alluding to, but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well. brian masse: With border communities having more rates of infection, will they receive additional PPE and financial assistance to deal with the loosening of current border restrictions that is being discussed? hon. chrystia freeland: Let me just emphasize to the honourable member that on a couple of occasions he has implied that a loosening of the current restrictions is being discussed. I'll move to the large commercial banks who are profiteering off or squeezing Canadians during this public crisis. Will the government use its statutory powers and force the banks to offer the credit card relief that Vancity has already done? the acting chair (mr. I would like to say that we recognize the challenges that Canadians face, especially with issues like credit card rates. Most recently, during the COVID-19 crisis, we've negotiated with the banks and encouraged them, and they have come out with reductions in their credit card fees that are significant, and deferrals for customers mr. brian masse: Will you use your statutory powers, yes or no, to do what Vancity has done to help Canadian consumers? hon. We're continuing to work together with banks to make sure that they are giving the kind of support necessary to their customers, and we've seen actions in this regard, supporting customers. brian masse: Why do banks have to profit at higher interest rates on Canadian consumer and retailer exchange rates during COVID-19? hon. Chair, I think it's important to clarify that banks have come forward and given deferrals to customers in trouble and cut their interest by half  Mr. brian masse: Will the minister use his powers if the banks continue to charge Canadian consumers interest rates that are higher than Vancity's? hon. Chair, again, we will continue to work with banks to ensure that they're supporting their customers. What banks have done on credit cards by cutting their fees in half is an important nod in that direction. jacques gourde (lvislotbinire, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Quebec is Canada's biggest producer of hydroelectricity, a renewable energy that is the pride of the Quebec nation. The only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of Quebec, in Ontario, for instance. Will the government show leadership and allow Canada's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor, as we proposed? hon. jacques gourde: Mr.Chair, Canada's dairy processors have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis and the new CanadaU.S.Mexico Agreement, or CUSMA. Will the government commit to granting import permits under CUSMA to Canada's dairy processors, not retailers directly? hon. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation. That is important to Canada and Quebec, and I'm very pleased that we were able to do that. Canada's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers, while contributing $19billion to GDP. Will the minister commit to giving Canada's dairy processors import permits, instead of encouraging American multinationals? hon. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for his question. I fully understand, as we all do, the important role processors play in our system and our country. I can assure the members of the House that we will continue to work with Canadian processors as the agreement comes into force. jacques gourde: Mr.Chair, when it comes to the COVID-19 crisis, what Canadians will remember is that those with access to reliable high-speed Internet will have fared better, feeling less financial strain, than those who are cut off from the rest of the world. Is the government ready to invest in making high-speed Internet available to all Canadians, no matter where they live in the country? hon. jacques gourde: Mr.Chair, the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of Canada's tourism industry. The pain will be felt by thousands of Canadians, who will have to find new jobs in order to survive. Is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens? hon. That is why we're here, providing a helping hand at this difficult time so they can come out the other side. bruce stanton): Continuing with questions, we'll go to the honourable member for SaskatoonUniversity, Mr. With respect to entering Canada, does the government consider spousal reunification as essential travel, yes or no? the acting chair (mr. bill blair: The CBSA has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-Canadian citizen, who has no status in Canada, attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential.  Changing gears a little, all Canadians would agree, or can agree, that the Prime Minister requires suitable accommodation. Why did the government simply not tell Canadians that the Harrington cottage needed to be rebuilt and massively expanded? the acting chair (mr. The work at Harrington Lake is part of a broader program to preserve and maintain and restore all official residences under NCC management, and we will support the NCC in its important work. corey tochor: Was there something in particular that this government did not want Canadians to know about the cottage, or is secrecy all this government knows how to do? hon. corey tochor: Respectfully, Canadians feel misled on this, and we're not clear on what the expenses were, how large an expansion it was the acting chair (mr. Chair, I believe this has absolutely nothing to do with the pandemic, so the questions are out of order, in my opinion. Certainly the scope of the special committee on the COVID-19 pandemic does expect and anticipate that the subject matter will be related to the matter at hand, so I would ask honourable members to continue to keep within those bounds. Of course, members will also know that we're unable to gauge that until members have spoken, so I would ask members to keep on subject. The point I was making was about transparency or lack of transparency that is hurting our efforts with COVID-19. Changing gears onto CERB, who came up with the number for CERB? Why is it $2,000? A senior gets $1,200, people with disabilities get $1,600, and now we've added another ad hoc program on top of those. carla qualtrough: Working collaboratively between ESDC and the Department of Finance, we determined that that would be an appropriate amount, based on what workers were earning and what we anticipated they would need to live on, and what we anticipated they would be losing by way of employment income. corey tochor: I have a really quick question, which I've heard in my office, on charities and non-profits that do not have their own payroll number and are ineligible for the wage subsidy. Does the Prime Minister have a program fix coming so that charities and non-profits can receive the wage subsidy? the acting chair (mr. Chair, we understand the important role that charities and non-profits are playing to help vulnerable Canadians at this difficult time. We have announced supports in the amount of $350 million to ensure that not only do they continue that great work, but also expand it to serve the most vulnerable to get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Chair, last week markets were shocked when leaks regarding the state of our economy came to light before the market even opened. This caused worry to investors at home and abroad about the integrity of our markets and the nature of the leak, which is, in itself, unprecedented. Section 34 of the Statistics Act indicates the following:     Every person who, after taking the oath set out in subsection 6, is guity of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or to impreisonment for a term not exceeing five years or both:       wilfully discloses or divulges directly or indirectly to any person not entitled under this Act to receive the same any information obtained by him in the course of his employment that might exert an influence on or affect the market value of any stocks, bonds or other security or any product or article, or       uses any information described in paragraph for the purpose of speculating in any stocks, bonds or other security or any product or article   My question for the minister is this: Does the government consider this case to be subject to paragraph 34 or 34 and a criminal offence, yes or no? the acting chair (mr. colleague is absolutely right that the current situation with regard to the COVID crisis is deeply problematic, and we want to make sure that any information we share with the Canadian public with regard to economic measures or labour market numbers follows the appropriate process. I can assure him that we are looking into this matter and that Statistics Canada is looking into this issue as well. Going forward, we will ensure that such a breach does not occur again, because it's important that we continue to have the confidence of Canadians during this current health care crisis. navdeep bains: As I have indicated very clearly, what has happened is completely unacceptable. This matter is being looked into, and we want to assure Canadians going forward that the acting chair (mr. ziad aboultaif: In that case, the minister said the matter will be looked into. Basically, my understanding of this case is that Statistics Canada is going to investigate itself, or does the minister think that the government should refer this to the RCMP? hon. navdeep bains: Sorry, could you repeat that question? I had a bit of an issue and could not hear the question. ziad aboultaif: Will Statistics Canada investigate itself or will the government refer this to the RCMP? hon. Those protocols will be followed, and the appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such breaches do not occur going forward. ziad aboultaif: The minister indicated that this will be investigated, but during the investigation into the SNC-Lavalin scandal, the Liberal staff refused to co-operate. navdeep bains: Again, we've been clear that it's important that any such breach be taken seriously. What has happened is unacceptable, and we will ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to make sure that such breaches do not occur going forward. ziad aboultaif: There's no doubt about the general terms, but I need to make sure that the government will commit that its staff will co-operate. The law is very clear, and we will make sure that the process is followed and the law is upheld. david yurdiga (fort mcmurraycold lake, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Before I start my questions, I would like to thank the various ministers, parliamentary secretaries and the Speaker of the House for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in Fort McMurray. Over the past number of years, we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down. The federal Liberal government's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill, Bill C-69, which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada; and the oil shipping ban, Bill C-48, for the northern coast of British Columbia, which also had a negative effect on the oil industry. These two bills alone pushed over $200 billion of investment out of Canada, causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels. To compound Alberta's economic problems, we have an international oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a huge drop in demand for oil. Chair, 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies, there are still no applications open for these loans. Chair, I'm happy that we were able to announce today some liquidity measures for large cap corporations in the oil and gas sector. These measures will provide them with the liquidity that they needed, and this is also the liquidity that they asked for. It was on April 17 that we started liquidity measures for small and medium-sized businesses in the oil and gas industry, and those are the ones in which 85% of workers are affected. I'm very happy that we've had such people as the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers come out and say that this is what they asked for and this is what they need, and we have produced what they need in order to ensure the future competitiveness of Canada's oil and gas sector. Many of these contractors are indigenous companies, and they are having a difficult time qualifying for programs to save their businesses. Can the honourable Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations inform us of the measures the government is taking to ensure there are no gaps in the current programs, and commit to review the eligibility criteria for owners of aboriginal businesses struggling to qualify for financial help? hon. Chair, Canada's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people, including 11,000 indigenous people, in every part of Canada. It is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan. We have provided supports for those businesses, and we will continue to do so, also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds. If the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production, what is the government's plan to ensure Canada's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production? hon. Chair, we have worked with industry and with provinces on every front to ensure the stability of the oil and gas sector of our country. We need the workers in our oil and gas sector in order to lower emissions and achieve a greener economy. Therefore, we are looking after workers and we are looking out for companies that hold onto those jobs for those workers. Chair, the government's assistance package for the Canadian oil and gas industry provides some hope to the industry. Can the minister clarify? On a medium-sized energy company's eligibility, if the company is in default to financial institutions, does it still qualify for the business credit availability program? hon. We have the impacts of COVID and the effects of a global price war, and we have been tackling both of these on each front. As well, through the BCAP, we are making sure that more companies are eligible so that they can remain whole and so they can hold onto the jobs that we need. As we all know, we're being told we need a vaccine, and the quest for a vaccine is all-consuming globally. However, people who think about this issue and the question of the power structure and profit motive, particularly Dr. Can we ensure that public dollars for finding a vaccine will result in a product that is shared globally, openly, and is not for profit? hon. We have an open science model, and we're working with different partners and different jurisdictions to help develop vaccines and look at countermeasures and other therapeutics. Our goal is to make sure that we do so in a collaborative fashion, because this is a global pandemic, but make no mistake: If it's Canadian ingenuity and Canadian IP that's driving it, we want to support them as well. elizabeth may: As a follow-up to the minister's comment, I note it was interesting to see the claim made by this public health institute at Dalhousie about the wonderful research that was being done in Winnipeg on an Ebola vaccine. Because of the for-profit motive and the interests that big pharma had in seeing their market before they developed the product, it is alleged that the Ebola vaccine was actually delayed by the for-profit model. I wonder if we might consider examining this profit motive around the development of life-saving vaccines and other drugs. I'm working very closely with Minister Hajdu and the chief science advisor to look at all options. We are engaging with them and empowering them, and we will continue to share details of this with the public. elizabeth may: Changing gears, we know that the new regulations limiting what are described as military-style assault rifles and guns have been very controversial. It's very clear to me as an opposition member why we haven't seen legislation on any fast track. Wouldn't it be wise to table for first reading the entire legislative framework so that we know what we're talking about in the long term with regard to the buyback program and other aspects of this issue? hon. I want to assure her that at the first opportunity, we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in Canada, including legislation to deal with a buyback program, which we've indicated we will put in place. There are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation. The pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep Canadians safe, and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity. Some that are being run by not-for-profit societies are actually running very well, certainly in my community, but they are facing increased costs that could bankrupt them. As yet, there's no program to help a well-run seniors home that is not experiencing a loss of revenue and has lots of staff working hard. patty hajdu: I offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe. The member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes, but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things, including costs. We continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through, for example, generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate. To the Minister of Health, is her government prepared to take strong action to address this crisis in seniors health care? hon. Chair, the member has illustrated some of the horror stories that have appalled us all as Canadians and certainly as parliamentarians. We know that seniors deserve to live in dignity and safety with the utmost care, and that just hasn't been happening in this time of COVID and certainly, in some cases, in previous times as well. As the member knows, I've said publicly that I believe we need to hold long-term care homes to stronger standards. I am working with many ministers across our government to think about how we do that, how we the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country, social services would seize them. Over 80% of the deaths in Canada from COVID-19 have occurred in long-term care homes. Canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries, including France, Germany, Denmark and Ireland. Chair, the member opposite knows that long-term care homes have rested largely in the jurisdiction of provincial governments and, in fact, municipal governments, which often run them and fund them partially as well. That's why it's important that we have those conversations with our provincial and territorial partners, but the member can rest assured that it is on the top of my priority list to engage with my colleagues all across the country, including many experts who have studied this issue multiple times, to come up with stronger standards so all seniors have quality of life, safety and dignity in their elder years. Chair, Canadians don't want politicians pointing fingers at each other; they want our seniors taken care of. Not a single province or territory in Canada is meeting the minimum standards of hands-on care for seniors, and death rates from COVID-19 in private, for-profit facilities are two to three times that of public or non-profit homes. Will the minister agree with New Democrats that we need strong national standards, federal funding tied to enforcement and public delivery of care to effectively improve care for seniors? hon. As a matter of fact, what I hear from my colleagues at the provincial and territorial level is the willingness to collaborate on how, first of all, we get through this crisis together and strengthen safety for seniors in homes right now and then how we look to the future to build a stronger network of long-term care or care alternatives that will ensure that seniors have the right and the ability to live with dignity and safety in their homes. Chair, what I'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take, but let me move to another subject. Like long-term care, COVID-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system. Millions of Canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs, revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status. Will this government finally move to ensure all Canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity? hon. Chair, as you know, in the mandate that the Prime Minister gave to me, working on a national pharmacare plan is still there. I know it feels like a lifetime ago, but the member has very aptly illustrated why affordable medication is so important as part of a robust health care system. A few weeks ago, the Prime Minister made a big announcement expressing his desire to launch an economic recovery plan that fast-tracks the transition to a green economy. MinisterGuilbeault, MinisterMcKenna and MinisterWilkinson were appointed to a group tasked with doing just that. Today, I worry that the group is nothing but an empty shell, a convenient post-crisis political pitch. Perhaps there is an environmental component, but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around yesterday's announcement by Export and Development Canada. That's $500million for a pipeline project that will eventually produce 8.6million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually. How does the government reconcile that with its desire to transition to a green economy? the chair: The honourable minister has the floor. Certainly at this time, Canadians are most particularly focused on ensuring that support is provided so that they can put food on the table and pay their rent. Certainly as we move forward, we need to be thinking about the kind of society and economy that we want to create for the future. In that context, we need to learn lessons coming out of this experience, and certainly we need to ensure that we are addressing challenges that are on the horizon, including the challenge of climate change. Those are conversations that will need to be had as we move beyond this phase of the crisis, but at the current time, the focus is clearly on combatting the virus. monique pauz (repentigny, bq): There was absolutely no interpretation while the minister was speaking. the chair: Since so many are having issues with the interpretation, let's take a quick break while I try to fix the problem on my end. I'm going to ask the minister to repeat his answer, and we'll see whether the interpretation comes through this time. If not, please let me know, Ms.Pauz and anyone else who doesn't hear it. That means not just climate change, but also other challenges that we saw during the coronavirus crisis, challenges we need to take into account. Of course, we need to think about the future, but I want Canadians the chair: Mr.Simard has the floor. I want to tell you that, of all industries, the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry. Unfortunately, in Canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries, including providing liquidity support. Yesterday's announcement suggests that the $500million being provided by EDC is for a single project: Coastal GasLink. In 2017, under the softwood lumber action plan, EDC's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $500million. Now, EDC is shelling out $500million for just one project, Coastal GasLink, even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $500million when it needed EDC's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs. The industry accounts for 58,000jobs in Quebec and $6billion of Quebec's GDP. Does he think this situation is fair? Will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector? hon. Building on our work today, we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates, diversifies and grows. Over these past two and a half months, I have spent an inordinate amount of time with CEOs, with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast. A few days ago, I convened a meeting of CEOs from all parts of this country, from Quebec to British Columbia, to talk to them about solutions, about answers. We will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the COVID crisis, so we make sure that the chair: The next question will go to Mr. I'm hearing from small business owners like Joel, who runs a fitness club here in Pitt MeadowsMaple Ridge, and is very concerned that their landlords refuse to participate in the rent assistance program. These businesses have seen revenue drops between 50% and 100% and are asking for just 25% off their rent. When will the government help small businesses whose landlords refuse to be team players during this pandemic? hon. That's why we've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance. It allows for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75% of the rent. A number of my constituents, including Kathy, who owns a beauty salon, are concerned about meeting the PPE requirements. What is the federal government doing to ensure businesses in my riding can get access to the PPE they need to keep their employees and customers safe when they reopen? hon. However, we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with PPE. Chair, Craig and Matt are co-owners of Wanstalls, a firearms retail outlet in downtown Maple Ridge that employs eight people and serves thousands of law-abiding firearm owners in my riding, people who are now made to feel like criminals by the Liberal government. Further, they are now stuck with tens of thousands of dollars of inventory that they can no longer sell. What are they supposed to do to keep open in this already tumultuous COVID environment? hon. bill blair: It's important to understand that none of the restrictions that we have put in place, the new prohibitions, in any way impact weapons that are used for the lawful purposes in Canada of hunting and sport shooting, so those weapons remain available to Canadians engaged in those lawful activities. We have prohibited weapons that were not intended for the legal purposes of hunting and sport shooting and for which firearms are available to Canadians. Chair, according to the CERB website, if a recipient earns over $1,000 in a reporting period, their entire $2,000 benefit must be repaid. They're worried that if they take an extra shift, they will lose their CERB, but if they refuse a shift, they will also lose their CERB. Does the government intend to make them repay all their CERB if they barely go over the threshold? hon. Chair, that is why we're working with individual eligible CERB recipients to make sure they are not put in positions of undue hardship. At the beginning, the registration restricted it to basically not working, and then we relaxed the condition to earning up to $1,000. alexis brunelle-duceppe (lac-saint-jean, bq): I have a point of order, Mr.Chair. alexis brunelle-duceppe: There were some technical issues earlier during my fellow member Mario Simard's turn. The good thing is that this is all being filmed, so we can watch the video back to see what happened. alexis brunelle-duceppe: Mr.Chair, because the ministers chose to answer in French owing to a technical issue, their answers were unduly drawn out, which cost my fellow member speaking time. the chair: As I said, I'll check what happened and we'll have a solution for next time. steven guilbeault: I hope the member isn't suggesting that, because some members of the House are making an effort to speak French, they are unduly dragging out the time, as he seems to have said. Good for them, I say, for trying to speak a language they aren't necessarily comfortable in for the benefit of other members. the chair: I think a debate is brewing, but I'm sure that's not what people want, so I don't want an argument to break out over the fact that different languages are being spoken. Mr.Chair, many farmers in my riding and elsewhere are afraid they won't have enough workers this summer and fall. What is the government going to do to make sure those receiving the CERB and CESB have the right information and know about the job opportunities in the agri-food sector in our communities? the chair: The honourable minister has 15seconds to answer. Chair, I can assure the member that while we are supporting Canadians through both the CERB and the CESB, we are creating tens of thousands of jobs, including in the agriculture sector, to make sure there is labour available in this important and essential sector. When I first got elected as Speaker, one of the things I mentioned was that you would want everyone who was watching, including your families and your friends, to be proud of you. I didn't see anybody answer without one, and it is very much appreciated, not only by our fellow members but also by the people who are translating into the other language that you are not speaking<doc-sep>anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call the meeting to order.  Welcome to the third meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Pursuant to the order of reference of Monday, April20, the committee is meeting for the purposes of considering ministerial announcements, allowing members to present petitions, and questioning ministers of the crown, including the Prime Minister, in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic. I understand there's an agreement to observe a moment of silence in memory of the six members of the Canadian Armed Forces who lost their lives last Wednesday in a helicopter crash off the coast of Greece. Colleagues, we meet today to continue our discussion about how our country is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. As we do, Canadians, like everyone around the world, are doing their best to live their lives until things improve. Meanwhile, as we look towards the future, I believe that it is also important to remember our past and to continue to mark the important moments in our shared history. Andrea McCrady, is performing a special recital to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands by the Canadian Forces. In May 1945, Canadian Forces played a major role in liberating the Dutch people from Nazi occupation. May 5 is now a national holiday in the Netherlands that commemorates the event and the great friendship that now exists between our two countries. Let me remind you that, as in the House or in committee, members may not take photographs of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of our interpreters and ensure orderly meetings, I will outline a few rules. If you look at the bottom, you have a little flag that indicates whether it's English or French, and that's how we will be speaking.  I would like to remind members that petitions presented during a meeting of the special committee must already have been certified by the clerk of petitions.  In addition, to ensure that the petition is considered to have been properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for petitions certified in a previous Parliament should be emailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. It includes removing the mandatory 10-day reflection period and the number of required witnesses who will witness a person's consent. The petitioners urge the House of Commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia, and to put in place additional measures to protect vulnerable people. Petitioners call on members of the House, and hopefully the Senate as well, to support Bill S-204, which would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It would also create provisions under which a person could be made inadmissible to Canada if they had been involved in organ harvesting or trafficking. I want to remind all the members that there are specific headsets that have been mandated to all of us. If you don't have one, please talk to your IT ambassador and they will get one to you as quickly as possible. The reason for them is not so much for what you hear, but that our interpreters are working and there are work conditions that really make it difficult. Part of that is not having the appropriate boom on your headset, which will make it very difficult for them to hear and interpret for our members. The petitioners have noted that there are approximately 60 indigenous languages in Canada and that 2019, last year, was declared by the UN to be the year of indigenous languages. They draw attention to article 13 of the UNDRIP and to the TRC's calls to action numbers 13 to 16. Fundamentally, they call upon the Government of Canada to recognize indigenous languages as being official languages of Canada and to have each language recognized nationally, with implementations on regional and provincial levels, acknowledging that many regions have different languages. Chair, I am proud to present a petition on behalf of one of my constituents, Myles Lynch of St. Myles lives with cystic fibrosis and has had three lung transplants in the last five years, and he's only 22 years old. One thing Myles has been advocating for is the creation of a national opt-out program for organ donation. I am proud to have this certified today, with 1,318 signatures, asking the Standing Committee on Health to launch a study into the feasibility of the creation of a national opt-out program. I give kudos to Myles not only for his strength personally but also for his advocacy for others and for saving lives in our country by advocating for a better and an improved organ donation system. Chair, I'm very pleased to present this certified petition on behalf of several dozen residents of Toronto, Mississauga and Brampton, Ontario, who add their voices to those of the thousands upon thousands of Canadians who have signed similar petitions. Given that Canadians are living through unprecedented, catastrophic climate events, and at the same time our society, as you know, is suffering from worsening social and economic inequalitieshalf of Canadian families are only $200 away from insolvency in any given monthand particularly given the pandemic that we are currently experiencing, these petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to support motion M-1, a made-in-Canada green new deal that I am presenting in front of the House of Commons. It calls on Canada to take bold and rapid action to tackle the climate emergency, and to put in place a shift to a clean and renewable energy economy. Chair, it's an honour to table a petition on behalf of constituents from CourtenayAlberni. Over 12,000 Canadians have died over the last four years due to fentanyl-poisoned sources. They cite that the current war on drugs has been costly and grossly ineffective; that it has resulted in widespread stigma towards addiction and against those who use illicit drugs; and that criminalization of particular substances has resulted in the establishment of a drug trade that now trafficks dangerous and lethal products such as fentanyl. They are citing that regulating to ensure safe sources, with proper measures and bylaws, will reduce the criminal element associated with street drugs. They are calling on the Government of Canada to declare the current opioid overdose and fenanyl poisoning crisis a national public health emergency under the Emergencies Act. They are calling for the government to reform current drug policy to decriminalize personal possession, as has been done in Portugal and other countries, and to create with urgency and immediacy a system to provide safe and unadulterated access to substances so that people who use substances experimentally, recreationally or chronically are not at imminent risk of overdose due to a contaminated source. Chair, I'm presenting a petition today that contains the concerns of Canadians in my riding with the government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petition highlights that the Liberal government's December 5, 2019, Speech from the Throne contains numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation; that the term military-style assault rifles is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law; that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions; that the experts, including chiefs of police, agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety; that the majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States; and that the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal gun traffickers responsible for violence in our communities. The petitioners in MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed, RCMP-vetted Canadians; and to focus our limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, on reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, on mental health and on providing the Canada Border Services Agency with the tools they need to do their job effectively. I would like to remind honourable members that no member shall be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. I want to again remind honourable members to use the boom on the official headsets so that everything runs smoothly, not only for ourselves but also for the interpreters. pierre paul-hus (charlesbourghaute-saint-charles, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Although we are right in the middle of a pandemic and the government has agreed to set aside all parliamentary business in order to concentrate solely on eliminating the virus in Canada and its impacts, the Prime Minister is deceiving Canadians by introducing measures to punish law-abiding firearm owners. justin trudeau (prime minister): Mr.Chair, I feel that all Canadians were affected by the massacre in Nova Scotia. During the last election campaign, we promised to ban military-style assault weapons, and that is exactly what we have done. It is a shame that, once more, the Conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country. However, I would like to know whether he considers that, with this order in council, organized crime, street gangs and other criminals are simply going to turn in their weapons. We are doing other things to eliminate or restrict handguns in our municipalities, to strengthen the control at our borders, and to implement other measures. member speak of those measures, because we are going to work together in the House to strengthen gun control. I hope that the Conservative Party will be part of that discussion in a positive way, in order to keep Canadians safe. pierre paul-hus: Mr.Chair, I can simply say to the Prime Minister that the Conservative Party has always been committed to battling criminals, not law-abiding citizens. Speaking of criminals, we know that, even before the pandemic, the Prime Minister had asked the Parole Board of Canada to release prisoners more easily and more quickly. The Minister of Public Safety told us that the people were approaching the end of their sentences or were older, but we are learning in the media that some dangerous criminals are being released. justin trudeau: The protection, the safety and the health of all Canadians are important for the government. This is why we have taken additional measures in our correctional services to ensure that guards and inmates are protected. We have indeed opened the doors to some more speedy releases, but only in very specific cases that present little or no danger for Canadians. pierre paul-hus: So is the Prime Minister confirming to us that no dangerous criminals have been precipitously released so that they do not have to experience COVID-19 within the walls? right hon. justin trudeau: There are very strict rules and principles to ensure that people posing a threat to society are not released. Is Canada going to stand by its allies in the Five Eyes and demand that the Chinese government be completely transparent? right hon. justin trudeau: We continue to stand in solidarity with our allies, including the Five Eyes, as they have stood in solidarity with Canada in terms of the two Canadians who have been unjustly detained for a long time in China. In the coming months and years, we expect to obtain answers to all our questions about the origin of this pandemic, including questions that are important for China. At the same time, we are going to work hard to ensure that all Canadians have the equipment and the protection they need to get through this pandemic. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. For some days, discussions have been going on between people from the Bloc Qubcois and people from the government with a view to collaboratively coming up with a proposal for seniors in Quebec and Canada. The gist of our proposal is to temporarily increase the old age security by about $25per week, or $110per month. The discussion has been going on for some time and it's a proposal that we made in the election campaign. Given that impatience, I realized I should not be the one answering them, it should be the Prime Minister. So here is my question for the Prime Minister: what are you doing to seek a solution that will increase the purchasing power of seniors in Quebec and Canada in the very short term? right hon. justin trudeau: Clearly, seniors need support and significant services from us because of COVID-19. Our priority was to implement income replacement benefits for workers who have lost their jobs because of COVID-19. The most vulnerable seniors are going to receive reimbursement of the GST, which will help them very quickly. We have also channelled $9million through the United Way, to help the most vulnerable seniors. I am very pleased that we have been able to work with other parliamentarians, including those in the Bloc Qubcois, to hear these concerns and to find the best way to help seniors in the short term. In terms of the pandemic, they have concerns about their physical security, but also about their financial security. yves-franois blanchet: In the last few hours, the Prime Minister has indicated that he could need the cooperation of other parties, including the Bloc Qubcois, on a completely different matter. We are very open to that discussion, but we want the same openness when we are asking for something to serve the people of Quebec. Seniors in my constituency, as in any other of the 338constituencies, are asking what we are doing. When will there be something for them? I want to be able to give them an answer of some kind. justin trudeau: There will be announcements in the coming days on the way in which we will be able to help seniors, particularly the most vulnerable seniors. There are horror stories, whether about the CHSLDs, or about our most vulnerable seniors across the country. There are seniors who are alone, seniors who are afraid of falling ill without ever seeing their grandchildren or their children again. We have to be there for those who belong to that great generation that fought for us during the second world war. Chair, every day I hear from people who are struggling to pay their bills and to keep a roof over their head. Instead of making sure that Canadians get the help they need, the government has created complicated programs that are still letting people fall through the cracks. If the Prime Minister won't commit to a universal benefit, will he at least commit to removing the restrictive eligibility criteria that are leaving the most vulnerable people behind? right hon. Chair, we knew, when this pandemic hit, that we needed to help Canadians who were suffering from coast to coast to coast, particularly the most vulnerable. That is why we moved forward rapidly with the Canada emergency response benefit, which has helped over seven million individual Canadians and has made a huge difference. We had to move very quickly to get this money out to people, and that is exactly what we did. That is why since that moment, we have continually worked on reaching out to the most vulnerable and supporting them as well. However, because she didn't make $5,000 last year, when the pandemic hit she didn't qualify for any benefits. Chair, our focus throughout this crisis has been on helping the most vulnerable with targeted measures that will lift Canadians out of poverty and will support them. Over the past five years, we've lifted over a million people out of poverty in this country, and we've continued to put the most vulnerable at the heart of everything we're doing. At the same time, we will continue to look for more ways to help even more than the seven million Canadians who successfully receive the CERB. We recognize there's more to do, and we will continue trying to do everything we can in this unprecedented situation. Chair, the government is weirdly committed to eligibility criteria that result in regular people not getting the support they need, but not so committed to criteria for corporations and billionaires who get our help. If a company is cheating the public, using offshore tax havens not to pay its fair share, it should not be eligible for government bailouts or benefits. Other countries, like Poland, Denmark and France, have made this commitment, and if they can do it, so can we. Will he commit now that if a company has money in offshore tax havens, it will not receive public funds? right hon. Chair, the measures we've put forward are focused on helping workers who lose their jobs, regardless of the companies they work for. It is a shame to hear the NDP, which used to be the party of workers, choosing to judge workers by which multinational they work for. We have moved forward with a wage subsidy such that the employers are obliged to pass every single penny on to the workers. That is help for the workers, and that has been our focus all the way through: ordinary Canadians who need support because they are unable to work because of COVID-19. I want to remind honourable members that we're trying to stay within committee rules, which state that the length of a question and the length of an answer should be approximately the same amount of time. She has about 45 seconds left, and hopefully that's about half and half for the question and the answer. My community was facing a crisis long before the pandemic hit, and now people who are living on the streets or in parks don't have the luxury of following public health advice and just staying home. In Victoria, the province and the municipality have stepped up with solutions to house people, at least for the short term, in local hotels. Will the federal government respond to this immediate crisis and provide the needed investments in long-term, stable housing? the chair: The right honourable Prime Minister, in 25 seconds or less, please. Working with partners, we have reduced poverty by over a million people in this country, but there is more to do. We recognize that during this pandemic there's even more to do for vulnerable Canadians, and we are partnering with orders of government to make sure that happens. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): A point of order, Mr.Chair. Could we please check so that I can hear in French what the Prime Minister is saying? the chair: Okay. I'm speaking English right now and I'm on the English toggle at the bottom of the screen. It does create a bit of a disjoint when we're speaking, but it's the way to get around that so we have interpretation that works for everyone. Chair, as this is our first opportunity to meet in any forum, I want to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families of the brave men and women who lost their lives in the helicopter crash. I know that I speak for all parliamentarians when I extend our sympathy to their families and loved ones. Chair, I want to raise with the Prime Minister an issue that I've raised several times before, and that is a gap in the wage subsidy program. Those companies separately would qualify for the wage subsidy, but because of rules that the government designed, together they do not. Even though collectively they have experienced a massive drop in revenue and would otherwise be eligible, so far they've been unable to get confirmation that they will be able to access the program. Will the Prime Minister be able to deliver some good news to people who work for Brandt Tractor all across the country? right hon. justin trudeau: I thank the honourable member for his question and for his advocacy for his community and businesses in his riding. As I told him when we spoke directly, Finance officials have been directly in contact with the company in his riding. We recognize that there are particular elements in regard to this company that are challenging around application for the wage subsidy, but I know that Finance officials are working very hard to try to make sure that everyone who needs the subsidy gets it, so that the workers in his community can get the support they need. andrew scheer: The Prime Minister knows that there are many companies across the country that fall into this category as well, so we're hoping for some good news. Just flagging the time and date, it is well into May now and important decisions have to be made in very short order. There are other aspects of the government's plans to help get people through this crisis that are also causing people to fall through the cracks. As provinces start to open up, many companies are going to be faced with a very difficult decision of operating at perhaps 35% or 45% of regular revenues. They will not be able to access these programs and, in many cases, there is going to be a disincentive to reopen and put people back to work. Will the Prime Minister amend these programs to provide for more flexibility so that more and more Canadians can start to return to work in the weeks ahead? right hon. Chair, we are in an unprecedented crisis and we had to move quickly to support workers and to support families across the country, and that's exactly what we did. We're going to continue to work to try to respond to the reality that people and businesses are facing right across the country. I am eager to be faced with the challenge of how to ease off in these measures so that people can get back to work. We are still focused very much on giving the supports to workers and families that are so necessary in this time of crisis. As different provinces move forward towards reopening, as we look at different paths forward, I know that I will be able to count on all members in the House and, indeed, on Canadians from coast to coast to coast to figure out together what the best way will be to move forward on keeping us safe and restoring economic activity in the right way. the chair: We have about a minute left for maybe a 30-second question and a 30-second answer. The problems with them have been flagged for the government for weeks as well, but we're also going to see an additional challenge, where people who are receiving the emergency response benefit, who may have the option to go back to work and work some hours, are faced with a hard cap of $1,000 a month before they lose the CERB. Conservatives are proposing a progressive system, a more flexible system, where people will be able to earn more without losing their benefits as businesses ramp up but before normal working hours are restored. Again, will the Prime Minister build in some flexibility to lift the restrictive ceiling on what people can earn before losing benefits so that it always pays more to work? the chair: I believe the timer is telling all of us that the time is up, but I'll give the right honourable Prime Minister about 30 seconds to answer that, please. Our priority was getting support for Canadians right across the country with the CERB, with the wage subsidy and with other measures for students, for seniors, for farmers and for agricultural producers. We are going to work with communities and with industry as we look to reopen, to make sure that people have opportunities to work and are not penalized for it. However, our overarching priority was allowing Canadians to be confident in their ability to stay home, care for their loved ones, buy groceries and pay their rent so that we could keep safe during this pandemic. We've heard the Prime Minister admit that fixed incomes for some of them are down, rent is increasing and the price of groceries is increasing. Chair, after a lifetime of hard work, of course Canadians deserve peace of mind when it comes to their retirement security. Happily, their pensions and their benefits are still flowing, unlike for so many of those who have lost their jobs, but it's still tough. People received a GST credit, a supplementary payment that was $400 on average for single seniors and $600 for couples. I think you had reminded us as members that the amount of time for the answer should be similar to the amount of time for the question. the chair: I want to remind all honourable members to keep their answers as well as their questions as concise as possible. We see a number of inconsistencies in what is considered essential travel with regard to the U.S. While we have Americans coming over to buy cheaper prescription medications and to fish, individuals in my riding who are trying to get auditors over so that they can be approved for export businesses are being declined. We have people who have purchased masts from Canadian producers for their boats, and who want to come and pick them up, who are not being allowed to do that. When will they clarify the rules to the CBSA agents so that essential travel and trade and commerce, including individual commerce, is understood? hon. Chair, we have implemented very rigorous rules that have been well documented and understood by CBSA to stop all non-essential travel. At the same time, we recognize the importance of maintaining essential supply routes so that goods and services could reach Canada and we could put groceries on our shelves. The work we are doing to stop non-essential travel has been important for the health and safety of Canadians, and we will continue with that work. We see that many of them are not eligible for any of the benefit packages that have been rolled outEI, CERB, the wage subsidy, etc. What is the government going to do to address sole proprietors who are currently falling through the cracks? hon. Chair, first, let me say that we absolutely recognize there are businesses across the country of all sizes that are finding this to be extremely difficult. The intent of the measures we put forward is obviously not only to give individuals a bridge but to give businesses a bridge. We are looking at ways that we can ensure that the Canada emergency business account has the broadest possible application. We are looking at ways we can consider that eligibility process, recognizing that we need to make sure that the program continues to have its desired impact, and we will have more to say on that. Since then the minister has overruled the will of harvesters in Prince Edward Island and in the gulf who voted to start their seasons on time, but she has allowed harvesters from her own riding to proceed with their seasons as scheduled, giving them access to markets weeks before their competitors. This double standard is severely unfair and Atlantic harvesters are furious, as demonstrated during the protests on the Canso Causeway yesterday. When will the minister stop abusing her position and start respecting fish harvesters by opening up lobster fishing areas 23, 24 and 26? hon. Chair, when making decisions with regard to when seasons open, a number of factors are taken into account. They are complex decisions that take into account what is necessary for processors to be ready for the season, what is necessary for harvesters to be ready for the season, as well socio-economic impacts on the area. In the decisions we've made around the gulf, one of the main things we heard from all of those areas is that it was very important for them to start on the same date. Maybe I'll start muting if it's necessary, but interrupting is not going to solve anything. West coast fishing tourism is a key economic driver in British Columbia, especially in coastal communities, and yet the public fishery gets no respect from the government. A year later, the fisheries minister refuses even to discuss viable, science-based solutions to conserve B.C.'s public fisheries. Does the minister and her government have a will and a plan to support Canada's west coast fisheries and the communities they sustain? the chair: The hon. That's why we continue to work with those communities and with the fisheries to make sure that we're doing everything we possibly can to support them. During these extremely difficult times, we're working on measures with the fishery in B.C., as well as on the Atlantic coast and eastern Quebec, to make sure that we're delivering for them and that all of the issues they're having are being addressed. Chair, Canada's seniors, especially those on basic incomes, are being hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis as they face new rising costs and scarcity of services. Seniors require adequate caregiver supports, physical safety and freedom to access their savings to reinforce their financial security. Why has the government failed to recognize the increasing challenges that seniors are facing? Will the government support Canada's senior citizens? the chair: The hon. We have provided a GST credit supplement of $400 for single seniors and $600 for couples, for low- and modest-income seniors. We have also ensured that the Canada emergency response benefit is there for seniors who have lost income due to COVID-19. On April 23, my colleagues and I called on the government to create a program that would match students seeking employment with employers in Canada's essential food supply chains. What has the government done to match students and other Canadians seeking employment with employers in the agriculture and agri-food sectors, including those in the fish and seafood sector? hon. Chair, we're doing all we can to make sure, using our existing employment programs, that we create opportunities for students to work and get work experience this summer. We know that this is going to be really tough, especially in areas like agriculture, so we have dedicated streams for agriculture sector employers to access students with help from the government, and a number of different initiatives including Canada summer jobs, which I'm really excited to see the results of in the coming days. Arnold, it's the second time that I note you've threatened to cut off a Conservative microphone. I'm just wondering, given that this isn't the House of Commons and it's structured as a committee, what standing order would give you the right to cut off a member of Parliament using a mute button. It seems a little dictatorial, and I was just wondering whether you could clarify that, based on the Standing Orders. the chair: I don't think I threatened to use mute, but thank you for bringing that up. I am trying to keep the rules where the questions and the answers are equal, so that there are no interruptions on either side. Bring the papers with the actual verbiage on it where I threatened, and we'll go over it, but I don't think this is the venue to do that. rachael harder (lethbridge, cpc): Canadians have outrightly expressed outrage and disappointment with the government's initiative to put a gun ban in place. Does the minister stand by his comment that these changes would have prevented the tragedy in Nova Scotia? the chair: The honourable minister in 15 seconds or less, please. bill blair: We have heard from health professionals, women's rights organizations, victims groups and the police and our unions. They're all very supportive of the government's measure to ban weapons that have no place in a civil society and were designed to kill people. rachael harder: It's interesting that the minister is misleading Canadians in that comment because the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has actually said that a gun ban will do nothing of the sort, that it actually will not protect Canadians. How many criminals will see guns seized because of the changes that have been implemented by the Liberal government? hon. The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed assault rifles. The chief in Toronto said that taking those assault rifles off the streets contributes to public safety, and the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs has declared that military assault rifles are produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and they urged successive governments to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles. Absolutely no criminals will see their guns seized based on the Liberals' legislation that's coming forward because it actually goes after those who legally own and use their firearms. Can the Prime Minister please tell us why he decided to go after law-abiding citizens instead of actually going after criminals who have gotten their firearms in an illegal manner and then used them to commit crimes? the chair: The honourable minister in 25 seconds or less, please. bill blair: Yes, to be very clear, the order in council actually is targeted at weapons, weapons that were designed for military use, and in their design and in their intent, to kill people, they've actually been used in this country, at cole Polytechnique; in Moncton; at a Quebec City mosque; in Fredericton; at Mayerthorpe and most recently in Nova Scotia. They are being used and have been used in Canada and around the world to commit mass murder, and in the interest of public safety and at the urging the chair: We'll go on to Ms. Now I understand the Prime Minister has his food prepared for him at 24 Sussex Drive and then it's delivered to him at the cottage where he lives. Now, they're in a crisis right now, which means that regular Canadians are actually at risk of not having food available for them at the grocery stores where they purchase theirs. Why doesn't the Prime Minister care about the women and the men who work incredibly hard to keep Canada fed? hon. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr. member that our government cares very, very much about the women and men who work so hard to feed our country. Let me just say I am grateful to all the farmers, like my dad, who are out in their fields right now getting ready for seeding. We, as Canadians, are lucky to be citizens of an agricultural superpower, and our government believes in supporting our farmers and ranchers. rachael harder: I'm confused as to why the Prime Minister didn't take my question, and at a bare minimum as to why the agriculture minister doesn't feel it's important enough for her to be a part of this discussion today. When we have farmers who produce for Canadians on a daily basis and they're asking some serious and some very important questions, and we don't even have a minister who's willing to come to the table and engage in this conversation, that's shameful. Several meat-packing plants have been forced to shut down because of COVID-19 and, as a result, farmers are forced to hold stock longer than expected. Cattle producers in my region are spending more than $60,000 a day to keep their livestock fed while they wait for processing plants to reopen. When will the government take this seriously and at least implement a set-aside program for those who are beef producers in Canada? hon. Chair, let me just say that I feel there is nothing shameful at all in having me, the Deputy Prime Minister, answer questions about agriculture. I am actually very proud to speak up for Canada's amazing farmers, for our country's amazing ranchers, for our amazing pork producers and our poultry producers. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): Thank you, Mr. I too would like to express my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the six military heroes who lost their lives at sea last week. I'm sure that all members of the House stand shoulder to shoulder with the families, with the crew of the HMCS Fredericton and, indeed, with the entire Canadian Armed Forces community during this time of grief. Can the Minister of National Defence give us an update as to the Cyclone helicopter crash off the coast of Greece last week? hon. Our number one priority is to make sure that we look after them, and that's exactly what we are doing. I actually spoke with the Italian minister of defence and he promised full support for this investigation and any support that's required. the chair: I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut you off there, if we're going by the rules that were pointed out by the House. I know that back in early January, military intelligence through CF Intelligence Command was reporting, through the chain of command, the novel coronavirus and the outbreak in Wuhan. On what date was he, as Minister of National Defence, given his first intelligence briefing on the outbreak and the pandemic in China? hon. We work with our Five Eyes intelligence sources and this has been a whole-of-government effort, right from the beginning. Obviously, I can't discuss the intelligence in this forum, but I can assure you that our response has been well informed with the correct information. james bezan: Minister Sajjan, we know that intelligence was going up the chain of command in National Defence. It was reported in the media that in early January the hierarchy within the Canadian Armed Forces was being made aware of the coronavirus outbreak. As with all our intelligence, we work together from a whole-of-government perspective with all of our intelligence agencies. One thing I can assure you is that our response has been well informed with all the correct information that is provided to me and other members of cabinet. james bezan: What was that timeline? From the time you were first told, Minister Sajjan, about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, what did you do with that intelligence? When did you give it to the Prime Minister or to Minister Hajdu as the Minister of Health? hon. Chair, let me say that our government's response to this global pandemic has of course been informed by the excellent work of Canadian intelligence agencies throughout. In January, the Prime Minister convened a meeting of the incident response group, and in January we increased screening at all major airports. All of these actions were informed by the work of our excellent intelligence community, and of course our work with our Five Eyes, NATO and NORAD allies. james bezan: I want to come back the chair: We now move to Mr.Ste-Marie. gabriel ste-marie (joliette, bq): Can I go ahead, Mr.Chair? the chair: Yes, go ahead. In an interview with Grald Fillion, tax expert Andr Lareau, who specializes in tax havens, pointed out that $350billion Canadian is parked in just 12tax havens. Mr.Lareau also notes that the government is aware that all of this Canadian money is stashed in tax havens but is doing nothing about it. He said that it's time for Canada to tackle the problem given that it has a $250-billion deficit, and that if it doesn't act now to change things, it never will. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): Mr.Chair, as soon as we took office, in 2015, our government made cracking down on tax evaders in Canada and abroad a priority. I realize that my fellow member is impatient, but he has to understand that this is a very complex issue. Under our leadership, in three years, the Canada Revenue Agency has undertaken twice as many audits related to offshore tax evasion as it did in the 10years the Conservatives were in power. As we speak, the agency is conducting more than 50criminal investigations tied to international tax evasion. gabriel ste-marie: You're right, I am very impatient, because whenever I bring up the fact that companies are using tax havens legally, the minister misses the point and tells me that she is going after fraudsters. Since Parliament began sitting virtually, it's been mentioned a few times that Denmark and Poland have decided to deal with the issue. Even France's finance minister, Bruno LeMaire, said that companies with subsidiaries in tax havens would not be eligible for public assistance. We hear thePrime Minister and other government officials say all the time that the wage subsidies are going to workers, so I'd like to cite another examplebanks. The government is injecting huge amounts of cash into the financial system and repurchasing troubled assets in massive quantities, and yet, the five major banks in Toronto, alone, are continuing to save billions of dollars every year by artificially redirecting their profits to tax havens. This has nothing to do with wages for workers, and everything to do with the repurchase of troubled assets, cash flow and billions of dollars that the government could be going after. Is the government going to seize this opportunity to make the corporate use of tax havens illegal? hon. diane lebouthillier: Mr.Chair, our government is taking unprecedented steps through the Canada emergency wage subsidy measure to support businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. What's more, any employer receiving the subsidy who is deemed ineligible will have to repay the full amount. Anyone who abuses the program could face a fine of up to 225% of the wage subsidy amount and up to five years in prison. the chair: Mr.Ste-Marie, you have about 30seconds to ask your question, and about the same for the answer. Although completely immoral, the use of tax havens by companies is legal under section5907 of the Income Tax Regulations. We are going to have a $250-billion deficit to pay off, and everyone is going to have to chip in, including the rich who are currently taking advantage of the system. diane lebouthillier: Mr.Chair, thanks to a historic billion-dollar investment, our government has given the agency the resources it needs to do the job, and we are starting to see results. I'm proud of how the Government of Canada has been beside Canadians through every step of this pandemic and has supported Canadians when they needed it most. In BonavistaBurinTrinity and across our country, our commercial fishery has seen many challenges and impacts. Last week, my colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, announced an investment that will ensure resilience of the food system by allowing Canada's fish and seafood processing sector to safely and efficiently process, store, package and distribute healthy, high-quality products on to the plates of Canadians. The fish harvesters in my riding are fearful of what will happen within this industry and their immediate futures. Chair, I want to thank my colleague from BonavistaBurinTrinity for keeping us well aware of what's happening in his riding with harvesters and with processors. It's the backbone and the lifeblood of our communities and that's why we want to be there to support them. We've already taken steps by making sure that the CERB is now able to be accessed by people who are seasonal workers. As well, we are making sure that people who are running out of fishers EI are also able to qualify for it. We also have made an investment of $62.5 million to support our processors to make sure they are able to be ready for the challenges that they are going to face because of COVID-19. We are working with our partners across industry to make sure we're hearing what their major concerns are. We will have more to say about that and what we will be able to do in the coming days. Chair, in my riding of SurreyNewton, I'm in close contact with businesses that represent all the chair: We have a point of order. damien kurek (battle rivercrowfoot, cpc): Sorry, but there seems to be an issue with the audio. Chair, in my riding of SurreyNewton, I'm in close contact with businesses that represent all vantage points in the supply chainfrom manufacturers to retailers, transport companies to warehousing. With provinces and territories moving at different speeds and implementing different protocols for reopening the economy, there is a lot of confusion in my local business community on the timing and logistics of how this will happen. With so many different parts of the supply chain operating in different jurisdictions, and with each business serving unique roles on this spectrum, how can the federal government serve to best coordinate with the provinces and territories so that the supply chain can be implemented smoothly as we embark on our economic recovery? hon. One of the most important things the federal government can do when it comes to the reopening of the Canadian economy is to work in close collaboration with the premiers of the provinces and territories. That's why I was so pleased that last week the Prime Minister, together with all the first ministers of the country, was able to issue a statement around the principles that will be guiding our entire country as we move towards a restart. This is so important because, as my colleague has pointed out, all of our business, our economic activity, happens across the country. We have been able to work together in fighting coronavirus, and we are going to work together in the future to keep on fighting coronavirus and to reopen Canada. In Alberta, meat-packing plants are directly responsible for nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 cases. The government and management ignored the pleas of workers and did not put effective safety protocols in place to deal with COVID-19. Now, two workers are dead, at least six more are in intensive care and COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire through these communities. On March 27, regarding the CERB, the Minister of Finance said that if workers don't feel comfortable in their work, if they decide to stay home, they can apply for the benefit, yet the website says differently. Will the minister guarantee that every Canadian receiving CERB, EI or the CESB will not lose their benefits if they refuse to return to work or to accept work that is unsafe due to COVID-19? hon. chrystia freeland: Let me thank the member, first of all, for her really very important question. I think all of us share the concern for Canada's essential workers who are keeping us safe, putting food on our tables and often working in difficult conditions. When it comes to the Cargill plant, this is an issue that our government has been very closely engaged in. My colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has spoken with her provincial counterpart and the head of the plant. To the question my colleague asked about workers, it is absolutely the case that no Canadian should feel they need to work in an environment that is unsafe, and it is also very much the case that any Canadian who is feeling unwell should stay at home. This is the way that collectively we take care of ourselves and we take care the chair: We will go on to Ms. heather mcpherson: I just want to be clear, because I'm not a hundred per cent sure that I got an answer in that response, so I'll try one more time. Knowing that workers have a fundamental right to refuse unsafe work, can the minister confirm one hundred per cent that if workers refuse unsafe work, they will be able to access the CERB, or was the Minister of Finance incorrect when he spoke on March 27? the chair: The honourable minister. chrystia freeland: In a time of coronavirus that is even more the case, and the government of course should not penalize workers for doing the right thing and declining to go to work in unsafe conditions. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair to avoid back and forth, just to try to keep some order in the meeting. If the provincial government won't shut down the plant, will the federal government shut down unsafe plants through the Canadian Food Inspection Agency? hon. Chair, on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, let me be very clear that my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has been in touch with provincial authorities. The duties of the food inspection agency, of course, are to ensure that the food produced at the plant is safe. We are working closely with provincial authorities and with health authorities to ensure that the chair: We will go back to Ms. Can the finance minister please let us know if Cargill, a company that is owned by billionaires, with business in Luxembourg, a known tax haven, has received any federal funding this year for COVID-related support? hon. diane lebouthillier: This is a tough time for Canadians, and our government is doing everything it can to support them. More than 7million Canadians have applied for the Canada emergency response benefit, which the Canada Revenue Agency and Service Canada administer. I want to say how proud I am of the work the agency is doing; staff worked tirelessly to get the program up and running in record time. richard bragdon (tobiquemactaquac, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Potato farmers in New Brunswick and across Canada are sitting on massive stores of potatoes that were destined for the restaurant industry, but due to the pandemic, they now have no customers. What is the Prime Minister's plan for the helping farmers offload these potatoes so that they are ready for the 2020 season? hon. We are aware that the coronavirus, by keeping us away from restaurants where we eat french fries, has had a profound effect on the market for potatoes. The program announced today by the Prime Minister and my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, will be very helpful for potato farmers, including with the surplus food program that starts with a $50 million fund, and that the chair: We'll go back to Mr. With an estimated $300 million worth of potatoes in storage, the announced funding from the government today simply doesn't go far enough. How does the Prime Minister plan to mitigate these shortfalls and allow farmers to continue to grow the food we so desperately need? hon. The program today is $252 million, which comes on top of the broad range of other programs that farmers, of course, have access to. On potato farmers, in particular, I agree with the honourable member that this is a specific area of concern. I think all Canadians would like to see those potatoes not be wasted but be used, and that's why the $50 million for surplus food purchase is going to be so helpful. The $16-billion beef industry is expected to take a massive hit due to the closures and reduced production of the meat-packing plants. Does the government truly believe that the announced $125 million that is shared between beef, poultry and pork producers will be enough to support these multi-billion dollar industries so they can put food on the tables of Canadians? hon. Chair, I absolutely agree with the honourable member that our beef, pork and poultry producers are absolutely essential for our country. I am very pleased as a Canadian that we have security that comes from being a country that produces not only enough food for ourselves, but also enough food to feed the world. That is why the $125 million specifically to support our beef, pork and poultry producers is going to be so helpful. Chair, the government's announcement of $252 million for the agriculture sector falls well short of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture's request for immediate government relief for farmers. The president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, Mary Robinson, put it today something like this: that if the farmhouse is on fire, the government has offered the equivalent of a bucket of water. Does the government have a plan to offer more than just crumbs to keep the vital agriculture sector operating and providing the food we so desperately need? When will the government finally make those who literally keep our land and grow our food a priority in this time of crisis? hon. Chair, I don't know about the honourable member, but where I come from, $252 million is not just crumbs. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight two other aspects of the essential support for farmers that we announced today: the $77 million to support food processors, which will not only be important for the processors, but helpful for the farmers who produce products that go to them; and the $250 million that we would like to add to the Canadian Dairy Commission's line of credit to raise it to half a billion dollars, which will be very helpful to our essential dairy farmers. Chair, a couple in my riding has had to shut down their business, and they are on CERB. They were shocked when their 16-year-old son also qualified, and he is receiving $8,000 on the basis of part-time work throughout the school year. Why is the government handing out a windfall to teenagers who are living at home while denying university students and ignoring seniors on fixed incomes? hon. Chair, any individual who has lost work for COVID reasons is eligible for the CERB, regardless of their personal circumstances. If you made $5,000 in the past year and are a resident of Canada, you qualify for the CERB. This is not a matter of differentiating between the personal circumstances of individuals but of acknowledging that many workers in different situations have lost their work or have had their work significantly reduced because of COVID. cathay wagantall: Clearly, high school students would not have the same needs as university students and our seniors who are suffering at this time. The government's own findings on banning handguns and assault firearms state, In all cases the data does not conclusively demonstrate that these handgun or assault weapon bans have led to reductions in gun violence. Why is the Prime Minister so bent on penalizing law-abiding firearms owners when he should be focusing on funding our CBSA officers first, giving them the resources they need to seize smuggled firearms at our borders? hon. Chair, I note with some interest that when we brought forward legislation in a budget in the last two years to increase the number of officers at the border, the member opposite voted against it. The evidence is overwhelming that these weapons are designed to be used, and have been used, to kill innocent people. Countries that adopt sensible gun policiesplaces like New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdomhave all recognized that there's no place for these weapons in a civil society. There have been far too many people killed with these weapons, and even most recently, to honour and respect the terrible tragedy in Nova Scotia, the time to act is now, and we've acted. cathay wagantall: Last week the Minister of Agriculture said, Step by step we are giving our farmers...the tools they need to continue their...work. On April 30, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture called on the minister to create a $2.6-billion fund to maintain food security in Canada. This morning, the Prime Minister announced $252 million, hit-and-miss, across the agriculture sector. With all due respect, this is a slap in the face to our farmers and the agri-food sector. If the deputy minister is going to answer the question in her place, how does she see it is right to be providing $9 billion to students and only crumbs to our agriculture sector? hon. Chair, first of all, let me say I do not, as has now been suggested by two members opposite, consider it in any way shameful that I should be answering questions about our support for the agricultural sector. The $252 million of support is real and meaningful, and it is directed exactly where it is needed. As to the question about students, let me just point out that farm kids are students too, and farm kids will be benefiting from the support for students. Meat packing plants like Quebec-based Olymel are extremely worried that they won't be able to stay open throughout the pandemic. In the summer, these plants rely on students to do overtime and fill in for full-time employees on vacation. However, the Canada emergency student benefit makes it possible for these much-needed workers to stay home while still collecting the same amount of money. That's why the government must adjust its current summer job program for students in the agriculture and agri-food sectors. carla qualtrough: I can assure you that we are doing our best efforts to not disincentivize work. We are looking at ways we can create additional jobs through Canada summer jobs, through the the chair: There is a point of order. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, what the minister is saying is not being interpreted. carla qualtrough: Last week, as part of the measures announced around supporting our students, we announced the creation of 76,000 additional jobs, including jobs in the agriculture and processing sectors. This is exactly what we're doing through our youth employment and skills strategy, and that's what we'll continue to do. richard lehoux: I'm not sure the minister understood my question about the Canada emergency student benefit. I am very concerned about the agricultural sector, but the tourist and horticultural sectors are also on my mind. A number of business owners in my riding have reached out to me because the shortage of student workers is forcing them to shut down for the summer. Minister, what do you have to say to those business owners in the tourist and horticultural sectors whom you are not helping? hon. We've heard very clearly from the students that they want to work and want to serve in their communities in this time of crisis. That's why we're creating additional employment opportunities and an income support mechanism that allows them to work. Pork and beef producers are feeling the impact of the country's shutdown triggered by the pandemic. For the past five years, the government has been saying that the programs to help producers will be improved. When will the government make these changes, including the changes to agristability, and when can producers access them? hon. chrystia freeland: We announced over $77 million in assistance for food processors to help them protect their workers and deal with the costs associated with the coronavirus. To help livestock and pork producers, we established agrirecovery, a national initiative that will provide $125million to help producers adapt to market changes. The measures announced at noon today received a very cold reception from the entire agriculture and agri-food sector, since the sector had asked for about $2.6billion. I think that it's important to support our agri-food industry and our farms, given the significant need for sovereignty. Many Canadians in the agriculture and agri-food sector have made this clear, as I was saying earlier. chrystia freeland: Our country, Canada, will never depend on its neighbours or any other country for food. I want to mention another significant part of our announcement today, which is the $50million surplus food purchase program. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We'll now move on to the next question. blaine calkins (red deerlacombe, cpc): Madam Chair, how will the government's forced confiscation of law-abiding firearms owners' property prevent criminals from illegally acquiring firearms from the United States? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, in response to that, I would simply remind the member that we have made it very clear that these weapons have no place in civil society, so we have prohibited military-style assault weapons that have been designed to be used to kill people and have been used to kill people. We'll bring forward new authorities, new offences, new penalties to deal with people who smuggle weapons across the border. We're also bringing in new regulations for the storage of weapons to make it more difficult for people to steal these guns. To deal with people who purchase them illegally and sell them illegally, there will be new offences and penalties to make ensure that they face the consequences. blaine calkins: The government previously has said that decisions like classifying firearms should be left to experts. A legal opinion that's already been obtained says that the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun with the choke removed is in excess of 20 millimetres. That is the same firearm that Olympic trap shooters, Olympic skeet shooters, duck hunters and geese hunters all across our country use on a very regular basis. First of all, we have prohibited large-bore weapons, such as grenade launchers, but with reference to the 10-gauge shotgun and the 12-gauge shotgun, I would simply remind the member that the bore of a 10-gauge shotgun is 19.69 millimetres in width and the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun is 18.53 millimetres in width, both of them under the size for prohibition and therefore not covered in the new prohibitions that the government introduced on Friday. blaine calkins: Madam Chair, the opinion is that of one of the foremost experts we have in Canada when it comes to firearms legislation. If the entirety of the barrel length is considered, then the removal of the choke makes that barrel in excess of 20 millimetres. There is no plan for a buyback program in this policy, and law-abiding firearms owners are not able currently to surrender their firearms. Given this, and the fact that law-abiding firearms owners aren't committing any gun violence, what was the government's immediate benefit of making this announcement on May 1? hon. Along with the prohibition that we have put in place, we have also, using the order in council, established an amnesty period, but the amnesty period is non-permissive grandfathering of those weapons. They cannot be used, they can't be taken to the range for shooting, they can't be used for hunting, they can't be sold and they can't be transferred, so we have put in strong measures to ensure that these weapons will not be available for use. We have also put in an amnesty period that will allow us to bring forward the legislation and a budget in order to effect a responsible, safe and effective buyback program to remove these weapons from society. blaine calkins: Madam Chair, since January 1, 2002, any law-abiding citizen who was issued with a firearms licence by the government would have been cross-referenced with a continuous eligibility check 6,695 times up until May 1 of this year. How many times was this most recent mass murderer here in Canada checked against a criminal database since January 2002? hon. bill blair: As the member is probably aware, there is a very extensive investigation currently being conducted into that individual and how he acquired his firearms, and it's not appropriate to discuss that. However, I think what is appropriate is to recognize that the weapons that this individual had available to him are weapons that were not designed for target shooting or hunting purposes or any sporting purposes. In the hands of someone who is intent on mass murder, they represent an unacceptable and deadly risk to Canadians, and that's why we have prohibited them. I'd also remind the member that other countries that have adopted sensible gun control laws, such as New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom, have also implemented very similar bans. I'd like to start by giving my condolences for the crew from the HMCS Fredericton who died, and in particular to the family of Captain Kevin Hagen. Other countries are strongly recommending that all citizens wear masks wherever people gather indoors, including in schools, on public transit and in stores. Taiwan has effectively stopped the spread of the coronavirus by supplying people with masks and installing dispensers of hand sanitizer throughout public spaces. Taiwan started in the top 10 countries affected by COVID-19, and today it is number 119. Will Canada follow Taiwan's example so we can lift the lockdown safely and get Canadians back to work? hon. patty hajdu (minister of health): Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and I thank the member for his question. There's no doubt that masks can play a role in a layered approach to protecting Canadians' health and safety, but as the member has mentioned, there are many other aspects to ensuring that Canadians are safe no matter where they go. Social distancing can provide the most protection, in fact, when you're out in public or you're in another place where there are other people. Tam has said that when physical distancing is not an option, Canadians should consider wearing a mask. I'd like to give a shout-out to Martha and her team, who are doing a fundraiser for the SPCA by making masks for citizens in my riding. Madam Chair, many people are falling through the cracks in the pandemic relief plan, including seniors who face an increase in the cost of living and a loss of retirement investment income. Will the government make the CERB a universal benefit to ensure that all Canadians who need help get help? If not, will the government increase old age security and allow seniors to withdraw funds from their RRSP without penalties so that they can pay their bills? hon. We do recognize that OAS and GIS are very important parts of the retirement income of Canadians, particularly lower-income seniors. The CERB is there for working seniors who have lost income as a result of COVID-19. We've also reduced the mandatory retirement withdrawals by 25%, and we've also spent half a billion dollars to support organizations that assist vulnerable Canadians, including seniors the acting chair (mrs. paul manly: Many small businesses do not meet the eligibility requirements for the various relief programs on offer, particularly sole proprietorships. At the same time, we have large companies in this country that use tax havens and loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of public services. Will the government ensure that the needs of small businesses are met and withhold relief from corporations that use tax havens to avoid paying taxes in Canada? hon. mary ng (minister of small business, export promotion and international trade): I want to thank the hon. That is why we have implemented many measures to help them weather this difficult period in COVID-19. Whether it is a small business loan, a wage subsidy or commercial rent assistance, or just lowering the cost by deferring GST or HST or customs duties, many measures have been put forward to help our small businesses through this very difficult time. As we navigate this pandemic crisis, we are also in the middle of another major crisis: the climate emergency. Will this government develop its economic recovery plan for the pandemic with the climate emergency at the forefront of its planning? the acting chair (mrs. The focus of the government at the present time is on combatting the virus and on steps to start to relax some of the measures that have been taken. As we look forward, we need to learn from the experiences of this crisis as well as look forward to some of the looming crises on the horizon. Climate change is one of those, and we certainly intend to reflect on resilience for the economy as we move forward. niki ashton (churchillkeewatinook aski, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. First nations across northern Manitoba and many others across the country have been doing everything possible to keep COVID-19 out of their communities. Many here have implemented strict lockdowns or travel restrictions, but the federal government has done virtually nothing to deal with the chronic issues that have made them vulnerable in the first place, such as overcrowded housing and the lack of hospitals. What is your government doing to support communities in the face of that possibility? Why isn't the government supporting the call for a ventilation centre in Berens River, a hospital in Cross Lake, a hospital in the Island Lake region? If the government couldn't act in time for this first wave of the pandemic, can it at least act in time for a potential second wave? hon. marc miller (minister of indigenous services): Indeed, Madam Chair, one of the reflections we have in coming out of this global pandemic is that we don't want to go into the next one with the same social determinants of health that have made indigenous communities more vulnerable and more susceptible to contracting and then spreading COVID-19. A lot of the historic housing funds that we have mobilized in order to address overcrowding in particular are cold comfort to those communities that are still finding themselves in overcrowded situations. In the staged approach to the epidemic and the onset of COVID-19, there are many measures that Indigenous Services Canada and as a whole of government we will deploy, including surge capacity, increased PPE, and nurses and doctors. Obviously, we are looking for a medical solution to a medical problem, and that is what we will spare no expense or resource to address as indigenous communities continue to face the looming threat of a second wave of COVID-19 as they start to relax some of their confinement procedures. niki ashton: Again, Madam Chair, to the Minister of Indigenous Services, many of us across northern Canada are deeply concerned by the outbreak taking place in northern Saskatchewan, centred in La Loche. Your government says it's committed to doing everything it can to keep first nations safe, yet nothing has been done to support calls for pandemic shutdowns. Will you support first nations in their call for shutdowns during this pandemic to save lives now? hon. Members won't be surprised to know that that number will only increase as the days go on and as we implement aggressive testing and contact tracing. We are working with surrounding first nations and communities and with the Mtis and Dene communities in La Loche to ensure that medical precautions are being put into place and that strict social distancing is being put into effect. This is a situation that is very much evolving minute by minute, and it is something for which we have deployed additional resources, along with Meadow Lake and the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority to ensure that there is a health response to a health problem. marc miller: One of the things we see as we see the evolving dynamic and the potential spreads, particularly the fear of clusters as communities, provinces, territories may choose to relax certain measures, is the need to have a more targeted approach as to how the economy reacts and deals with it, particularly in northern and vulnerable communities. This is something for which we will need to have a serious approach, with both the Minister of Natural Resources and also our provincial counterparts, to make sure that we aren't taking hasty measures to reopen the economy while we're trying to protectand this is our most important goalindigenous communities from getting exposed and spreading COVID-19. Hundreds of fishers and their families here in Manitoba who work with the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation are desperately calling for emergency support. Many are calling on the federal government to also work with them and the FFMC to redirect their product to domestic markets and communities here at home to address the growing food insecurity people are facing. When will your government announce support for inland fishers, including here in Manitoba, and will you work to ensure that their product, healthy fish, can be provided here at home for people who need it? hon. bernadette jordan: Madam Chair, we know that COVID-19 is having extreme impacts on northern first nations communities, especially with regard to fisheries in areas that rely on it for not only their livelihoods but also for the cultural importance. Indigenous harvesters are able to access through the aboriginal financial institutions the $306 million we've put in for support for indigenous small and medium-sized businesses. The funding allows for short-term interest-free loans as well as for non-repayable contributions. We also announced earlier that the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency has made available $15 million in non-repayable support for businesses. We know that there's more that needs to be done to support our first nations communities as well as our harvesters. I don't want to talk about the $1billion that the government used to track down tax cheats. I want to ask the minister why she isn't taking this opportunity to learn from countries that are putting an end to tax avoidance in tax havens, a legal but immoral practice in this day and age. Can she explain why she isn't showing leadership by convincing cabinet to change course and eliminate the legal measure known as tax avoidance, which enables companies to avoid paying taxes and put money in tax havens? hon. diane lebouthillier: MadamChair, as soon as our government took office in 2015, we made it a priority to crack down on tax cheats. Our government's historic investments of almost $1 billion have ensured that the agency can access the necessary resources for its work. claude debellefeuille: MadamChair, does the minister realize that she's being filmed and recorded and that she isn't answering my question? I don't want to talk about cheats. I want to talk about companies that use a legal mechanism to avoid paying taxes and to put their money in tax havens. Can she tell me how many companies legally take advantage of tax avoidance in tax havens? How much money escapes taxation through this legal mechanism? The government could invest this money in its economic recovery post-COVID-19. Regarding tax evasion abroad, our leadership made it possible for the agency to conduct twice as many audits in three years as it conducted in 10 years under the Conservatives. However, I don't understand the government's lack of willingness to eliminate this mechanism, which is legal but completely immoral. The Fdration de la relve agricole du Qubec and the UPA approached the Minister of Finance two weeks ago and still haven't received a response regarding the following issue. As a result, these farms are being penalized because they aren't eligible for the $40,000 in loans available through the Canada emergency business account. To qualify for these loans, the farms needed a payroll of $20,000 to $1.5million in 2019. Does the Minister of Finance plan to respond to the farmers who want to access the $40,000 in loans? hon. The tourism ministry was one of the first and hardest-hit industries during this crisis, yet despite the Prime Minister's announcement over three weeks ago now of a plan to bring forward a tourism-specific aid package to help the businesses who employ millions of unemployed Canadians who work in tourism, there's still been nothing from this government. I had the chance to talk to many of the leaders in the sector, and clearly there's a lot of anxiety. We also had the chance to work with all the G20 ministers of tourism all together, and we know we have to act the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. Tourism-based communities like the ones in Banff and Canmore, which I represent, are tourism-based economies and have unemployment rates of 85% or higher. They also don't qualify for a lot of the programs because they're seasonal businesses and make most or all of their revenues for the year from May to October, so they're at risk of losing their entire season. Will the government consider making changes to the programs to make sure that seasonal businesses can get help? What does the government plan to do to help the tourism industry recover after the pandemic? hon. Obviously, the tourism sector has access to many measures, including the CEBA account, the $40,000 account. They will be having access also to funding through the regional development agencies, and we'll be coming up with the details soon. Of course, in my colleague's riding of Banff, which is a fantastic place and a tourism gem, they will have access to the support through WD, western economic diversification. If there are particular cases you would like to raise with me, I would be more than happy to talk to you to see how, on the ground, we can help the tourism operators. It doesn't address anything about their concerns about the hard economic recovery they'll have after the pandemic. Another industry that's very hard hit in my province and my riding is the oil and gas industry. It's another industry the Prime Minister has promised to help, but there hasn't been anything. The only so-called assistance there's been to help hurting Albertans in the oil patch has been measures to speed up the death of the industry that they work in. Will the Liberal government ever show any concern for Albertans? Will they bring forward a plan to preserve Canadian jobs? Will they put forward a plan to ensure the use of Canadian oil before oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia? hon. Chair, the federal government has taken several steps in recent weeks that will meaningfully support workers and communities that depend on this industry. We have the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which covers 75% of an employee's wages for the employer. We have more liquidity for oil and gas companies through new loans of $15 million to $60 million from the Business Development Bank of Canada. We continue to step forward in our response to the impacts of COVID-19 on my province here in Newfoundland and Labrador and on Alberta and Saskatchewan. These three provinces are being hit by two crises at the same time, a crisis of demand for oil and gas on the world markets and of course a crisis of public health with COVID-19. Chair, a lot of these things we're hearing about aren't going to actually help the industry to recover. Maybe what they could do is consider expediting the approval of billions of dollars of private sector projects that would put thousands and thousands of Canadians back to work. Will the government consider looking at ways that we can expedite projects? Will they look at ways that we can encourage the use of Canadian oil before the use of oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia? hon. We have been working with labour, concentrating on workers and concentrating on the companies that support those jobs to make sure that they remain whole and those jobs will be there for those workers. We're particularly proud of our orphan wells program, which was launched by the Alberta government in conjunction with us. I am pleased to inform this House that the uptake on applications for that program is significantly higher than even we expected<doc-sep>I've received apologies for absence from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Si\u00e2n today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb\u00a0digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas? kirsty williams am: Thank you, Dawn. So, you're\u00a0absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could\u2014? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. steve davies: In short, the new purpose is to meet the needs of particular groups of children and young people. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but I think it's really encouraging that in my discussions yesterday\u2014I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities\u2014some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently\u2014I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday. So, Monday will be a challenge for some, and not all will be delivering it, but we will be working so that we can get as much as possible delivered for those groups over the next two weeks, and particularly to have resilient programmes post Easter for the groups of children in those three categories that I said. Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. kirsty williams am: In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs. steve davies: I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place. I'm working with Albert Heaney my colleague, the director for social services, who is meeting with the 22 directors of social services today to look to ensure that we are joined up in ensuring none of these children fall through the gap. hefin david am: A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents? kirsty williams am: We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying, 'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.' So, schools are already taking the initiative and having those conversations with parents about what their needs will be. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. suzy davies am: Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services' care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need. kirsty williams am: We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children? Because that's not there normally, is it, except in separate\u2014 kirsty williams am: We do find ourselves in a strange situation. My understanding is what we're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange, 'You get this for two weeks, then you don't get it for two weeks, and then you're back in.' My understanding is, in England, that is what they're going to do. We're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It won't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks. helen mary jones am: Just briefly, building on Suzy's question, one particular group of children and young people that I hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers. For some of them, they may not be able to come into school because the people they're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions. But I think that, for other young carers, coming to school is an absolute lifeline, because they're working at home. So, I don't know if it's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities, but it's a group of young people who, again, may not be vulnerable in other ways, but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school. And the other group\u2014and this, I suppose, goes back to Suzy's point about teachers knowing their young people\u2014is the children who may be living in situations where they're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse. Again, these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services, but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be. So, again, I'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools. If a teacher is worried about what a child's circumstances are like at home, whether they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the\u2014. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. We've all got a role to play, and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission. We need to send a really clear message that you're all part of the solution, and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak. helen mary jones am: I'm sure that that's true, but I'm sure that we wouldn't be wanting a child who's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad\u2014. janet finch-saunders am: Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses. lynne neagle am: Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance. dawn bowden am: Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this\u2014and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that\u2014the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying, 'Well, what's going to happen to that?' Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff? steve davies: Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation\u2014and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear\u2014is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing. dawn bowden am: So, would you anticipate\u2014again, I know this is all a bit 'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable\u2014that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the context of teaching staff, teaching assistants, but we're also having discussions with local authorities, and I met with the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services this week, to look at deploying youth workers, to look to be deploying other staff that the local authority may employ, like sports development officers. Welsh Government will be talking with a range of our partners who perhaps their normal activities can't continue at the moment, but actually have personnel who want to add to this effort, who want to be able to be part of a provision going forward in the longer term, to be able to provide a great place for children to be. Let's think about it, in these worst of times, we're asking parents to leave their children so that they can go and do essential work, and some of that essential work is putting themselves at risk, potentially. And we want to give those parents confidence that, when they leave their child with us, that child will receive something really worthwhile, and they can direct all of their attention to doing their job. Janet, have you got a supplementary on schools now, not on early years settings? janet finch-saunders am: I lost the signal before, so it's a little bit confusing at this end, so bear with me. Just in terms of the closure of schools, I have been asked by teachers what does new purpose\u2014you may have covered it, but bear in mind [Inaudible.]\u2014mean in practice. And also, they're already asking what will next\u2014? I know you said earlier that next week could look and probably will look significantly different than this week, but what can they expect to be happening next week in terms of this new purpose work? lynne neagle am: We've covered that, Janet. kirsty williams am: First of all, Janet, I just want to say thank you very much for your kind comments. lynne neagle am: I think you're having trouble hearing us, aren't you, so I think\u2014? janet finch-saunders am: No, I heard that loud and clear. lynne neagle am: But I think you missed the earlier comments, when we went into some detail on the new purpose of schools. dawn bowden am: Just in relation to special schools and how they will fit into this new purpose arrangement. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. steve davies: I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we\u2019ll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school. It\u2019s likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that\u2019s the right thing to do? kirsty williams am: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about. steve davies: The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future. dawn bowden am: We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again? kirsty williams am: If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage? kirsty williams am: Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses\u2014people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that we will continue to pay for childcare, delivered under the childcare offer even when a child is unable, or a parent is unwilling, to take up that place. So, if that setting is receiving a childcare payment from the Welsh Government as part of our childcare offer, that will be paid, regardless of whether that child attends or not. And I know that we're also working with local authorities to ensure a similar position on Flying Start childcare and early education. It's also important that childcare settings will be able to apply for the various packages of support that are being made available by my colleague, Ken Skates. hefin david am: Yes, I'd just like to turn that around from the parents' point of view. With schools closing, there are a lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care. kirsty williams am: Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially\u2014and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan. janet finch-saunders am: Is this the Cylch question? lynne neagle am: Yes, please. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns\u2014[Interruption.] lynne neagle am: We've lost Janet. kirsty williams am: I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014 around service-level agreements are off. [Laughter.] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. lynne neagle am: If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams? kirsty williams am: Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next. janet finch-saunders am: Yes, I think I raised it yesterday, Kirsty, but you were receiving loads of questions. I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me\u2014do you have any advice for them? kirsty williams am: Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade\u2014I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason\u00a0that is. So, just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you're talking about. And, of course, you are right to say that, because we have got some elements of external moderation here, those factors may be less for us in Wales than they might for colleagues in England. kirsty williams am: Yes, I think we are starting at a different base, thank goodness. As I said, students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they're GCSE students. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me\u2014 because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working\u2014how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation process. It may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting. Secondly, you mentioned the AS-levels, of course, as being of value at the moment, but we've got people in Year 12 who now won't be doing their ASs. Is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do? Will they be doing two sets of exams next year, for example? Or is AS just off the table? In which case, how are the A2s going to be calculated in due course? And then, finally from me, we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well\u2014your BTECs, and I think it's the Association of Accounting Technicians, which is a lot of computer-based learning\u2014which is due to be examined within three weeks. I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess? kirsty williams am: With regard to\u00a0AS-levels\u2014no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies\u2014they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board\u2014and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you. suzy davies am: Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. suzy davies am: \u2014is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments? kirsty williams am: Well, potentially, as I said. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades. lynne neagle am: And, just before we move on, have the universities across the UK indicated that they are content with this approach going forward\u2014content to accept students on this basis? kirsty williams am: Certainly. There have been discussions with universities and UCAS, of course, that this also has a bearing on. And the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we've factored in to making these decisions. Those discussions with universities are ongoing, aren't they, Huw? huw morris: Yes. So, we've been in regular conversation with Universities Wales and through them with Universities UK and we've received every indication that the approach that's been adopted here has been welcomed by the institutions. Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide? kirsty williams am: Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions\u2014a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question. Universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them. Colleges are in a similar position, looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, does give us more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector. suzy davies am: I might ask you about that in a minute, because I don't even know what the Bill says yet. kirsty williams am: Huw, I don't know if there's anything you want to add. huw morris: No\u2014just to confirm what's been said and also to add in that independent training providers, similarly autonomous, like colleges and universities, have been moving in the same direction. We've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. We've got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis. huw morris: That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are\u2014in your portfolio. helen mary jones am: Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it? And you don't get your EMA if you don't turn up. Should we take from your last answer that that attendance qualification doesn't apply anymore? kirsty williams am: Yes. They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault. helen mary jones am: No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention? kirsty williams am: Yes. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment? kirsty williams am: Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration. helen mary jones am: Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home\u2014 kirsty williams am: It is their home. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students' basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need? kirsty williams am: Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that. huw morris: We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners. And on this specifically\u2014last question from me\u2014 have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed? huw morris: So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone? kirsty williams am: Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure\u2014which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at\u2014we would expect school staff\u2014well-being staff, for instance in school\u2014to be doing check-ins\u2014phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people\u00a0a range of online facilities that are available\u2014so, for instance, Meic website\u2014so, looking to use a variety of platforms. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children their access to their counsellor is\u00a0via their school. We know that, and we're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists\u2014online counselling tools that children already use because they don't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor. They're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue, as far as possible, those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered, and their worries. One of the reasons, again, that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible\u2014and teachers have been working so hard to do that\u2014is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we've needed and wanted to maintain. Children will have worries about their own health; they'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves. So, we need to understand, and I think we will also have to recognise, that this support will have to be ongoing once we're back to normal, and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience. They are incredibly resilient, and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages. They are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands' and things like that than even adults have been. So, they are incredibly resilient, but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them. helen mary jones am: Can I just\u2014? Just a supplementary to that\u2014you've mentioned already, Kirsty, the importance of youth services, and, particularly thinking voluntarily youth services, you've given the commitment, when were talking about Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin earlier, that services that are part-funded by grants through the Welsh Government, for example, thinking of the national youth voluntary service\u2014will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well? Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time? kirsty williams am: No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public\u2014 helen mary jones am: Because it's not safe. kirsty williams am: \u2014because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying, 'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.' lynne neagle am: Okay, thank you. The normal rules of engagement have to change and, those organisations, we'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal, and we wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that. When we're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children, they have a valuable role to play and I know that local government and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services are already in discussion about how youth services\u2014. Those traditional youth clubs, because of austerity, are not necessarily there anymore, so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work, and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals\u2014if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point? kirsty williams am: I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't\u2014 hefin david am: Can we have a clear line on that? kirsty williams am: We don't want to jeopardise anybody, but as I said, some of the normal services are simply not available as everybody turns their attention to trying to respond to the pandemic. Final question\u2014because I know that the Minister's got a lot of things that she needs to get on with\u2014from Suzy on emergency legislation. suzy davies am: I'm not going to ask you if you'll use any powers you get under the emergency legislation, but are you able to give us some indication of what they might be? kirsty williams am: Sure. For instance, the Bill will provide Welsh Ministers with powers to temporarily close schools or other educational institutions, childcare premises; powers to give temporary continuity direction\u2014so, actually, the other way around, force things to be open\u2014and to be able to direct resources. So, that includes, as I said, I could direct something to stay open if that institution was trying to close down. The powers also give flexibility to maybe be able to direct staff to other institutions that they would not normally work in, if that was part of our resilience needs. We'd also be looking at, for instance, relaxing requirements around ratios in childcare settings, or we might be wanting to do things around food. If there is a continuing role for schools in providing food, we might have to be a bit more flexible about what that might look like. So, those kinds of flexibilities\u2014to be able to suspend things, direct things\u2014that we would not normally have in normal circumstances. And just to finish this one off\u2014you may not be able to answer this one, in all fairness\u2014in those situations where it's the Government who says 'no' to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely? kirsty williams am: I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. kirsty williams am: It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this\u2014it feels like an awfully long time ago now\u2014 you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion. kirsty williams am: So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago. suzy davies am: I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked. kirsty williams am: Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We do recognise what an incredibly challenging time this is, and we'd like to place on record our thanks to all of you for the work that you're doing to try and see us through this crisis. Item 3, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting<doc-sep>I'm very pleased to welcome Meilyr Rowlands, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, Estyn; Jassa Scott, strategic director at Estyn; and Claire Morgan, strategic director at Estyn. Thank you for the papers upfront, in which you say that the most striking feature of the education system, looking forward, of course is the curriculum and the change that that's bringing. How can we be sure that, during this period of change, standards don't slip? And also, from the point of view of scrutiny, will we be back in a situation where we're being told, 'You can't compare one set of results against the previous year's results, because of the nature of the change'? meilyr rowlands: Bore da, bawb. I think any kind of major educational reform has got risks attached to it, particularly if those changes were made too quickly. I think this process of reform has been going on in the background for a few years now, so I think there is a track record of standards and provision not slipping. So, overall, I think we can be fairly confident that standards won't slip during this period of preparation. suzy davies am: Can I just ask: is that based on your evidence around primary schools, where the sort of ethos that we've seen in the curriculum has been already articulated through the foundation phase? meilyr rowlands: The track record I'm talking about is across the board, so it's very difficult to think of anything that's actually got worse over the last three or four years, so it's difficult to say that standards of provision is slipping. It might not be improving as quickly as we would like, but the purpose of major curriculum and, more generally, educational reform is to make sure that we do get a more substantial sort of improvement. A large number of schools and teachers and leaders have been part of preparing the new curriculum and all the associated work, as well as doing the day job. I think their commitment and their engagement with curriculum reform, and engagement with wider education reform, is to be congratulated. So, I think going forward, we must make sure that that is continued; that this process that's called co-construction\u2014engaging with the profession, making sure that they're behind all the changes\u2014continues. I think that's what's going to make sure that we don't see any slippage. suzy davies am: Okay, and on that point of comparing year on year, we will be able to make those comparisons legitimately then? meilyr rowlands: Yes, certainly, in terms of our inspection outcomes and our inspection work, yes. Can I just ask you then about the difference in preparedness between primary and secondary schools, which I've just mentioned previously, and also what your views are on the impact of funding for schools on that as well? Because we're in a situation where a number of primary schools have got surplus funds, sometimes that's because of end of year additional funds just being magicked up, but there is a serious worry that so many secondary schools are in deficit and that, overall, secondary schools are in deficit. Is there a correlation between those two positions, that secondary schools may be less ready for this than primary schools? meilyr rowlands: I think it's probably true to say that secondary schools have a greater challenge than primary schools generally in terms of preparedness for the new curriculum. With any sort of education reform, you've got that danger of people wanting to see change as soon as possible on the one hand, and on the other hand you need time to pilot things, to make sure that people have the right professional learning and make sure that there's opportunity for evaluation and thinking and so forth. suzy davies am: Sorry, that could be difficult to do if a school doesn't have money to create that space, couldn't it? meilyr rowlands: Yes. One, about the difference between primary and secondary: I think what I'm saying there is I think the fact that the new curriculum is going to be brought in for all the years in primary, but it's going to be phased in year by year for secondary is a recognition of that difference. In terms of funding, probably everyone in this room, and certainly me included, would like to see more money for the education system\u2014any educationalist would like to see that. But, you know, that is a decision for local and central Government to decide how much they can afford. suzy davies am: Can I ask, just to keep it on track, are you finding that that's having an impact on secondary schools particularly\u2014their ability to make space to get their heads around the curriculum? meilyr rowlands: I don't think you can make that straightforward correlation. But if you do look at surpluses and reserves, they have been more or less constant for primary schools over a long period of time, but they have declined for secondary schools. So, I think there probably is an argument for saying that we need to look at the funding of secondary schools in particular because, overall, they're in deficit now. The other thing that's worth saying about funding is that even a small decrease in real terms can be disproportionately time consuming to manage. So, you know, if you have a large school and you have to maybe make one member of staff redundant, it can have a real big effect on the morale in the school. But also the time it takes for the headteacher and the senior staff to make those decisions can take their eye off the educational ball because they're looking at these financial and staffing issues. The final question from me is: there's a general concern about the number of teachers that we have in the system at the moment, particularly at secondary level and in particular subjects as well. How do you think we can improve that? What impact is it likely to have on the ability of secondary schools to really get a grip on this? meilyr rowlands: Obviously, the most important resource for the education system is the teachers. So, it is a concern that recruitment is getting more and more difficult and that targets for initial teacher training are not being hit. And we're not seeing them hit, if I remember correctly, even in primary, let alone secondary. So, there is a challenge, and I think we've got to look at this in the round. We've got to make sure that we have both a long-term strategy and a shorter term strategy for this. So, long term, we've got to make sure that education is an attractive option for young people and more mature people to want to go into. I think there's a general acceptance now that that needs to be higher up on the agenda, that people need to take that seriously, and there's work going on regarding the workload issue. suzy davies am: I suppose what I'm coming to, and I will finish with this, Chair, is, we're asking our existing workforce to undertake a fair bit of continuous professional development\u2014let's call it that\u2014in order to get ready for this curriculum when they've barely got time for lunch as it is. Do you think that's going to have an impact on the ability of secondary schools to get to grips with this, albeit that there'll be a phasing in? meilyr rowlands: Yes. I think the new curriculum, one of the things about the new curriculum is that it re-professionalises the profession. And one of the reasons why teaching maybe hasn't been that attractive a profession is that teachers in the past have just been delivering a set curriculum, and now they've got a much more creative part in deciding for themselves how to teach something and what to teach. I think we need to have a much more varied set of routes into teaching, so I welcome some of the part-time Open University courses, for example. So, there are lots of ways\u2014we were talking about maybe converting people from primary into secondary, particularly in Welsh-medium, where there's a shortage. Just before going on to that, just to pick up on that last point that you made about the shortage of teachers and losing teachers during the first year of their training. Has Estyn done any themed work on that particular issue, or do you intend to do anything on that? Also, looking at the financial incentives and how they compare with the situation in England, for example; do we need, perhaps, to think about financial incentives, not just for specific subjects, but for going to schools where there are particular issues, perhaps? meilyr rowlands: Well, yes, there are currently discussions ongoing between us and the Government about working in those early years for teachers. I know that Professor Mick Waters is looking at this currently, and we've had the discussion with him. Now, we are, of course, looking at initial teacher training, but we haven't looked at the first couple of years for many a year. And for your information, I've commissioned a piece of work on that particular issue, and that work will be published in due course. sian gwenllian am: In terms of the secondary schools, that\u2019s where the problem lies, isn\u2019t it, rather than the primary sector. How much of a concern is it to you that children\u2019s chances of going to a secondary school that is good or better appear to be 50:50, and that, indeed, over 10 per cent of secondary schools are judged to be failing and 12 per cent are under Estyn review? How much of a concern is that to you? meilyr rowlands: Well, it is of concern to us, of course. I hope that we will have an opportunity to talk about the positive aspects of the education system in Wales, because there are a number of good things we can report also. The primary sector, the special sector, post-16\u2014there are many sectors that are doing well, and I think a story that's particularly positive this year is that we have seen pupil referral units improving. We have seen examples of excellent practice in that sector for the first time in many a year, and we've also seen excellent practice in independent special schools, which is also a sector\u2014. But, you're right, of course, the biggest concern for the system, I would say, is secondary schools, and that is an issue of leadership, and also of the quality of the teaching and learning. So, I believe that there is a need to find a long-term solution, as I mentioned previously, and also a short-term solution to this problem. In the long term, to improve the quality of teaching and learning\u2014well, that\u2019s the main aim of the new curriculum. It will take time, as we mentioned previously; it will take longer in secondary schools, and that's for a number of reasons, and I have discussed the challenges that are additional for secondary schools in previous annual reports. It\u2019s more difficult to engage with the parents of older children than younger children, and that\u2019s an important factor. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I believe it\u2019s important that we do have community schools that ensure that the parents are part of the school\u2019s life and take an interest in the education of their children. We also know that qualifications take a very prominent role in secondary schools\u2019 mindsets, and, in some cases, perhaps excessively so. So, we need to ensure that those qualifications are reformed as a result of the reform of the curriculum, and, of course, Qualifications Wales is carrying out that work currently. In primary schools, for example, the greatest and most obvious difference, I would say, is that you\u2019ve got one teacher who looks after a child for a whole year, and that teacher can identify the needs of the pupil very well over a period of time, getting to know the child and, possibly, the family very well. It\u2019s much more complicated for secondary school to do that; there have to be systems put in place for that. But in the short term, what is important is that those schools that cause concern receive much more support, and that is why I am glad and do welcome what's being piloted currently, which is a system of supporting these schools, the multi-agency approach, that is. So, that is something that we have been calling for for quite a long period of time and piloted ourselves a few years ago. sian gwenllian am: You said previously that it's a cause of concern for you that these schools that are failing or underachieving are not identified early enough. Are there signs that that's improving? meilyr rowlands: Well, one of the things that's very positive about this pilot scheme is that it's not just the schools that are officially causing concern that are a part of the pilot scheme, that is, the schools that we have identified, through inspections, as needing to be put in a statutory category. So, there are schools involved in the pilot scheme that the authorities and the consortia have identified themselves as schools that are at risk of causing concern. I believe that it's fair to say that we have not reached a point yet where we have a system of agreed criteria in relation to identifying these schools yet. I think that there has been initial work that has been commissioned or that is about to arrive in relation to that, and the types of measures you would expect us to take account of would be dissatisfaction from parents, staff leaving, a change in leadership. We use surveys with the children, for instance, and that gives you quite a good idea of whether a school is possibly facing difficulties. So, there's not one single criteria alone that will tell you, 'This is a school that is at risk of causing concern', but taken together, having a set of criteria that everyone has agreed would be a good way of monitoring schools, I believe. Well, we'll be coming on to that middle tier later on, and perhaps that's where the problem lies, namely that if there isn't an agreed system from consortia and yourselves, perhaps that's where the focus needs to be. meilyr rowlands: I would say that it's not the identification of the schools that is the greatest problem. The greatest problem is ensuring that there is support for them and that the support is multi-agency support, where all the agencies that support these schools are working together. sian gwenllian am: Well, how long does it take, therefore, for a school to move from an improvement category, in terms of special measures, to be escalated then? Because one sees sometimes that there's an excellent school, and within five years' time, it's in the red. meilyr rowlands: Well, that would be something quite unusual\u2014to move from excellent to red. claire morgan: On average, secondary schools that are in need of special measures take just over two years, on average. With primary schools, of course, it's much shorter because the issues are far less complex; it's easier to bring about improvements in teaching. When you've got large numbers of staff, you've got large secondary schools, it takes time to actually bring about those improvements, but it is a long time, just over two years, when you think that some pupils, maybe in key stage 4 for the two years\u2014. Certainly, we want to see schools coming out of category much quicker, and this is where the multi-agency approach certainly is a positive step. They focus on bringing about improvement in the areas of the school that are weakest, and it is the responsibility of everybody involved\u2014that is: ourselves, the regions, local authorities, the schools themselves and their governing bodies\u2014to look at how they can best support the school to bring about that improvement. So, it's getting an agreement on what the issues are, and then planning the support so that we avoid duplication, but that we support the school in the areas they need more support. But, as Meilyr already said, there are some schools involved in that particular pilot that are at danger of causing serious concern. And just finally from me, for the time being at least, the financial situation; we've spoken about that already this morning. If funding was injected into the system tomorrow, say, what would you spend it on? What aspects would benefit from that additional funding? meilyr rowlands: Were you asking about something specific there? sian gwenllian am: In the schools themselves, if you were a school leader, what would you\u2014 meilyr rowlands: Oh, if I were a school leader. How would you use any additional funding that would flow into the school? meilyr rowlands: It's difficult to make that decision, because every school is different. It is important, of course, that leaders do have the power and the ability to make those decisions themselves. But, certainly, in the short term, the type of thing I would have thought would be to prepare for the new curriculum. The schools that have been a part of developing the curriculum have been in a fortunate position in that they've had plenty of time to think about this. So, it's now time\u2014and this was the chief message of my annual report this year\u2014for every school in Wales to start to think. Because I think that the new curriculum is truly an opportunity to take a forward step in terms of how we teach and learn within schools. But that means that time is needed for schools to think this through and, in that thinking, to contact the community, to talk to their children as well, to see what the community in its broader sense would like to see being in the new curriculum, because it's up to every school. Although the new curriculum sets a framework, it is up to each and every school to decide what they're going to teach, and what they're teaching in order to prepare their young people for this new world that we have in the twenty-first century. Therefore, to give you a somewhat superficial answer, I would be setting time aside for the training of teachers. jassa scott: Can I just add one thing there? I think what we've seen over the years recently is that local authorities, to some extent, have safeguarded the funding that goes to the schools, but the effect of that is that we've seen less funding going into some of the local authority services; for example, those services that support well-being, that promote attendance, and that perhaps support behaviour and assistance for schools. So, I think that all of those factors contribute to how schools can support and assist their pupils, and to improve themselves. So, I think that side of things is important as well\u2014in the school or in the local authority, if funding is available, it should be allocated to all of those things so that those services can also support the children to succeed. lynne neagle am: Just before we move on to the middle tier, if I can just ask about the quality of teaching? There's been a consistent message from Estyn that that is the weakest part of the system in Wales. The Government recognises that and has invested a very significant amount of money in that area, yet it's still an issue again in your annual report. What is your assessment of whether we are seeing the improvements we need to see in the quality of teaching? meilyr rowlands: I think, in nearly all the elements of our framework, the picture is fairly similar. So, in terms of quality of teaching, we have seen gradual but quite small-scale improvements in primary. In secondary, it's more or less level; we haven't seen it getting particularly better or particularly worse. One of the things that's really important to realise is that the curriculum is about the quality of teaching. It is about the teaching and learning; those are two sides of the same coin, if you like. From the perspective of the pupil, it's the learning; from the perspective of the teacher, it's the teaching. I think there's no doubt and I think there's general agreement that, in order to have a step change in the quality of teaching and learning\u2014. I think it was Einstein who said that if you keep on doing the same thing, you'll get the same result. So, you're going to have to change something, and what's changing is the curriculum. And that's exactly what all schools need to do now: to think how does this new curriculum affect them in their particular school, in their particular circumstances, in the context of their particular children. How can they use this opportunity now to improve the teaching and learning in their school? lynne neagle am: Si\u00e2n. sian gwenllian am: It does cause one concern, because if the teaching and learning standards just stay the same in the secondary sector, and we know that 12 per cent of secondary schools are under Estyn review and 11 per cent of them are in special measures, we're talking about half of the schools almost, and no improvement in the teaching quality in general. So, there is a major cohort of children captured in that situation, and then there's a new curriculum that comes in. I see the opportunities, but these schools that are doing well are going to go, 'Wow, up there', but schools are there in the bottom layer and one is genuinely concerned about those children in those schools. Isn't that where the focus should be and any additional funding that's allocated? You talked about releasing teachers for training, but perhaps it's in those particular schools that we need to focus. meilyr rowlands: I do agree that the best schools will welcome the opportunities and that their standards will improve even more. But then, with regard to the other schools, in a way, there are two very broad categories, which are those that need only a little support just to help them to improve\u2014. And I believe that the new curriculum and the general support that's going to be surrounding that will be the solution for those schools. But you're right to say that there is another smaller cohort that has a much greater need for support, and they're going to find coping with the new curriculum difficult, because they'll also have many other problems. And you're not talking about a huge number of schools\u2014some 200 secondary schools is what we have in Wales, so that percentage is relatively small, the number is relatively small\u2014but they need much greater support. I don't think it's enormous, but certainly there's a certain amount of funding that is needed to offer those schools that support. The Minister recently told the committee that a number of recent Estyn inspections of local authorities' education services have been disappointing. Do you agree? That, of course, is based on the inspections carried out under the current cycle. But of those nine we've put three into category\u2014we've identified them as causing concern\u2014and they're Pembrokeshire, Powys and Wrexham. So, we've talking quite a bit about secondary schools this morning, and I think that, again, is a factor in those local authorities. You say that the proportion of secondary schools causing concern is a challenge for several local authorities and for the system as a whole. Which local authorities are these\u2014you've probably named them all\u2014and have these been inspected yet under the current cycle? meilyr rowlands: I think you're taking about three secondary schools in a category in Pembrokeshire, Wrexham and Torfaen. So, we've inspected Pembrokeshire and Wrexham already, but we haven't inspected Torfaen yet. And we've inspected Powys and Newport, but we haven't inspected Gwynedd yet. So, in answer to your question: we've inspected most of those, but not all of them. What is your latest assessment of how well the regional consortia are supporting and driving school improvement? Does this vary across the different regions? meilyr rowlands: It certainly does vary, but I'll ask Jassa to go into more detail. jassa scott: We haven't directly inspected the regional consortia since\u2014I think 2017 was the last time we did some direct monitoring with them. But I think, over the last three years, we do feel that they've improved their knowledge. So, they did take a little while to embed, and I think that came across when we did the work that we did with them back in 2017. But, more recently, they've improved their knowledge of individual schools' strengths and areas for improvement, and they are using this knowledge better to support and challenge schools, and particularly schools causing concern. But obviously, as we've been talking about this morning, there's still work to do. I think they've prioritised well the work that schools are doing around literacy and numeracy, but their support for schools to develop digital competence has been a bit weaker. Even though we've had the framework as an early part of the curriculum developments there, we haven't seen quite the focus that we've seen on other areas. I think for schools causing concern, what we found\u2014and we do look at their work through our local authority inspection, so we are getting some first-hand evidence of their impact through that\u2014they're not always focused, in those schools causing concern, on improving teaching and learning, so actually getting in and looking and working with teachers and with staff to actually make improvements there. I think, generally, their support for secondary schools has had less impact across the consortia than it has for primary schools, and I think sometimes that's because they're struggling to recruit appropriate specialists, to support with secondary, or perhaps they don't have the depth of strong practice that we talked about earlier within their region. So, they're having to work a bit harder to find effective practice, to share practice and to get the secondary expertise and knowledge to support those schools. We will be, over the next year, looking specifically at the work of consortia to support curriculum reform work. But that's one of the areas we've discussed, about doing some specific work on over the next year to look in a bit more depth. janet finch-saunders am: So, what is the cycle of inspections for regional consortia, and how robust are those inspections? What areas do you cover? jassa scott: Well, regional consortia aren't actually statutory entities at the moment, and we don't have specific inspection powers relating to regional consortia. So, on each of our local authority inspections, there will be, usually, an area that we're looking at that relates to school improvement, and that would involve us looking at the work of the consortia that the local authority has commissioned. What we've agreed with Welsh Government is that, over the next few years, we will take a thematic approach. So, the first area that we've said is that we'll look specifically at how each of them is supporting curriculum reform, and report on that. So, that will report specifically on the different ones, but it wouldn't be the same as doing an inspection of their work at this time. janet finch-saunders am: Should they be on a statutory footing? jassa scott: Well, I think that's something to be discussed over the next few years. There's, obviously, local government legislation that has been debated recently, which has the potential to create corporate joint committees, and school improvement was one of the areas that is being considered there. So, there may be an opportunity, if that's created, to think how we then adapt inspection to look specifically at that. I think we do get a handle on their work through the local authority and, ultimately, it's looking at what that consortia brings to that local authority and to the schools and the pupils in that area that's the important bit, I think, ultimately, to see the impact there. So, we are looking at them in that way, and then taking that thematic approach, but we'll keep reviewing it over the next couple of years. And what are Estyn's views on the latest position regarding regional working in south-west and mid Wales? Would it be preferable for school improvement advisers to be based in the consortium, Education through Regional Work, rather than each local authority employing their own, as is the case at present? meilyr rowlands: If I can just go back to the last question as well, what we did in order to inspect regions was we paused our local authority inspection cycle back in 2014, I think, for about three years. So, then, we spent time looking at regions, basically, because we didn't have the resource to do both at the same time. So, we're in negotiation with Welsh Government currently, so that, going forward, we can look at local authorities and regions at the same time. If regions become statutory entities, that would be in legislation, and then you could have legislation that gives us directly the powers to inspect them, which we don't currently have. But, as Jassa said, currently, what we intend to do in the short is to do some thematic work on that. In terms of ERW, they were the region that, at the end of the last cycle of regional inspections, we were still monitoring. So, for example, the chair of the joint committee has resigned, the managing director remains a temporary appointment and there are no clear plans for a permanent leadership. Some of the leadership team have left\u2014the capacity has gone down\u2014and various staff that were appointed last summer have already left. The budget has not been agreed and certain key meetings\u2014executive board and joint committee meetings\u2014have been cancelled. So, we are particularly worried about ERW, and, because of that, we will be going in to visit them in April\u2014next month\u2014and we'll be visiting all of the authorities to make sure that they do have a plan for an appropriate school improvement service going forward. jassa scott: Yes, I think you asked a specific question about, you know, which is better. I think our view has been that, generally, the local authorities are too small to deliver that whole range of school improvement services, particularly given the national reform agenda at the moment. We felt last summer, when we went to ERW, that they'd managed to reach the best possible model, given the constraint they've placed, collectively, on themselves\u2014that they want to deliver aspects of school improvement locally, through the local authorities, and have some central capacity. So, we felt that, given that they wanted to do some locally and some centrally, enough thought had been put into that structure last summer and that it could be workable. There were key aspects such as support for secondary schools causing concern and there was some capacity centrally that could support areas such as Powys.\u00a0Unfortunately, as Meilyr has described, some of those aspects have since been disbanded or those staff who were on secondment have gone back, so I think it is a key risk, particularly for some of those authorities you've talked about that are causing concern, such as Powys or Pembrokeshire\u2014that they haven't necessarily got that local capacity to support their schools causing concern. So, you've got some concerns within school capacity and you've got concerns about local authority capacity, and what you don't have there now is that collective capacity centrally that might support them. So, that's why we're going to go and do a slightly more detailed link visit to try to understand how they are mitigating the risks that we see are arising as a result of some of those things that have happened recently. Our understanding is that there's a joint committee meeting of ERW on 19 March, so, hopefully, after that point, we'll have a little bit more information about how they're planning to manage that collective set of services going forward\u2014it's a little bit of an unknown at the moment. meilyr rowlands: You were asking, 'Would it be better for every authority to have their own team?' But, before regions were invented, if you like, we were saying consistently that they tended to be too small. So, you had Cynnal in the north west, you had the Education and School Improvement Service, you had Gwent\u2014so, they naturally did come together in groups, maybe a little bit smaller than the current regions, but they, of their own accord, produced something not very dissimilar to a region. lynne neagle am: Si\u00e2n, did you have a supplementary? sian gwenllian am: Yes, just on ERW. Does the fact that there is a dispute on the highest level feed down to the school and to the children? Are the children in south-west and mid Wales affected by this? Are standards decreasing in that part of Wales? meilyr rowlands: Well, it's difficult to say directly, but we have inspected nine authorities and two of those are in that area, so, the lack of support at that level, as Jassa was saying, may be the reason why those authorities are suffering difficulties. jassa scott: And it is clear that many people across that area are expending energy and time discussing these issues. Any reorganisation does take energy out of the system, so it is clear that that time isn't then being spent, perhaps, on investment in improving schools and supporting staff in schools. So, as Meilyr says, it's not clear, but a lot of energy is being expended in that particular discussion that is ongoing. janet finch-saunders am: What disadvantages could there be from Neath Port Talbot's intention to withdraw from regional working via ERW? And I've got to be honest, up in the north, I know that there are concerns about regional consortia, and when local authorities are under pressure financially, it questions, sometimes, the value of regional consortia. So, what disadvantages could there be from Neath Port Talbot's intention to withdraw from regional working via ERW? meilyr rowlands: I think we've talked in general terms and we feel that local authorities probably are too small on their own. In general terms, you can't say that any particular authority couldn't, maybe, put things together in such a way that it's effective. Also, it has a knock-on effect on the rest of the consortium, if one withdraws. I don't know whether, Jassa, you've got anything to add to the general points we've made. jassa scott: I think, what you've alluded to there, it has the potential to be a destabilising factor across the whole of the national model that we've got for supporting school improvement at a time where Welsh Government are kind of relying heavily on that consortium model to help support curriculum reform and to drive professional learning and be the conduit for lots of the aspects of reform that we've talked about. So, I think that potential risk of any destabilising across the system is a disadvantage generally. And I think it's just what I've already talked about in terms of being a distraction at a crucial time for support where schools need to feel that they're confident in where they need to go for support. I should say that we're planning, as part of that visit that we do in April, to survey schools in that region about the support that they're getting, be that from their authority or from the central teams in ERW. That's something we did at the time when we did the inspections previously, and we thought it would be helpful to get some first-hand views of any disadvantages or impact that they might be feeling, really. And then, finally, for me:what involvement has Estyn had with the strategic education delivery group chaired by Professor Dylan Jones and what are your expectations for how it will improve the work of the middle tier? meilyr rowlands: We've been members of that group right from the beginning. I personally am on it and colleagues are on it as well, and I'm a member of the sub-group that does some of the background work for that group as well, and Estyn has given several presentations to that group. The rather obvious thing is that you get all the strategic educational organisations together in one room, but it had never been done before, as far as I know. I'm a very firm believer in making those relationships, building those relationships, so that people understand what each of us contributes to the whole of the education system. We need to have that forum to be able to make sure that we're clear about what each of our roles is. In your report you talked about in early settings where skills development is less effective, that children begin to feel at a very early age that they can't do certain things. I don't know whether that is anecdotal evidence or is that specific outcome-based evidence\u2014whatever, it's quite worrying. But what do you think the long-term effect on a child's development has in that respect? claire morgan: It's probably worth saying that skill development is a strength in about three quarters of our schools\u2014primary schools and early years settings. But in a minority of schools and settings, as you've picked up, children are often introduced to things too early. So, they're introduced to phonics, they're introduced to learning to read, when they're not at that developmental stage. And really, long term, it means the children lose confidence, because if they're introduced to these things too early they don't succeed, they tend to need additional support, and it can give them a negative impression, it can give them negative thoughts about their ability. So, we need to address that, and really it's about\u2014 dawn bowden am: Sorry, what sort of age range are we talking about here? claire morgan: These would be children from three to five. dawn bowden am: And is there something, then, in that\u2014and I don't think there's much we can do about that, but it may be in terms of the way that the schools or the early learning settings address this\u2014you will have children at a very young age that have almost a year's difference in their age group, so they're born just before 1 September or just after 1 September? So, that's a huge gap, isn't it, at that point in their development? claire morgan: Yes. dawn bowden am: Is that not being addressed in a way that those children are being taught and approached at that age? claire morgan: Yes. In terms of reading and literacy skills, we still remain quite low in the Programme for International Student Assessment ratings for reading, and I know there is a particular concern about the impact on boys in that regard. What do you think are the most pressing priorities that face them around reading and literacy? meilyr rowlands: I think literacy has been, and still is, and still needs to be a top priority. , literacy clearly is something that underpins the rest of education, so it really does need to be a top priority. For example, we've given a lot of attention to writing over the years, and making sure that children get the opportunity to write in an extended way, not just short sentences, but having the opportunity to have extended writing, and there's some evidence that that now is beginning to have an effect. So, it's not just reading small little snippets\u2014we need to encourage children to have a love for reading and read whole books. So, I gave a little bit of attention to that in the annual report\u2014that that needs attention. I think the other thing I would emphasise is that this is not just for the foundation phase, it's not just for very young children\u2014it's really important at key stage 2 and in secondary school. One of the things we have been worried about, and I think there was some reflection of this in PISA, is that there are strengths in reading in Wales. So, PISA, for example, said that children in Wales are very good at comparing lots of little snippets, but what they're saying, and they're saying this themselves, is that the love of books is decreasing, and the number of children who read regularly whole books. So, I think there is something there for teachers to set and model a good example, to show their own interest in reading, to encourage children to read themselves. dawn bowden am: It's probably a wider societal problem as well, isn't it? I'm thinking about gaming, electronic gaming, computers. I think there is some sort of link with the digital world, and the way people read\u2014the actual technique of reading, is evolving. But I think reading is so important, and developing a complex vocabulary is so important in being able to communicate, in order to get a good job, to have enjoyment out of life\u2014all of those things are so important. We ourselves are going to give this quite a lot of priority in future, so we're doing a major piece of work on language acquisition, which will cover some of this next year. Every year one of our thematics is the major bit of work we do, and we try to support that with a conference. So,\u00a0that will be the focus that we give to our work next year\u2014it is on language acquisition. Just one other supplementary on that, I guess, is whether you have a good idea of how many young people are coming out of school at 16\u2014so, those that are not staying on to do A-levels\u2014and are coming out with an inability to read or white. Do we know what the figure is for that? meilyr rowlands: I can't tell you that off the top of my head, but I'm sure that there will be evidence. jassa scott: There has been a shift in that there's been continued emphasis in post-16 education and training around literacy and picking that up. In apprenticeships they'll use essential skills and so on to try and get that basic level of literacy as well, so there is an emphasis. I think one of the worrying indications, maybe, that post-16 sectors find is that sometimes even when learners are coming out with a basic qualification in a GCSE, potentially in English or a literature subject, they don't necessarily have a really good foundation of some of the basic skills as well. Could I just move you on\u2014? Sorry\u2014 meilyr rowlands: The only thing I would add to that is, I guess, it's quite small, the number of people who don't have basic reading. I think one of the things we need to emphasise is that learning reading is something you do throughout your life, and what we need to do is to develop, in particular, pupils' higher level reading skills. The fact that they can just read isn't the end of the story; they need to be developing those higher level reading skills and continuing to widen the range of things they read, and be able to develop their vocabulary at a higher level. meilyr rowlands: Absolutely, yes\u2014those higher level skills of comprehension and inference and those sorts of things. Can I just move you on, then, to numeracy and whether you can tell us if you're satisfied with the progress in numeracy, because I think we were doing better on the PISA results in maths in Wales than we did previously? So, what are your thoughts on that? meilyr rowlands: I think there is a fairly clear good news story here. PISA shows improvements and a lot of that can be attributed, I think, to the new GCSE mathematics numeracy. I think there's much less predictability in that work; you can't approach it in a formulaic way, either the pupils or the teachers in terms of teaching it. It's about applying what you've learnt in the core mathematics lessons to new situations in subjects across the curriculum. I think that that GCSE numeracy has built on the work that's been done lower down on the national numeracy framework, which has the same philosophy of applying that mathematics knowledge in a problem-solving situation. My final question, Chair, is: in your view, to what extent is Wales on track to meet the target of 500 points in each of the domains in the 2020-1 cycle for PISA? meilyr rowlands: I think that that target is somewhat arbitrary, but assuming that we continue on this journey that we are on\u2014the current change programme of the new curriculum and so forth\u2014I think we would expect to see those improvements we've seen in science and in mathematics to continue. The only other thing I would add is that there is some research that indicates or suggests that the effect of schools is greater on mathematics and science than on reading, and the reason for that is you don't do a lot mathematics or science in the home. But the attitude towards reading is very much dependent on family and community factors, more so, maybe, than mathematics and science. So, I think that's another reason why I think a community-school approach is really important. You need to get everybody on board; it's not just what the teacher does in the classroom\u2014it's important that the whole family and the community thinks that reading is important. dawn bowden am: Just on numeracy, it was interesting because one of the schools in my constituency have actually contacted my office and a number of other organisations across the constituency to ask us how we use maths in our work. So, they're obviously trying to relate that now to everyday life and working, which I thought was quite good. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around progress of specific groups of pupils. If I can start and ask you how concerning is it that the gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and other pupils has not narrowed in the last 10 years, especially given the \u00a3475 million pupil deprivation grant investment. I think secondary schools and the issue of poverty were the two things I've noted in the annual report. I think it is worth also remembering that compared to other countries, for example, in PISA, we do compare quite well in terms of equity. There's also an argument that maybe poverty and austerity have increased, so that we're in a way running to keep still. So, there are a lot of caveats to be made around the fact that that poverty gap hasn't closed, but that's not to say that schools can't do something about it, and I've suggested in the annual report a sort of a two-pronged approach. I think there is evidence in the international research that teaching and learning, better teaching and learning, helps disadvantaged poor pupils disproportionately. So, I think improving teaching and learning, and we discussed that earlier this morning about how the new curriculum is really all about improving the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom. So, that's one approach, and then the other approach, which I've also mentioned earlier, is having a community-focused approach to schools. It's very difficult for children to do well in school if they've got all kinds of things happening in their background. So, it's important that schools can maybe signpost those families to other services that can support them and help them. It's challenging for schools to go down this route, and I think the more help we can give schools to take that approach, the better. They have better engagement from parents, from the families, and that then reflects back on the work of the children. jassa scott: And we've just published a collection of good practice about how schools support vulnerable learners, and we'll be teasing out the aspects around community-focused schools a lot more in a report that we'll publish in the next couple of months. So, we've kind of drilled down and looked at what some schools are doing in that area in a bit more detail. Obviously, I think we've all been to schools where the PDG is actually used to engage parents more for exactly the reasons you say. But I just wanted to interrogate the deprivation gap a little bit, because, of course, even though, as you say, there's perhaps more equity in Wales, one of the reasons for that is because our children from better-off backgrounds do less well, and considerably less well than their peers in the other parts of the United Kingdom. So, whereas their attainment gaps are pretty dreadful, that's one of the reasons\u2014that our better-off children aren't doing as well as perhaps they might do. Is that a concern as well? We don't want this rush to the middle, do we? meilyr rowlands: I think it's essential that all groups of pupils do as well as they possibly can, absolutely. So, it's not quite the same issue, but we've talked about the importance of making sure that more able and talented children do well. meilyr rowlands: They're not the same, clearly, because you have more able and talented children from poor backgrounds. Differentiation is a challenge for schools,\u00a0but it's absolutely essential that all groups of children do as well as they possibly can. So, in things like PISA, in terms of reading, for example, we can't just say it's that group that needs to improve\u2014all the groups need to improve. And I think that's why something like the new curriculum gives schools more scope to tailor their teaching and learning to the particular groups that they have, whether they\u2019re more able, whether they're advantaged or whether they're disadvantaged. Pupils' confidence in their school's ability to help them with their emotional and mental well-being is much less at secondary school and that's been a consistent theme as well from your reports. As we mentioned earlier, we do pupil surveys before all our inspections, and across a number of those indicators, like, 'How well does the school listen? Do adults in school care about me? How well does the school deal with bullying?'\u2014quite a lot those ones around well-being do tail off. Nine out of 10 pupils at key stage 2 have that confidence, down to half at key stage 4, as you say. And I think there are a number of factors that we think contribute to that: I think one of the factors is that pupils face, sometimes, more challenges as they get older in those teenage years, but they also become more reflective and perhaps more discerning. And I think what we find in secondary schools is perhaps secondary school pupils notice sometimes the differences between their everyday life that they experience in school and perhaps the messages that they're getting about well-being in terms of their lessons, in terms of assemblies and in terms of school policies and so on. So, they are probably more discerning in noticing those differences and maybe there are some of those differences also there in primary school, but the pupils don't notice. I think we've already touched upon things like the differences in the way that, at primary school, you would tend to have a go-to adult, which is your teacher. The best secondary schools find ways to make sure that pupils do feel that level of support and feel there are trusted people, but it's more of a challenge to make sure that that happens, because of the way they're operating. We still have some concerns about personal and social education and the health and well-being support, which we've made a recommendation about in the past in some of our thematic reports, but also recently in some of our secondary school inspection reports. And I think I already touched upon the fact that sometimes, when the budget is tight, it can be some of those\u2014they're not peripheral in their importance, but they're not the teacher in the classroom: well-being support assistants and so on and family liaison workers\u2014staff in the school who perhaps really support that pastoral care that the school as a whole can provide\u2014it may be that those are the roles that are less prevalent at times of less funding. So, I think there are some great members of staff doing a really good job, but perhaps they're not those members of staff who can support teachers and support pupils in creating that kind of caring environment. So, I think there's not an obvious answer and part of it is that they do become more discerning and perhaps more vocal in those responses generally, as they get older. And that might explain some of the difference with primary, where, generally, they're quite positive about everything across most of the schools that we ask. lynne neagle am: So, it's not that secondary schools\u2014because you've said that in a previous inspection report\u2014are just not as good at prioritising mental health and well-being. jassa scott: I think there's an element that it's more of a challenge for a secondary school to provide an effective set of support from that whole-staff awareness of some of the challenges. And one of the pieces of work we've done recently is around adverse childhood experiences, and we have found that primary schools have taken that and embraced it. So, maybe not every member of staff has the same level of understanding, but also those staff aren't spending the same amount of time with pupils. So, in terms of getting to know pupils, picking up on signs that they may be struggling, or that there might be concerns\u2014it's much more of a challenge. You've got to work a lot harder as a secondary school to make sure that staff have that knowledge and that you've got the tracking systems that can put those different bits of\u00a0 information together to actually mean that you can target support where it's needed. Obviously, we've had one case in north Wales, in an independent school, where there were serious concerns. What's that done to your desire to monitor and check what's going on in these independent schools? Are they regulated sufficiently? jassa scott: I'll pick up on that as well. So, some have boarding provision, and where they have boarding provision, Care Inspectorate Wales would look at the boarding side of it, we'd look at the educational side of it. There are others where they may have a linked children's home, which can be another room in the same house, or it can be a number of miles away, and similarly there CIW would look at the residential aspects of the care and we'd look at the school. So, I think, there's a focus in the independent school standards regulations, which is a minimum that all schools have to meet to maintain a registration. There is a focus in that on how that school looks after and cares for its pupils, and there are focuses on that element of boarding provision where relevant, and the national minimum standards that the care inspectorate look at that have aspects around supporting well-being as well. What we do find in our inspections is that, overall, we generally find that pupils' well-being develops, they make good progress, and that care, support and guidance that schools give is good. What we mean by that, really, practically, is that they are developing their resilience and their self-esteem. In special schools, this might mean particularly that those pupils learn to manage their anxieties better so that they improve their behaviour, which may be one of the reasons why they're in that specialist setting. In mainstream independent schools, what we find is that people develop their tenacity, their curiosity for learning\u2014their resilience in that way. For example, there was one school where we found that they weren't making appropriate referrals to child and adolescent mental health services. So, these schools do operate independently by their nature, and their awareness, perhaps, of some of the guidance and support that is out there\u2014sometimes, maybe, there can be more to be done, and I think we've talked to Welsh Government about that. suzy davies am: What's Estyn's role in that\u2014to bring that level of awareness to those schools? jassa scott: I think we do through our inspection guidance, and the independent school standards do refer to Welsh Government guidance\u2014it's something like 'Keeping learners safe', which is a really key document, which supports safeguarding and caring across schools. So, I think the other area is that sometimes we don't have the intelligence about what\u2014. So, for example, if there's been a safeguarding referral from a school, we don't necessarily always get that information, which means that when we do go to inspect, we may not have the full picture to help us tailor our inspection activity. So, that's something we've raised\u2014 lynne neagle am: [Inaudible.]\u2014be brief and brief in answers. Do you mind if I move on to the next question? lynne neagle am: We're going to have to skip those, I'm afraid, and talk to the last set of questions, just because of the time pressures. What role, if any, did Estyn have in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's latest review of progress in school improvement when they visited Wales in late 2019? meilyr rowlands: Well, we were interviewed. Therefore, the three of us had an interview with the OECD officials and we offered evidence to them. And I think that, when the report is published, you will see that the OECD does draw on our broader evidence and will be quoting our reports\u2014the annual report and some of our thematic reports. How significant a role do you believe the national evaluation and improvement resource will play in raising school standards? meilyr rowlands: I think that it's very important. It's Claire who has been specifically tasked with that, so I'll ask Claire to speak about it. claire morgan: I think working together with the practitioners, the regions and representatives from local authorities is a great opportunity to develop a national approach, because we know across Wales there's some excellent practice, but we know there are schools that struggle to bring about improvement. So, this national resource has the potential to provide schools with detailed guidance on how they can approach not only self-evaluation, but, more importantly, how they can bring about that improvement. Half of those have been involved in developing the tools and approaches right from the start, and 22 new schools have come on board this year. But we anticipate that there will be lots of tools and approaches within that resource that schools can use to improve the quality of self-evaluation throughout the school, primaries, secondaries, PRUs and special schools. But it will focus on establishing a culture within the school that focuses on improvement, that establishes a reflective culture where all staff are involved in development. So, we're hoping that this tool\u2014it's still currently in development, but we hope that that will support schools really well. And, with regard to comparison of performance, does the lack of comparative attainment data raise difficulties when you're inspecting and drawing conclusions and standards in schools? meilyr rowlands: Not really, no. I think there was a bit of a myth that a lot of this performance data was just for Estyn, but actually it never has been. We look at standards, we look at teaching and learning in the classroom, we look at well-being, we look at care support and guidance, we look at leadership, we look at all of these things, and we look at it based on first-hand evidence\u2014what we actually see in the classroom. So, we're quite happy to continue to inspect schools, and we in fact support having less emphasis on data because, although data is useful, and we hope that schools will continue to analyse their data and use that data to help them self-improve and self-evaluate, we don't actually need it and it has actually created a bit of a high-stakes culture. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you all for your attendance? As usual, you'll receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Paper to note 1 is a ministerial update on the emotional and mental health of children and young people in Wales\u2014next steps for 'Mind over matter'. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Housing and Local Government regarding teachers' pay and pensions, and paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education from us regarding the school funding review. Can I then propose under Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Great"
