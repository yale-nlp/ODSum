        "Query": "What were the Professor's thoughts on the results and clustering in language generation?",
        "Summary": "Summary:\nThe professor expressed surprise at the better-than-expected results and concluded that MSG had no impact. However, he observed that the inclusion of French and Spanish in the multilingual English model had a negative effect. The professor was not enthusiastic about clustering and suggested giving more weight to the most promising bands in the model. Currently, the model treated all bands equally. In terms of the SmartKom generation module, the syntax-to-prosody rules for English will be rewritten, and OGI will provide a variety of synthesizer voices to choose from.",
        "Article": "phd e: Ah grad f: Wh - what causes the crash ? phd a: Did you fix something ? phd c: Hello . grad f: Oh , maybe it 's the turning turning off and turning on of the mike , right ? professor b: you think that 's you ? Oh . phd e: Mmm , channel five ? Doesn't work ? professor b: Yeah , that 's the mike number there , mike number five , and channel channel four . So  I also copied  the results that we all got in the mail I think from  from OGI and we 'll go go through them also . phd d: The PLP , the PLP with JRASTA , the MSG , and the MFCC from the baseline Aurora . We 've trained  several neural networks on so on the TI - digits English and on the Italian data and also on the broad  English  French and  Spanish databases . Mmm , so there 's our result tables here , for the tandem approach , and  , actually what we we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well . Our our  There 's a We 're pausing for a photo phd c: Chicken on the grill . phd a: How about over th from the front of the room ? phd c: Yeah , it 's longer . And  actually we have  , results are similar Only on , phd a: Do you mean if it 's trained only on On data from just that task , phd d: yeah . But actually we didn't train network on  both types of data   phonetically ba phonetically balanced  data and task data . So , professor b: So how  clearly it 's gonna be good then phd a: So what 's th professor b: but the question is how much worse is it if you have broad data ?  , my assump From what I saw from the earlier results ,  I guess last week , was that  , if you trained on one language and tested on another , say , that the results were were relatively poor . professor b: But but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another , does that is that improve things i c in comparison ? phd d: If we use the same language ? professor b: No , no , no . Different lang So  If you train on TI - digits and test on Italian digits , you do poorly , let 's say . professor b: I don't have the numbers in front of me , phd d: But Yeah but I did not  do that . E So , you didn't train on TIMIT and test on on Italian digits , say ? phd d: We No , we did four four kind of of testing , actually . The second test is trained on a single language  with broad database , but the same language as the t task data . The third test is by using ,  the three language database professor b: W which in phd d: and the fourth is professor b: It has three languages . That 's including the w the the phd d: This includes professor b: the one that it 's phd d: Yeah . phd d: Yeah And the fourth test is  excluding from these three languages the language that is the task language . So  for  TI - digits for ins example  when we go from TI - digits training to TIMIT training  we lose  around ten percent ,  . And then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's  it become worse and , well Around  , let 's say , twenty perc twenty percent further . phd d: But the first step is al already removing the task s specific from from phd a: Already , right right right . phd a: So they were sort of building here ? phd d: And we lose phd a: OK ? phd d: Yeah .  So , basically when it 's trained on the the multilingual broad data  or number so , the the ratio of our error rates  with the baseline error rate is around  one point one . professor b: I i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline , you get something like one point one for the for the using the same language but a different task , and something like one point three for three three languages broad stuff . phd d: Tas - task data professor b: I I I meant something different by baseline phd d: we are u Yeah . professor b: So if we call a factor of w just one , just normalized to one , the word error rate that you have for using TI - digits as as training and TI - digits as test , phd d: Mmm . professor b: If we call that \" one \" , then what you 're saying is that the word error rate for the same language but using  different training data than you 're testing on , say TIMIT and so forth , it 's one point one . professor b: you do go to three languages including the English , it 's something like one point three . professor b: And if you exclude English , from this combination , what 's that ? phd d: If we exclude English ,  there is not much difference with the data with English . So what what it 's saying here is just that \" yes , there is a reduction in performance , when you don't  have the s when you don't have  phd a: Task data . So it 's So when you go to a different task , there 's actually not so different . It 's when you went to these So what 's the difference between two and three ? Between the one point one case and the one point four case ? I 'm confused . The only difference it 's is that it 's multilingual  professor b: Cuz in both in both both of those cases , you don't have the same task . professor b: So is is the training data for the for this one point four case does it include the training data for the one point one case ? phd d:  yeah . professor b: How m how much bigger is it ? phd d:  It 's two times , grad f: Yeah ,  . professor b: So it 's two times , but it includes the but it includes the broad English data . professor b: So you have band - limited TIMIT , gave you  almost as good as a result as using TI - digits on a TI - digits test . OK ? phd d:  ? professor b:  and  But , when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size , it  performs worse on the TI - digits . OK , now all of this is This is noisy TI - digits , I assume ? Both training and test ? phd d:  professor b: Yeah . We we we may just need to  So  it 's interesting that h going to a different different task didn't seem to hurt us that much , and going to a different language  It doesn't seem to matter The difference between three and four is not particularly great , so that means that whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal . professor b: It sounds like   we may need to have more of  things that are similar to a target language or  . You have the same number of parameters in the neural net , you haven't increased the size of the neural net , and maybe there 's just just not enough complexity to it to represent the variab increased variability in the in the training set .  So , what about So these are results with  th that you 're describing now , that they are pretty similar for the different features or or  phd d: let me check . For the PLP with JRASTA the the we This is quite the same tendency , with a slight increase of the error rate ,  if we go to to TIMIT . There there is a difference actually with b between PLP and JRASTA is that JRASTA seems to perform better with the highly mismatched condition but slightly slightly worse for the well matched condition . professor b: I have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this ? Cuz we 're all sort of If we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , I think it 'd be phd d: Yeah , yeah . professor b: I 'll I 'll sing a song or dance or something while you do it , too . phd a: The  What was Was this number forty or It was roughly the same as this one , he said ? When you had the two language versus the three language ? professor b:  . That 's interesting because it it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt  because you  didn't have so much representation of English , because in the other case you don't get hurt any more , at least when it seemed like  it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse , phd a:   I wonder were  all three of these nets using the same output ? This multi - language  labelling ? grad f: He was using  sixty - four phonemes from SAMPA . phd a: So this would From this you would say , \" well , it doesn't really matter if we put Finnish into the training of the neural net , if there 's gonna be , you know , Finnish in the test data . \" Right ? professor b: Well , it 's it sounds  , we have to be careful , cuz we haven't gotten a good result yet . professor b: But I I I I think it does suggest that it 's not so much   cross language as cross type of speech . professor b: It 's it 's  But we did Oh yeah , the other thing I was asking him , though , is that I think that in the case Yeah , you you do have to be careful because of com compounded results . I think we got some earlier results in which you trained on one language and tested on another and you didn't have three , but you just had one language . Didn - Wasn't there something of that ? Where you , say , trained on Spanish and tested on on TI - digits , or the other way around ? Something like that ? phd e: No . professor b: This may have been what I was asking before , Stephane , but but , wasn't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ?  no no mixture but just grad f: I 'll get it for you . professor b: We 've never just trained on one lang phd d: Training on a single language , you mean , and testing on the other one ? professor b: Yeah . phd d: So the only task that 's similar to this is the training on two languages , and that professor b: But we 've done a bunch of things where we just trained on one language . Either thi this is test with  the same language but from the broad data , or it 's test with  different languages also from the broad data , excluding the So , it 's it 's three or three and four . phd e: The early experiment that phd a: Did you do different languages from digits ? phd d:  . You mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ? phd a: Digits on another language ? phd d: No . professor b:  What phd c: These numbers are  ratio to baseline ? professor b: So ,  wha what 's the phd d: So . professor b: This this chart this table that we 're looking at is  , show is all testing for TI - digits , or ? grad f: Bigger is worse . phd d: The upper part is for TI - digits grad f: Yeah , yeah , yeah . phd d: And the first four rows is well - matched , then the s the second group of four rows is mismatched , and finally highly mismatched . professor b: Well , What was is that i What was it that you had done last week when you showed Do you remember ? Wh - when you showed me the your table last week ? phd d: It - It was part of these results . phd a: So where is the baseline for the TI - digits located in here ? phd d: You mean the HTK Aurora baseline ? phd a: Yeah . professor b:   let 's see PLP  with on - line normalization and delta - del so that 's this thing you have circled here in the second column , phd d: Yeah . Actually I I  forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on  features without the s derivatives  but with increased frame numbers . And we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it it 's slightly slightly worse when we don't use delta but it 's not not that much . What 's MF , MS and ME ? phd a: Multi - French , Multi - Spanish phd d: So . professor b: OK so I think what I 'm what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was was there were some numbers I saw , I think , that included these multiple languages and it and I was seeing that it got worse . In fact it might have been just this last category , having two languages broad that were where where English was removed . What I we hadn't seen yet was that if you added in the English , it 's still poor . professor b:   now , what 's the noise condition  of the training data phd d: Still poor . The noise condition is the same It 's the same  Aurora noises  , in all these cases for the training . professor b: So there 's not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between  the training and test phd d: No these are the s s s same noises , professor b: and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect phd d: yeah . At least at least for the first for the well - matched , grad f: Well matched condition . professor b: So there 's some kind of a a an effect from having these  this broader coverage  Now I guess what we should try doing with this is try testing these on u this same sort of thing on you probably must have this lined up to do . So what appears is that perhaps Spanish is not very close to Italian because  , well , when using the the network trained only on Spanish it 's the error rate is almost  twice the baseline error rate . Is there any difference in So it 's in the  So you 're saying that when you train on English and  and and test on phd d: Yeah . professor b: No , you don't have training on English testing phd d: There there is another difference , is that the noise the noises are different . professor b: In in what ? phd d: Well , For for the Italian part  the  the  networks are trained with noise from Aurora TI - digits , phd e: Aurora - two . professor b: Do we have any  test sets  in any other language that  have the same noise as in the Aurora ? phd d: And phd e: Mmm , no . phd a: Can I ask something real quick ? In in the upper part in the English stuff , it looks like the very best number is sixty point nine ? and that 's in the  the third section in the upper part under PLP JRASTA , sort of the middle column ? phd d: Yeah . phd a: So that 's matched training ? Is that what that is ? phd d: It 's no , the third part , so it 's  highly mismatched . phd a: So why do you get your best number in Wouldn't you get your best number in the clean case ? phd c: Well , it 's relative to the  baseline mismatching phd d: Yeah . And then so , in the in the  in the non - mismatched clean case , your best one was under MFCC ? That sixty - one point four ? phd d: Yeah . But , what is  what is currently running , that 's  , i that just filling in the holes here or or ? pretty much ? phd d: no we don't plan to fill the holes professor b: OK . phd d: but actually there is something important , is that  we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization and we just noticed  recently that  the approach that we were using was not  leading to very good results when we used the straight features to HTK . So basically d if you look at the at the left of the table , the first  row , with eighty - six , one hundred , and forty - three and seventy - five , these are the results we obtained for Italian  with straight mmm , PLP features using on - line normalization . And the , mmm what 's in the table , just at the left of the PLP twelve on - line normalization column , so , the numbers seventy - nine , fifty - four and  forty - two are the results obtained by  Pratibha with  his on - line normalization  her on - line normalization approach . phd a: Where is that ? seventy - nine , fifty professor b: it 's just sort of sitting right on the  the column line . So these are the results of OGI with on - line normalization and straight features to HTK . And the previous result , eighty - six and so on , are with our features straight to HTK . phd d: So what we see that is there is that   the way we were doing this was not correct , but still the networks are very good . professor b: So , do you know what was wrong with the on - line normalization , or ? phd d: Yeah . There were diff there were different things and basically , the first thing is the mmm , alpha  value . I assume that this was not important because  previous results from from Dan and show that basically the both both values g give the same same  results . Actually ,  what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . phd d: And Pratibha did something different is that he  she initialed the  values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance . There were other minor differences , the fact that she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen , and that she used C - zero instead of log energy .  , I changed the code  and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the OGI baseline . phd d: We It it 's slightly  different because I don't exactly initialize the same way she does . Actually I start , mmm , I don't wait to a fifteen twenty - five twenty - five frames before computing a mean and the variance to e to to start the recursion . phd d: I I use the on - line scheme and only start the re recursion after the twenty - five twenty - fifth frame . So  I retrained the networks with these well , the the the networks are retaining with these new features . phd d: So basically what I expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much professor b: Right . It it will learn how to normalize and professor b: OK , but I think that given the pressure of time we probably want to draw because of that especially , we wanna draw some conclusions from this , do some reductions in what we 're looking at , phd d: Yeah . professor b: and make some strong decisions for what we 're gonna do testing on before next week . So do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with  multi - band or on on this , phd d: Yeah I professor b: or ? phd d: No , I we plan to start this  so , act actually we have discussed  @ @  , these what we could do more as a as a research and and we were thinking perhaps that  the way we use the tandem is not  , well , there is basically perhaps a flaw in the in the the stuff because we trained the networks If we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task , professor b:   phd d: what we ask is to the network is to put the bound the decision boundaries somewhere in the space . phd d: And  mmm and ask the network to put one , at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary and one for another phoneme at the other side . And so there is kind of reduction of the information there that 's not correct because if we change task and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task , obviously the decision boundaries are not should not be at the same place . professor b: I di phd d: But the way the feature gives The the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the it removes completely the information a lot of information from the the features by   placing the decision boundaries at optimal places for one kind of data but this is not the case for another kind of data . professor b: It 's a trade - off , phd d: So professor b: right ? Any - anyway go ahead . So  what we were thinking about is perhaps  one way to solve this problem is increase the number of outputs of the neural networks .  , I I think you could make the same argument , it 'd be just as legitimate , for hybrid systems as well . phd d: Yeah but , we know that professor b: And in fact , th things get better with context dependent versions . professor b: Yeah , but it 's still true that what you 're doing is you 're ignoring you 're you 're coming up with something to represent , whether it 's a distribution , probability distribution or features , you 're coming up with a set of variables that are representing  , things that vary w over context . So , for that reason , when you in in in a hybrid system , when you incorporate context one way or another , you do get better scores . I I 'm I 'm sort of And once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is  much more  specific to a particular task in language . So   , the the acoustics associated with  a particular context , for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , so the qu the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder . We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data  phd d: Yeah , but mmm , the the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions . professor b: It 's and and it is true that if there 's two phones that are very similar , that  the i it may prefer one but it will give a reasonably high value to the other , too . Yeah , sure but  So basically it 's almost binary decisions and  the idea of using more classes is to get something that 's less binary decisions . Because then you would say that in that this phone in this context is a one , but the same phone in a slightly different context is a zero . phd d: But yeah , but professor b: That would be even even more distinct of a binary decision . phd d: Yeah , but if professor b:  for instance , the the thing I was arguing for before , but again which I don't think we have time to try , is something in which you would modify the code so you could train to have several outputs on and use articulatory features phd d: Mmm . professor b: cuz then that would that would go that would be much broader and cover many different situations . Yeah , but I think Yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features . phd d: because it 's it 's information that helps to discriminate , professor b:   phd d: if it 's possible to be able to discriminate among the phonemes in context . phd d: But the professor b:  we we could disagree about it at length phd d: Mmm . professor b: but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it phd d: Mmm . But but what I 'm more concerned with now , as an operational level , is  , you know , phd d: Mmm . professor b: what do we do in four or five days ?  , and so we have to be concerned with Are we gonna look at any combinations of things , you know once the nets get retrained so you have this problem out of it . professor b: are we going to look at multi - band ? Are we gonna look at combinations of things ?  , what questions are we gonna ask ,  now that , we should probably turn shortly to this O G I note .  , how are we going to combine with what they 've been focusing on ?  ,  we haven't been doing any of the L D A RASTA sort of thing . professor b: And they , although they don't talk about it in this note , there 's  , the issue of the  Mu law business  versus the logarithm , so . professor b: So what i what is going on right now ? What 's right you 've got nets retraining , Are there is there are there any H T K trainings testings going on ? phd d: N phd e: I I I 'm trying the HTK with eh , PLP twelve on - line delta - delta and MSG filter together .  professor b: And is this with the revised on - line normalization ? phd e: Ye -  , with the old older , phd d: Yeah . professor b: but again we have the hope that it We have the hope that it maybe it 's not making too much difference , phd e: Yeah . Well , something using place of articulation which which leads to nine , I think , broad classes . And then , something that combine both , and we have twenty f twenty - five ? grad f: Twenty - seven . professor b: So what you do  I just wanna understand phd d:  For the moments we do not don't have nets , professor b: so You have two net or three nets ? Was this ? How many how many nets do you have ? No nets . phd d: It 's just Were we just changing the labels to retrain nets with fewer out outputs . So you 're having multiple nets and combining them , or ?  , how are you how are you coming up with If you say  If you have a place characteristic and a manner characteristic , how do you phd d: It - It 's the single net , phd a: I think they have one output . grad f:  -  phd d: if we have twenty - seven classes , professor b: I see . professor b: So you 're sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago instead of yeah . I think it will get worse because Well , I believe the effect that of of too reducing too much the information is basically basically what happens professor b:  - huh . phd d: and professor b: But you think if you include that plus the other features , phd d: but Yeah , because there is perhaps one important thing that the net brings , and OGI show showed that , is the distinction between sp speech and silence Because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition . So this is one thing And But perhaps , something intermediary using also some broad classes could could bring so much more information . professor b: And then  , just to remind me , all of that goes into  , that all of that is transformed by  , K - KL or something , or ? phd d:   phd d: or  , phd e: No transform the PLP phd d: per phd e: and only transform the other I 'm not sure . professor b: Well no , phd d: This is still something that professor b: I think I see . phd d: yeah , we don't know professor b: So there 's a question of whether you would phd e: Two e @ @ it 's one . So that 's something that you 're you haven't trained yet but are preparing to train , and phd d: Yeah . professor b: So I think , you know , we need to choose the choose the experiments carefully , so we can get  key key questions answered  before then phd d:   professor b: and leave other ones aside even if it leaves incomplete tables someplace , it 's it 's really time to time to choose .  professor b: OK , so  , Something I asked So they 're they 're doing the the VAD I guess they mean voice activity detection So again , it 's the silence So they 've just trained up a net which has two outputs , I believe .  I asked  Hynek whether I haven't talked to Sunil I asked Hynek whether they compared that to just taking the nets we already had and summing up the probabilities . To get the speech voice activity detection , or else just using the silence , if there 's only one silence output . But on the other hand , maybe they can get by with a smaller net and maybe sometimes you don't run the other , maybe there 's a computational advantage to having a separate net , anyway . professor b: there 's a an example or two that you can find , where it made it slightly worse , but  in in all but a couple examples .  how are trained the the LDA filter ? How obtained the LDA filter ? phd d: Mmm . phd e: Yeah ,  for example , LDA filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . phd e: And maybe for the Italian , for the TD TE on for Finnish , these filter are are obtained with their own training set . That 's that 's so that 's a that 's a very good question , then now that it I understand it . It 's \" yeah , where does the LDA come from ? \" In the In earlier experiments , they had taken LDA from a completely different database , right ? phd e: Yeah . Yeah , because maybe it the same situation that the neural network training with their own phd d: Mmm .  , but  to tell you the truth , I wasn't actually looking at the LDA so much when I I was looking at it I was mostly thinking about the the VAD . And  , it ap it ap Oh what does what does ASP ? Oh that 's phd d: The features , yeah . phd e: what is what is the difference between ASP and  baseline over ? phd c: ASP . professor b: And it 's This is mostly better than baseline , although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases . professor b: I think this was I think this is the same point we were at when when we were up in Oregon . phd d: I think I think it 's the C - zero using C - zero instead of log energy . phd a: They s they say in here that the VAD is not used as an additional feature . professor b: Shouldn't it be phd d: Because phd a: Does does anybody know how they 're using it ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: if you look down at the block diagram , they estimate they get a they get an estimate of whether it 's speech or silence , phd a: But that professor b: and then they have a median filter of it . professor b: You find stretches where the combination of the frame wise VAD and the the median filter say that there 's a stretch of silence . professor b: Right ? So  phd a: So it 's it 's I don't understand . You mean it 's throwing out frames ? Before professor b: It 's throwing out chunks of frames , yeah . There 's the the median filter is enforcing that it 's not gonna be single cases of frames , or isolated frames . professor b: So it 's throwing out frames and the thing is  , what I don't understand is how they 're doing this with H T phd a: Yeah , that 's what I was just gonna ask . professor b: This is phd a: How can you just throw out frames ? professor b: Yeah . Well , you you can , phd d: i professor b: right ?  y you you phd d: Yeah . Yeah , so  in the i i in the in the decoding , you 're saying that we 're gonna decode from here to here . professor b: I think they 're they 're they 're treating it , you know , like  well , it 's not isolated word , but but connected , you know , the the phd a: In the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of . No they they have numbers though , right ? So I think they 're they 're doing something like that . I think that they 're they 're I think what  by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that 's plausible for the standard . In other words , it 's   from the point of view of of  reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it 's not a bad idea to detect silence anyway . I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this . But it 's the thing is it 's that that that 's that 's I I Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice ,   for listening to , is that these kinds of things  cut speech off a lot . professor b: It does introduce delays but they 're claiming that it 's it 's within the the boundaries of it . professor b: And the LDA introduces delays , and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it doesn't introduce  , any more delay . I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same time the LDA down here I don't know Wh what 's the difference between TLDA and SLDA ? phd c: Temporal and spectral . The temporal LDA does in fact include the same so that I think he well , by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means if you construct it this way , this this delay would work in that way phd a: Ah . So  I think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gonna give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation .  , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants has has approached improving them . So it 's possible that a lot of the problems with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models to begin with . So  The question we 're gonna wanna go through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been if you look at what we 've been trying , we 're  looking at  , by then I guess , combinations of features and multi - band  , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues . And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about  what do we choose from what we 've looked at to  blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at And once we choose that , how do we split up the effort ?  , because we still have even once we choose , we 've still got  another month or so ,  there 's holidays in the way , but but  I think the evaluation data comes January thirty - first so there 's still a fair amount of time to do things together it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites in that that amount of time . phd a: When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's knows when it 's time to back trace or something ? professor b: Well , see they , I I think they 're  . They 're they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to  , change the scripts for the recognizer , I believe . professor b:  that 's sort of what the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side , yeah you p put some low level noise or something . professor b: Most recognizers don't like zeros but but you know , put some epsilon in or some rand phd a: Yeah .  i w Or something professor b: Maybe not a constant but it doesn't ,  don't like to divide by the variance of that , but  it 's phd a: That 's right . or else ,   maybe there is some indicator to tell it to start and stop , I don't know . Otherwise , if it 's just a bunch of speech , stuck together professor b: No they 're phd a: Yeah . And   I think  , I wanna look at these numbers off - line a little bit and think about it and and talk with everybody  , outside of this meeting .  , but  No  it sounds like  there there there are the usual number of of little little problems and bugs and so forth but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out . And now we 're seem to be kind of in a position to actually  , look at stuff and and and compare things .  I don't know what the One of the things I wonder about , coming back to the first results you talked about , is is how much ,  things could be helped by more parameters . Because anyway when we go to twice as much data and have the same number of parameters , particularly when it 's twice as much data and it 's quite diverse , I wonder if having twice as many parameters would help . How are we doing on the resources ? Disk , and phd d: I think we 're alright , professor b: OK . professor b: Are were you folks using Gin ? That 's a that just died , you know ? phd d: Mmm , no . professor b: That 'll be It 's a seven hundred fifty megahertz  SUN phd d:  . grad g: Do we Do we have that big new IBM machine the , I think in th professor b: We have the little tiny IBM machine that might someday grow up to be a big IBM machine . It 's got s slots for eight ,  IBM was donating five , I think we only got two so far , processors . So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . So I don't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time  with it , but  Hopefully , they 'll get us some more parts , soon and  , yeah , I think that 'll be once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine . grad g: And if we can do things on Linux , some of the machines we have going already , like Swede ? professor b:   And it does have two processors , you know and Somebody could do you know , check out  the multi - threading libraries . And  i it 's possible that the  , I guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there aren't five or eight . There 's there 's there 's gonna be debugging hassles and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight , to have it really be useful . You don't get the don't get the visuals but grad g: I is it  mostly  the neural network trainings that are  slowing us down or the HTK runs that are slowing us down ? professor b: I think yes .  , Isn't that right ?  I think you 're you 're sort of held up by both , right ? If the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still wouldn't be anything running through these a hundred times faster because you 'd be stuck by the HTK trainings , phd d: Mmm . professor b: But if the HTK  I think they 're both It sounded like they were roughly equal ? Is that about right ? phd d: Yeah . grad g: Because ,  I think that 'll be running Linux , and Sw - Swede and Fudge are already running Linux so ,  I could try to get  the train the neural network trainings or the HTK stuff running under Linux , and to start with I 'm wondering which one I should pick first . professor b: probably the neural net cuz it 's probably it it 's it 's  Well , I I don't know . They both HTK we use for  this Aurora stuff   , I think It 's not clear yet what we 're gonna use for trainings  Well , there 's the trainings  is it the training that takes the time , or the decoding ?  , is it about equal between the two ? For for Aurora ? phd d: For HTK ? professor b: For Yeah . Well , I don't know how we can I don't know how to Do we have HTK source ? Is that Yeah . professor b: You would think that would fairly trivially the training would , anyway , th the testing  I don't I don't think would parallelize all that well . But I think that you could certainly do d  , distributed , sort of Ah , no , it 's the each individual sentence is pretty tricky to parallelize . phd a: They have a they have a thing for doing that and th they have for awhile , in H T And you can parallelize the training . professor b: Yeah ? phd a: And run it on several machines professor b: Aha ! phd a: and it just basically keeps counts . phd a: I don't what their scripts are set up to do for the Aurora stuff , but phd d: Yeah . professor b: Something that we haven't really settled on yet is other than this Aurora stuff ,  what do we do , large vocabulary training slash testing for  tandem systems . So I I think the the advantage of going with the neural net thing is that we 're gonna use the neural net trainings , no matter what , for a lot of the things we 're doing , grad g: OK . professor b: whereas , w exactly which  Gaussian - mixture - based  thing we use is gonna depend  So with that , maybe we should  go to our digit recitation task . I think we can @ @ You know Herve 's coming tomorrow , right ? Herve will be giving a talk , yeah , talk at eleven . Did  , did everybody sign these consent Er everybody Has everyone signed a consent form before , on previous meetings ? You don't have to do it again each time Yes "

        "Query": "Summarize the feedback and suggestions for the prototype of the remote, including the special features discussed.",
        "Summary": "The remote design was praised by the marketing team for its user-friendly layout, allowing users to easily reach all buttons with one thumb, regardless of hand size. The prominent placement of the on-off button and attractive colors were also noted as positive features. To cater to both left- and right-handed individuals, mute buttons were positioned on either side. For international appeal, channel buttons would be labeled with numbers while the rest would feature easily recognizable symbols. Marketing also suggested incorporating a humorous element into the shell design, playing on the concept of a rapid snail. The user interface and industrial designers agreed on this idea. The remote's unique selling points would include voice recognition, a feature not commonly found in remotes within the same price range, and its adorable appearance, with the snail image serving as a visual attraction. However, practicality would not be a standout feature, as it was assumed that all competitors would offer this.",
        "Article": "Right so  this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Right so  , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , and gonna go through you ,  whoever wants to go first is f fine by me  and we'll collate what we know about  what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . And then we'll make some more decisions on  basic  firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? industrial designer: No Nathan's fine . industrial designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is  component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , project manager:  . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Basically , it's like a  the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .  and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . project manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? industrial designer: I imagine that we could specify . industrial designer: the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips ,  and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case  we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . industrial designer: one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light .  one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . industrial designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . project manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like industrial designer: Yeah .  , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip .  , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . project manager: user interface: industrial designer:  findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer ,  and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? user interface: Interesting question . marketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? project manager:  .  , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table ,  I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on .  , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and  I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know , say our the one marketing: Right . industrial designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation . project manager: Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ? marketing:  It's an option ,  but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now project manager: Okay . project manager: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Did you ? marketing: You waiting for me ? project manager: Fascinating , compelling even .  , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening .  , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional ,  that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface .  the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . user interface: project manager: user interface: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use  natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , industrial designer:  . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface  , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be project manager: Tomatoes . marketing: a different shape industrial designer: user interface: marketing: or okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what  to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing:  not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like  not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like  , leather options or wood options or something industrial designer:  . As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , marketing: So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . industrial designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . project manager: Yeah , it's like , yep industrial designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you , marketing: Very much so . project manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it ? user interface: We can have a duck tape casing . user interface: marketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , project manager: user interface: It could go with the granola crowd . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: Ah , it could be , it could be , project manager: Great , marketing:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise  perceive . Here's a d series of different remote controls industrial designer: user interface: that are out on the market today .  voice recognition , we we  actually have some new  information from our research design team but  I'll get to that in a moment .  , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples ,  and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to  set up a system in which  you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to  with standard responses . Like you could say good morning  remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . project manager: marketing: project manager: industrial designer: user interface: In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line marketing:  . project manager: Lot of single people on the  on the re on the remote control research team user interface: On the remote control industrial designer: project manager: at the user interface: right . user interface: another concept is what  Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with  L_C_ display like on the  iPod project manager:  . user interface:  and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , project manager:  . user interface: And  some special components ,  ideas like  blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children  and  dedicated buttons for for commonly used  channels and even  ideas like secured or hidden programming but  I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . user interface: again probably not what we're going for marketing: user interface: so I  my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod  with a hard cla c  plastic casing marketing: Okay . user interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely  very good ideas .  changeable casings  our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it marketing: right . user interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our  bottom line .  touch screen interface ,  possibly having go-to buttons being  stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels .  , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already project manager:  . user interface: and  the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features  that are around so red for power ,  arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . user interface: And  perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh  for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank marketing: user interface: has jokes when it's ready . project manager: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the  various costs and benefits  I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? marketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places . marketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then project manager: marketing: right ? industrial designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , project manager: To produce each one . marketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? project manager: Well . project manager: There is , it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . marketing: Can we justify it ? project manager: from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift  hundred per cent profit margin  that would mean selling it from twenty five . project manager: So user interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? industrial designer: That's just off the top of my head , project manager: From the board , industrial designer: it is pending further emails . project manager: well marketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for , user interface: marketing:  if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something project manager: That's true ,  industrial designer: It is the new it would be in a class of its own . project manager: And that's to be fair the  the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make  we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros , marketing: Right . project manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . project manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? user interface: I'm thinking that's  definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper  means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the  on the third floor suggested that  marketing: See if we can cut some corners . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . industrial designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on marketing: Right . project manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our  our main selling point here . project manager: So user interface:  I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition marketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition  really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . project manager: if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , user interface: project manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec . user interface: To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , marketing: Price-wise . user interface:  we've we've come up with this , with this new voice marketing: True . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? industrial designer: I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up  but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . marketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . user interface: Does having both really up our costs ? project manager: I can't see how it wouldn't , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . project manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . What which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? marketing: Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But  I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . industrial designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's project manager: What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the  touch screen ? user interface: Well my p is project manager: Nathan ? marketing:  . industrial designer: this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would they're both  they're both gonna push the costs up , but  , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition project manager:  . marketing: And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , project manager:  . So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . marketing: which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option . industrial designer: marketing: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right ? project manager: Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype . industrial designer: Are we going to talk now about  the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? project manager: Yes . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? industrial designer: the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . industrial designer: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to marketing: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement , project manager:  . marketing: like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably industrial designer: It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , marketing: industrial designer: and you know how those those don't really require that much light , user interface: Calculator . industrial designer: but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . project manager: What do you think Ron ? user interface: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . If we're really not  handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little  neat thing that sits on your table or something . industrial designer: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? user interface: Just a thought . industrial designer: What's the  idea ? user interface: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . marketing: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . marketing: True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , project manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . project manager: But that's done , that's no bother  if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like  who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know marketing: project manager: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know  use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know  we can sort that out . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time . user interface: I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things . project manager: Yeah ,  a nice although we do  wh  is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing marketing: Right . project manager: but you could have a very tasteful  wood coloured or earth tone kind of  marketing: That would be kinda neat . And the  the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being  using like a rubber kind of softer feel , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . project manager: something where it's  a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . marketing: Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . user interface: project manager: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . industrial designer: project manager: But to be fair , yeah , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . I guess we'll a that's gonna be  a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay ,  . industrial designer: Sorry about the  lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers marketing: Okay . project manager: We'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a industrial designer: and I'm just having to guess .  , so user interface: project manager: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a  a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be industrial designer: Right . marketing: Take precedence , industrial designer: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can  just incorporate maybe something that folds out marketing: yeah . industrial designer: like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here project manager:  . marketing: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p user interface: Think then we're hitting our cost issue again . project manager: Yeah marketing: True , project manager: we've also got the the me the thing of , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we yeah . project manager: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . project manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on  like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have  a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them marketing: industrial designer: So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ?  project manager: Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the  stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of  rubber for the outside case marketing: Yeah . user interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with  kind of  a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for . That seems to be selling  and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market ,  . project manager: Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . project manager: The  , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth user interface: Sure . industrial designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? project manager:  . industrial designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well  . industrial designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so project manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have  a , you know , a   kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and  , I don't know , olive green or something . project manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . user interface: And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's  colour scheme . project manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on  multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . I want the  I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of  non-remote remote . project manager: And  Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: And also  specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . project manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ? marketing: Cool "

        "Query": "Summarize Marketing's opinions and discussions on the size, design, and functionality of the remote control.",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the size of the remote control, with Marketing suggesting that the TV itself could have a user-friendly remote control system using different technology. However, the Project Manager believed that this idea would not appeal to men and Marketing eventually gave up on it. The group also debated whether installing a new remote would be seen as a technological innovation, with Marketing recommending voice recognition technology due to its fashionable and trendy appeal. The Marketing team emphasized the importance of innovation, considering the use of fruit and vegetable logos and primary colors on the remote control. They also noted that younger people were more interested in features like LCD screens and speech recognition, while older people were willing to spend more money on larger remote controls. Marketing highlighted the volume and channel buttons as the most important and should be easily accessible.",
        "Article": "First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . user interface: project manager: So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did .  do you have a PowerPoint or no ? user interface: Yeah , it's in the should be in the m Project . marketing: Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or user interface: You know you could you could do it yourself actually .  well , the function of a remote control , as what  we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .  some of the considerations is just  for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like  we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . project manager: user interface: And we can decide if that's what we want ,  if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .  and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , project manager: user interface: and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze ,  slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . user interface: And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . user interface: And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete .  , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . Who would like to  follow that one up ? Now , that we've discussed marketing: I can go . marketing: Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us  if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really  there's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . So user interface: And that meaning what ? marketing: Like They like I guess use the buttons a lot . project manager: What do you mean by  the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . marketing: whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex project manager: Oh , right . marketing: and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , project manager:  . marketing: and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , user interface: S marketing: but  they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . project manager: user interface: Wait , is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? marketing: Sh project manager: Could be , yeah . industrial designer: Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? user interface: Like project manager: Oh . marketing:  yeah , that's what my web site said , I user interface: Channel , volume , power . user interface: It's like if you're holding it marketing: I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . marketing: But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . marketing: Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is .  the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . user interface: marketing: And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . project manager: And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? marketing: I guess so , yeah . marketing: Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . project manager: Didn't they  didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it user interface: It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'm just trying to move it .  I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . industrial designer:  okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . industrial designer: We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . user interface: marketing: What exactly is a smart chip ? industrial designer: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . user interface: Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? industrial designer: I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . user interface: industrial designer:  power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . user interface: industrial designer:  a large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . industrial designer: Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system .  smart chip that perverts  that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch .  extra bulb could just be for flashiness ,  subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device .  the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . marketing: So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? industrial designer: This is just like a rough schematic . project manager: So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? marketing: Oh okay . user interface: Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . project manager: The l the light up kind of industrial designer: Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , marketing: Like that we know the battery's working . industrial designer: 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? project manager:  . project manager: Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ? industrial designer: I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons . user interface: Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like  the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? marketing: I think we should . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , project manager:  . Okay , let's talk about all of our We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's  wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . project manager: in States we don't have it , but  it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , user interface: I know . marketing: What is it ? user interface: project manager: it's very  bland looking , it's just text on the screen , user interface: Yeah , project manager: not even user interface: it's like black , black and white kind of project manager: Yeah , just black with just text . industrial designer: You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so user interface: It'll give you the sports . marketing: Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? project manager: Kind of . project manager: So anyway user interface: You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , industrial designer: Seemingly . marketing: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? project manager: Right . project manager: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements . industrial designer: So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? project manager: Yes . project manager: What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about  the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So our target group is You mentioned  older people ? Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? user interface: project manager: Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically user interface: It's gonna make it nicer .  they want something user-friendly , so industrial designer:  well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so we want  for our target group would we say , young and old , all age ranges , all  , not kids obviously , right ? Or kids ? marketing: No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . project manager: Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range marketing: Yeah , I think we need it all . project manager:  what about technic technical  specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? industrial designer: marketing:  I would say we should say dumber than the average person . industrial designer: how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . And we wanna keep  I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . industrial designer: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? user interface: project manager: I think so . user interface: project manager: A finding kind of device or industrial designer: And marketing: I need we we need a like homing device . industrial designer: like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? user interface: Oh right yeah okay . industrial designer: What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . marketing: Do you think people'll really go for that though ? industrial designer: It's useful for the remote phone . project manager: Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? marketing: I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . user interface: Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . user interface: Well , then we could marketing: Do w user interface: If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled  demo demographic . marketing: Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge project manager: You could  we could hook it up . marketing: It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , project manager: Oh . marketing: They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and industrial designer: project manager: And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has user interface: Well marketing: just sitcoms and stuff . user interface: Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , marketing: So user interface: 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , project manager: Right . user interface: whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ? project manager:  . marketing: Wait , on the remote itself ? project manager: user interface: Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . user interface: Well , I don't know , if you can like well project manager: Unless you could say the channel . user interface: I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ? industrial designer: I think people would find that too foreign . project manager: And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . marketing: You definitely need project manager: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so project manager: 'Kay . user interface: And how do we marketing: I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . project manager: We could just have the logo in yellow , user interface: Can't make it entirely project manager: or maybe a yellow light for the keys . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . So we've simplified , we don't need all those  play , fast-forward , rewind , user interface: Right , yeah . project manager: So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down ,  the numbers Yeah . project manager:  can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those user interface: Two examples . project manager: Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? user interface: Oh , it's a Yeah . marketing: Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? project manager: The T_V_ .  how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? user interface: Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . user interface: and so it's like marketing: Yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . project manager: Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , user interface: I don't well , I don't know . user interface: Well , that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . marketing: Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . project manager: That one ? user interface: So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , project manager: Right . user interface: including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now project manager: In the middle perhaps . Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? industrial designer: I had something , but I forgot . After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail .  I'm gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept ,  U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? No ? Okay , well , this meeting is officially over "

        "Summary": "The team had mixed opinions on the remote control design. While Marketing found the basic layout to be dull, they praised the brilliant voice recognition feature. User Interface acknowledged that the remote lacked digits but had all the necessary features. The Industrial Designer reminded everyone that they could only design within their capacity. The Project Manager agreed that the remote was of high quality but had low acceptance. \n\nIn terms of the battery design, the team wanted it to be long-lasting, original, and conventional to ensure innovation, versatility, and durability. They also wanted to avoid deviating too far from the usual performance to prevent issues for new users. \n\nUser Interface suggested using a rubber cover that could stretch over the remote, and the Project Manager agreed, asking the Industrial Designer to explore this idea further.",
        "Article": " it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock .  okay our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations  and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different  functions of it . And s  in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials  and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . The case ,  the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do ,  there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic .  buttons , for buttons we have  pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , project manager:  . industrial designer: which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen .  circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are .  we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of  using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . Or a solar battery , although there are slight  complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . industrial designer: Or  something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you .  personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything project manager:  . industrial designer: any ideas on that ?  I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll  buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . project manager: industrial designer: But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down .  we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down .  I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . marketing: Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ? industrial designer: I'm not sure . marketing: 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve industrial designer: This is what I'm sort of marketing: and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , I wonder industrial designer: I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . But the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . project manager:  just a real quick question  the weight of these different elements , have you industrial designer: Yeah , n project manager: no idea , okay .  I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , project manager: industrial designer: and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , project manager: industrial designer:  but other than project manager: industrial designer: that's really basic , that's all I have gotten so far . industrial designer: I have save this in the  shared projects , if anyone wants to look project manager: Thank you , perfect . industrial designer: and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . project manager:  if you made notes yourself you can put those on our  underneath our oh ,  in your book , industrial designer: Just in my notebook , project manager: then don't worry about that . industrial designer: but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . Alright ?  I guess I can project manager: 'Kay now we're  concepts concepts of user interface . user interface: Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device .  we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . We have a number of different choices for a design concept  and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of  , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , industrial designer: user interface: how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device .  once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and  the extra functions and the more advanced features . industrial designer: user interface: So basically , marketing: user interface: that's what we don't want .  you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen .  you can just about make out  that the button three buttons are  previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time .  then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often .  most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored .  other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ ,  I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ .  you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow .  and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or  have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . user interface: And that would allow you to access access the advanced features  whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . industrial designer: So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? user interface: I think that's that's one way to go , yes . user interface:   there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . user interface: There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're I industrial designer: Right user interface: well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device .  it would also have to have  a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , project manager: user interface: but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control .  a bit like a bit like how they have these  digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up . project manager: I do think that  one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . project manager: like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's  you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . industrial designer: Well Are you are you tak project manager: Like I I know I use that often enough . marketing: Wait , but is that separate from what he was saying ? project manager: Well industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a industrial designer: No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , user interface: But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c  communication is one way , project manager: user interface: so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . marketing: Should I plug that in ? project manager: marketing: user interface: Is that going on ? Okay . marketing: Is it on ? Ri What F_ do you have to press , project manager: Eight . Basically , I was given  an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . project manager: marketing: So first  they had people they ranked  the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , industrial designer: Okay . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun ,  in a year , so user interface: marketing: even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . industrial designer: marketing: Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . user interface: industrial designer: That there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: that pretty much sums it up . marketing: Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ? project manager:  do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ?  how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or  or the spongy material at all ? user interface: project manager: Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? It would be easier on the hands . industrial designer: If it's latex if it's latexy project manager: It's kind of and then it industrial designer: mean project manager: we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , user interface: A kind of thing that project manager: I dunno . But industrial designer: An  I if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , project manager: industrial designer: but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . It's there's something to be said ,  we we got that thing earlier from you about  not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: Yeah , so something , m m instead of a necess industrial designer: something grippable ,  we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . marketing: yeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , user interface: Yeah . marketing: you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , industrial designer: marketing: like I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called . industrial designer: Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable . could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them , project manager: F for sure , or maybe like marketing: industrial designer: li project manager:  couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . project manager: Could they be smelly ? user interface: I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ?  like  I dunno , like  carrots or something . marketing: project manager: Or carrot shaped , industrial designer: it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot project manager:  . industrial designer: isn't it ? user interface: Maybe , project manager: Like large button , industrial designer: Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . marketing: What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . project manager: would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ? marketing: Just to tie it in a little . When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? Or your fingers ? marketing: Yeah . Maybe industrial designer: I user interface: Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb . project manager: Don't you think ? industrial designer: No marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: just thumb-sized . industrial designer: Jus project manager: But  in order to get to all of them , marketing: But I like i project manager: you know . user interface: But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps . I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . user interface: So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . user interface: and And you find that works quite well ? marketing: I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . user interface: Is that marketing: 'Cause th user interface: The button on an iPod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ? marketing: It's like five , project manager: It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel . industrial designer: yeah , it would  each version of it has been a little bit different , project manager: The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think . industrial designer: but Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . marketing: I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . marketing: Like just the idea of like those industrial designer:   marketing: so few buttons for main things , industrial designer: t marketing: but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . marketing: 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Yeah , I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ industrial designer: Right . industrial designer:  project manager: Okay  we have we've about fifteen minutes left , industrial designer: Oh we probably have to get going , don't we ? project manager: so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation .  I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all industrial designer: 'Kay .  industrial designer: Could Could we  could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , marketing: If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . project manager: Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex industrial designer: Exactly . user interface: I think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . user interface: So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside . marketing: Lemons ? industrial designer: user interface: project manager: Okay ,  marketing: project manager: components concept . project manager: G industrial designer: Right , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary but  project manager: That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . So can you just explain what that is real quick ? industrial designer: Alright , so  decisions , what the okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . industrial designer:  I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? project manager: I think it's awesome . user interface: Yeah ,  I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the  how reliable it is , industrial designer: Right , I haven't gotten any user interface: but as far as I know , the technology is good . industrial designer: yeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but  but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think . They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . project manager: industrial designer: I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done . But I don't know any decisions on marketing: project manager: If they're if they're really options . industrial designer: I did f user interface: Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think .  oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got .  , 'kay , the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? user interface:  I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . user interface:  but project manager: but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . 'Cause you don't have control over numbers user interface: I don't think it would really work . marketing: Yeah , it's a project manager: or industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . industrial designer: th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . marketing: But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be user interface: Yeah . marketing: and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . marketing: And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . project manager: So , have a scroll for volume ? industrial designer: F or for all those secret functions ? project manager: F industrial designer: When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . user interface: I think yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later . project manager: I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide  whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . industrial designer:  I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . project manager: I'm a little  I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . project manager:  marketing: Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ? industrial designer:  yeah , everything I've project manager: Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . industrial designer: N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's  like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . industrial designer: Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , project manager: Ge o industrial designer: I think that that's done for us . Okay  let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . industrial designer: Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ? project manager: Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ? marketing: I'm thinking curved of some sort . industrial designer: We don't really know what the difference project manager:  okay , interface , the type and the supplements . So push or scroll , user interface:  project manager: right ? Or both ? user interface: Yep .  And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . user interface: So in terms of  in terms of  economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . And if we had a sc an on-screen  kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno . I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case user interface: Yeah . project manager: Is that okay with you ? industrial designer: because project manager: How you feeling ? marketing: Yeah .  I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , project manager: marketing: but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . project manager: Okay , so we're gonna go with  type pushbuttons , and then supplements , user interface: Yep . project manager: how are we gonna do that ? user interface:  what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? project manager:  I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the  the additional buttons we can use . user interface:  project manager: So we're gonna have like a menu button , industrial designer: Oh . project manager: Okay ,  so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . user interface:  in industrial designer: So what are what are our buttons gonna be ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So like one through five , or user interface: Yeah , yeah marketing: Like a radio type sorta situation ? user interface: about yeah like yeah , a bit like radio presets .  project manager: Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need  numbers one through zero , right ? user interface:  we wouldn't even need the numbers . project manager: Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . user interface: and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , industrial designer: Yeah , up down .  our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , industrial designer: project manager:  you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . project manager:  did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ? industrial designer: Simple chip "

        "Query": "What are the potential difficulties for researcher collaborations and networks after Brexit? How does the loss of funds due to leaving the European Union impact these collaborations and what are the possible solutions?",
        "Summary": "The impact of the Brexit deal on collaborations is still uncertain, particularly in relation to playing a role in Horizon Europe. Maintaining quality, impact, and growth in capacity is crucial for Wales. Dr. David Blaney believes that these efforts have already yielded positive results, such as increased research funding and a stronger presence in the international research market. However, the main challenge lies in securing sufficient funding. While the government recently allocated an additional \u00a36.6 million for research, this is not sustainable or adequate. The Welsh government has also expressed its vision for research and innovation, emphasizing the need for more investment in the Welsh research base to enhance competitiveness in accessing funding at a UK level.",
        "Article": "gareth rogers: Good morning, and welcome to today's meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. Unfortunately, the Chair is unable to attend today, so in accordance with Standing Order 17.22 I call for nominations for a temporary Chair for the duration of today's meeting. gareth rogers: As there's only one nomination, I declare that John Griffiths has been appointed as temporary Chair. Thank you all very much, and item 1 on our agenda today is introductions, apologies, substitutions and declarations of interest. We will move on then to item 2, and our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, and our first evidence session. I'm very pleased to welcome the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales here today, and Dr David Blaney as chief executive, and Bethan Owen, director of institutional engagement. I wondered if we could start off with you telling us what evidence you can see that the Brexit process has had any impact on Welsh higher education so far. dr david blaney: Can I preface the response by just reminding you that we are, by contract and by role, apolitical, and a lot of the judgments about the impact of Brexit essentially reflect where people sit politically in terms of whether they think it's a good thing or a bad thing? We're not going to go there, obviously, today, so we'll stick to the facts as we can see them, and hopefully we'll be able to help you, but there are areas where we are unable to help. But even in terms of your assessment of whether this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing, a good impact or a bad impact, some of that inevitably in the end becomes a matter of your politics on it, so we will be as careful as we can be on that. In terms of the impact of Brexit on higher education, clearly, the significance here is about the contribution that higher education can make to Wales. So, we fund provision; we don't fund providers, technically, although obviously there's not much provision without providers. So, we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers, but fundamentally the issue is: what does the HE system in Wales do for Wales, and what impact might Brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for Wales? So, we know that universities make annually about \u00a35 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And that, I think, just reflects the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that\u2014that's anecdotal\u2014but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult. In terms of the financial impact of that, clearly, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of the money\u2014we're almost immediately straight into politics if you're not careful\u2014but some of the money will be available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. It's not necessarily the case that Wales will always lose out in that relationship, but that will become a matter of politics. There's a broader dimension, which is about the economic impact of Brexit on the UK economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen.\u00a0We can touch later on on the extent to which they are sighted on\u00a0this and preparing for it. bethan owen: This is based on the UCAS\u00a0applications and the report that was published at the end of June, 30 June.\u00a0The European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales have decreased by 8\u00a0per cent, which contrasts with a 2\u00a0per cent increase for English institutions, and non-EU\u2014so international students, not from Europe\u2014have also decreased by 9\u00a0per cent to Welsh institutions, again contrasting with a 7\u00a0per cent increase in England. Could I then just ask you what you see as the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector at the moment? bethan owen: The funding position would be the main pressure. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of being implemented, and the changes to the student finance arrangements will take effect from this September. However, the recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer. That funding, when it returns to institutions, is intended to re-establish funding for higher cost provision, both full time and part time; reinstate funding for innovation; and maintain, at the very least, the research funding in real terms. Universities, in the meantime,\u00a0are trying to minimise the cost reductions that they're making in order to maintain the infrastructure, so that when the funding comes they can get the best value out of it. For the research and teaching grant, though, we are still funding at a lower level\u2014\u00a312.5 million less\u2014then the starting point for the Diamond report, the 2015-16 starting report.\u00a0But we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond. And it's probably important to note that the Diamond recommendations predated Brexit, therefore the challenges introduced by Brexit are in addition to those that the Diamond report was addressing. There is also the start of a reduction, both in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Wales. And the other pressures include pay and pension costs, not least the issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, where there's potentially a significant increase in cost. Increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure bring a requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing, which bring their own pressures. And finally, the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding\u2014the Augar review. john griffiths am: In terms of European Union students and enrolment, is Wales forecast to do less well than England and, if so, why might that be? bethan owen: They are not forecasting it. It's very difficult until the enrolments are made, and it's also very hard to see\u2014the data that we see is the UCAS\u00a0data. So, now, they have to find the full fee, whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as\u00a0Welsh students. So, I'm speculating that that might be having an impact as well on EU students' appetite to come. llyr gruffydd am: Well, that's straight into what I was going to ask, really, about what you think the factors are that led to this 8 per cent or 9 per cent drop in EU students applying to study in Wales, where we see a 2 per cent increase in England. Is that it, or are there other things that you've taken into account? What's your assessment of the reasons behind this? dr david blaney: It's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons, but I think there are probably two. The one that Bethan has already indicated, which is the change in student support arrangements for EU students, will have\u00a0an effect of perturbation.\u00a0That's probably relatively temporary\u2014let's hope it is\u2014as that settles down because, actually, the deal for EU students coming into Wales is no worse than that coming into England. Ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower, but we do struggle in Wales in terms of the\u00a0Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. The other dimension is that when you're in a highly competitive recruitment market, you have to do what you can to look attractive. Part of that is about being able to invest in facilities, and\u00a0particularly buildings and kit, and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that. Certainly, anecdotally I know, from my own family, that a lot of the choices have been made in terms of the state of repair of campuses and so on. There's something rational about that, isn't there? If you've got a system that is relatively better invested, then you're likely to have a better student experience because the resources are likely to be better. We saw a sort of similar but opposite effect when the \u00a39,000 fee maximum limit came in, and some institutions, mostly in England\u2014there was one in Wales\u2014chose to pitch their fee levels really quite low, relative to that \u00a39,000, and caught a cold in the student recruitment market because fee levels denote quality in the student mind.\u00a0So, the price sensitivities work quite differently. So, again, if you've got a relatively better invested part of the system, then that might well be one of the reasons why it looks more attractive. llyr gruffydd am: That latter factor would affect the whole of the cohort, not just the international recruitment, of course. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to that because that's re-balancing where the policy of investment goes. mark reckless am: If I heard you correctly earlier, you said that the applications from non-EU students were also down by 8 per cent or 9 per cent. So, forgive me a certain scepticism\u00a0about the explanation of the fall in the EU students being that they did get the fee grant and now they do not. If that's the explanation, why are we seeing the same fall in non-EU applications? dr david blaney: Well, I think the Welsh domiciled are also now having to face the prospect of finding a loan for the whole of the fee. There's also a demographic dimension here with the downturn in the 18-year-old school-leaver profile, and that actually is happening in Wales at a slightly later point than in England. mark reckless am: But this is non-EU students, and I think you said, Bethan, an 8 per cent or 9 per cent fall in them as well. mark reckless am: All English or all Welsh? bethan owen: Well, I contrasted the Welsh position with the English position where they were seeing growth. If you look, then\u2014and we don't have the detailed information, but, again, what UCAS publish is some analysis by tariff. They analyse by type of institution\u2014in other words, the grades that you need to get into institutions\u2014and there is a trend for growth being in the higher tariff institutions. So, there's a mix effect in there as well, and I think there's undoubtedly an element of perception of how welcome overseas and international students are, and that's something that we know the sector are working on with Government. mark reckless am: Why would that affect Wales\u00a0more than England? Do you think there's been perhaps too great a negativity about Brexit in the sector? bethan owen: I think it's the mix of institutions that we have. When we look at the mix of institutions that we have, we will probably see a differential impact between Cardiff University and others. john griffiths am: Okay, Mark? Sorry, David, did you want to add anything? dr david blaney: I was just going to say that we would expect to see quite differential performance in the English sector, so the overall numbers are being brought up by substantial increased performance with some of that sector, and it's a question of how many of that type of institution you have in Wales. mark reckless am: So, performance is increasing amongst the English universities, but not amongst the Welsh, you think. dr david blaney: I think performance is increasing, but increasing substantially with some of the English sector, not all of it. So, you get an average for the sector that is increased performance, but actually the stronger players within that sector, with the stronger international profiles, are bringing that up, and we have fewer in Wales that have that sort of presence. darren millar am: Would it be fair to say, then, that the universities over the border in England are better at selling themselves internationally than our Welsh institutions? Or is it just this fact that we've got fewer very high tariff universities versus the English market? dr david blaney: I suspect, and this is speculation\u2014I suspect that it's a bit of both. I would then come back to the point I was making about the Anglocentric nature of the UK media. darren millar am: But, forgive me, don't international students just look at the UK as a whole? How are we comparing to Scotland, for example, or Northern Ireland, in terms of their universities? Do you have a comparative figure for Scottish universities? bethan owen: I haven't got that one with me for now, but there will be one in the data. bethan owen: Again, it's a combination of being part of the UK but differentiating, and the ability to differentiate the strengths of Wales, so attracting those students to Wales specifically, on top of the UK draw. dr david blaney: So, in terms of the efforts that have been made, there's a programme now that is being run by the sector in Wales\u2014it's 'Study in Wales'. But that is a determined collective effort to present Wales as a good place to study, with particular messages about what distinguishes studying in Wales from studying more broadly in the UK. In a sense, that is responding to the need to increase the presence of Wales in an international market. It will take a while to actually have an impact, but I think that's exactly the sort of work the sector need to be doing more of. mark reckless am: What are those messages on why prospective students should study in Wales? dr david blaney: One of them in particular is relative safety. We know that one of the considerations, particularly for parents of overseas students, is are they going to go to a safe environment, and we know that the perception of international students who study in Wales is that this is a comfortable and safe place to be. That's partly a function of the size of our larger cities\u2014quite a lot smaller than many of the cities in England. So, we've got a UK-quality system, a UK degree, and the strength of that brand is available in Wales, but it's available in a way that is safer and more supportive, I think is the messaging that's coming through. darren millar am: I just wonder to what extent you have been able to plan in your financial forecasts for the next few years ahead for the potential impacts of Brexit. What have you built in, if anything? bethan owen: In terms of our funding, we receive our funding annually, but the sector provides us with financial forecasts, and we use those for monitoring sustainability. We are due to receive a full forecast at the end of this month, and we obviously have updated information from institutions. darren millar am: And they're three-year forecasts that come through to you, aren't they? bethan owen: They are four plus the current year.\u00a0So, we've got numbers to 2019-20 at the moment, and expect to go to 2020-21. darren millar am: And what are the universities expecting? What do they anticipate? bethan owen: Well, for 2017-18, which is the year we're about to end now, they were expecting \u00a338 million income from European students, and approximately \u00a391 million from the various European programme funding sources, and that's about 8 per cent of the total income\u2014\u00a31.5 billion\u2014of the sector. The forecasts are assuming that that continues, albeit that institutions\u00a0have various scenarios that they have for all sorts of scenarios that we can all speculate on, and, as I mentioned earlier, the balancing act of maintaining infrastructure and\u00a0resources and staff in the short term is where we are at the moment, or where the sector is at the moment. And there are also signs that the banks and lending institutions are becoming a bit more risk-averse in providing borrowing to institutions, and of more differentiation between individual institutions being made than has possibly been the case in the past. The sector made an operating deficit, again looking at all Welsh institutions collectively last year, 2016-17, of \u00a317 million. And we're expecting a similar collective level of deficit for this financial year, if not slightly higher. Now, these are managed deficits and we are not currently seeing critical short-term cash availability issues in the\u00a0sector. However, the increase in funding from Diamond is a key part of enabling the sector to return to longer-term financial sustainability. You can manage in the short-term, but there comes a point when the big cost reductions and\u00a0infrastructure reductions have to be made. And, again, having mentioned the pressures on pay, pensions and other challenges, it is difficult to gauge whether, if those factors come into play as well, some of these cost reductions may have to be made before funding comes in to replace\u2014either Diamond\u00a0funding or the European replacement funding. darren millar am: So, would it be fair to say that, in terms of the funding arrangements, and, in terms of the student numbers, one reason why we've got this recruitment\u00a0problem is this lack of investment in the capital infrastructure that we've\u00a0seen in recent years because of the\u00a0financing arrangements from the Welsh Government, and the fee regime that we had previously, and\u00a0the student finance regime that we had previously, not getting more cash into our Welsh universities perhaps, and that, over the next few years, there's going to have to be much more significant investment in capital if we're to raise the game and be more competitive, yes? bethan owen: Yes, that would be fair to say. darren millar am: So, to what extent are they planning for more capital investment\u00a0in those financial strategies that they've been preparing and presenting to you? bethan owen: They are all planning for capital investment. This year, 2018-19, is the first time that we've had capital funding in our remit letter\u2014so, we've got \u00a310 million of capital funding, which is very welcome, with a prospect of a further \u00a320 million. That will make a difference, particularly\u00a0to those institutions who are not finding it as easy to borrow from financial institutions. However, there are internal governance processes that are putting tight restrictions and\u00a0expectations of what that money will be invested in. But they all have plans to do it and they\u00a0need the confidence that their forecasts and long-term future funding prospects are secure enough that they can get the confidence of borrowers then, and service the costs of those borrowers. What clarity is there from the Welsh Government at the moment in terms of how much they anticipate the Diamond dividend will be, and what proportion of that\u00a0is going to be released to HEIs in the future? bethan owen: I was very carefully not describing it as a dividend\u2014a re-establishing of funding that we had in the past for higher cost and innovation and maintaining research funding. The timescales are difficult, because we have an annual remit letter, and we can work with Welsh Government officials, and they can only give us a sense of when they think the funding will be released. But 2018-19 is\u00a0the start of the system, and because of cohort protection\u2014so, protecting those students who came in on a different deal to the deal from 2018-19\u2014in the early years there is an element of double cost; there's a cost of seeing out the old system and the different cost of implementing the new system. So, at the moment, we're certainly not in a position to tell the sector with any degree of certainty what funding would be beyond what we've allocated for 2018-19, with some sense of what 2019-20 numbers we're working with because we allocate our money over an academic year\u2014so, by definition, we've already made assumptions of four months of the 2019-20 funding, albeit that's not approved yet in the budgetary process. darren millar am: But you're not being given a steer at all as to what you expect the additional resource that you might have to make available to Welsh universities might be as a result of Diamond. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say that officials have been as helpful as they can be with us, in terms of the planning assumptions we make and indications about whether or not we are being too ambitious or not ambitious enough. So, I think they're being very helpful; as Bethan said, they're constrained by the process\u2014they can't pre-empt a budget process. The other question I think you asked was how much of the money released by the new arrangements will come into higher education. At the moment, we are expecting all of it to come into higher education, as the product of the arrangement between the current Cabinet Secretary and the current First Minister. The extent to which any changes there cause that to come under threat is something I can't judge at the moment. But we have had in our remit letter from the Cabinet Secretary a clear indication that we can expect our resource to grow over the next few years, as the Diamond process unfolds. llyr gruffydd am: Bethan said in an earlier answer that, I think, the financial forecasting from universities forecast something pretty consistent in terms of what they're hoping to be\u00a0receiving in income, for example. So, does that tally, really, or are they going to be recruiting additional students from the UK market or\u2014? What's the plan? bethan owen: I was\u00a0reflecting on the last point when we had consistent information across the sector. bethan owen: I'm expecting that the forecast that we get at the end of this month will reflect the reduced applications we've seen, and an element of that will be reflected in reduced improvements\u00a0as well. So, we don't really know, then, whether\u2014it's unlikely that they are going to expect a consistent fee income, really. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say we would expect them to respond to what they're seeing in the UCAS process. Even if they didn't, they would all, in any case, have sensitivities for what they would do if things don't come out in the way they hope. And if they didn't have that then we would be on their case, of course, because we want them to be properly sighted. darren millar am: Can I just ask, in terms of the impact of Brexit, have you done any assessment of what you think might happen, or have any of the institutions made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions, going forward? You've mentioned scenarios earlier on, David, so what scenarios have you set out? dr david blaney: There's a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, which is chaired by one of the Government directors, and we sit on that. And we have provided that group with early summaries of the risks and the potential impact, in terms of the exposure of the sector to EU-sourced funding. We have, as part of that working group, explored those issues that it would be really very helpful for either the Welsh Government to try to put in place or for the Welsh Government to persuade UK Government to do.\u00a0And I think, in our submission,\u00a0we identified\u00a0a number of areas of what we would consider to be a helpful action, and that has been worked through that working group. We know that it has informed Welsh Government's position, in terms of what it does and also in terms of the conversations that they have with\u00a0Her Majesty's Government. Beyond that, what we haven't done in that working group is share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would\u00a0respond to different scenarios. We are not able to do that here either because, inevitably, they would have varying\u00a0degrees of unpalatability and they would have to be managed very, very carefully. You take cost out, which is essentially the response, you actually take people's\u00a0jobs out, and all of that\u00a0has to be managed carefully. So, that's not really a matter for public consideration, but we do know\u00a0that the institutions\u00a0are looking at a range of scenarios on what they\u00a0would do. Bethan mentioned earlier\u00a0on that the\u00a0current deficit for the sector is a managed deficit\u2014it's not something that has taken\u00a0them by surprise. They are responding to what they\u00a0see as the dip between where Diamond was reporting and where the money starts flowing. Similarly, I think we're comfortable\u00a0that there is a managed approach\u00a0to the scenarios that they're testing within institutions. The bigger issue really, in a public policy context, is the potential damage for the sector to be able to deliver for Wales in terms of research and skills development\u00a0and all the other contributions. darren millar am: So, you're confident that they're taking a robust approach\u00a0to planning\u00a0for various scenarios, going forward, are you, as individual HEIs? dr david blaney: Yes, and as the deal becomes more clear politically, then they will obviously have greater\u00a0clarity in terms of which of these scenarios\u00a0they need to work up more fully, but they are sighted on it. Can I just ask about fee and access plans, and how Brexit might impact them? To what extent\u00a0do you think that they\u00a0could be impacted? dr david blaney: I think there are two dimensions to maybe touch upon there. So, we're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year. We, as part of that process, go through similar\u2014we look at their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts\u2014data to the stuff we've just been discussing. And\u00a0also, of course, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types, from different domains, are going to be recruited. So, clearly, if there is a continuing downward pressure on EU student recruitment, then that will reduce the amount of fee income that's going to come in, unless they can find other students, and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans. If institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality, then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan. If it's not fundamentally different, but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later\u2014. We also monitor after the event and, if there are differences, we would then obviously require institutions to explain those differences. Conversely, if they'd had more students, and potentially more investment, we'd want to know what they'd spent it on, and if they've done different things, we'd want to understand that as well. The only other thing that's perhaps worth saying is that, in the 2019-20 fee and access plans\u2014they're not published yet, so I can't give you the full detail\u2014five universities have made reference to Brexit and the Brexit impact, and things they want to do through their fee and access plan to try and address some of those issues, so they're in there as well. darren millar am: But we've already said, haven't we, that it may be nothing to do with Brexit, this dip in EU recruitment, because there are other factors like the attractiveness of the estates and the environment that young people might be educated in? But they're making assumptions that it's linked to Brexit, are they? dr david blaney: Not really. There are things they want to do to enhance and to protect\u00a0student mobility, and some of that will be funded through fee plan investment. So, the Brexit conversation between the EU and the UK Government might or might not sustain\u00a0Erasmus engagement, and if it doesn't, then they need to find other ways of trying to support that sort of thing. What else do you do to assure yourselves that Welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning\u00a0for Brexit? bethan owen: We've touched on contingency plans, but, in an environment\u00a0of uncertainty, I think it's difficult for any of us to know what the right scenario is. I think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios, what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding. So, we touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales, so more focus on marketing Wales overseas, but also within the UK. The other area where the sector is working at a UK level very hard is making the arguments to UK Government for maintaining access to the successor to Horizon 2020, which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructure\u2014students is one part, but the whole funding infrastructure\u00a0for maintaining research capacity. So, working with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions\u00a0are doing. That group, which is the Welsh Government\u00a0group, is being advised by members on it, and that's informing Welsh Government officials when they engage with UK Government\u00a0as well. mark reckless am: Do universities seek your advice on what the risks and, indeed, opportunities of Brexit may be and what you think they should be doing to plan for them, or is your role more one of monitoring what they do as opposed to advising what they should do? bethan owen: They are autonomous institutions and ultimately\u00a0their governing bodies are responsible\u00a0for ensuring their sustainability. It's not a relationship\u00a0where we would advise and direct, but it is a relationship\u00a0where we would question the scenarios if we consider from our experience that we would have expected other scenarios to have been tested. mark reckless am: I understand you don't direct, of course, but my question was about advising. You're overseeing, or monitoring\u2014or whatever you like to describe the role as\u2014quite a number of institutions, and presumably you therefore have particular expertise within your organisation, and I just wondered whether higher education institutions are doing enough to draw on that. bethan owen: I think we can advise\u2014we can advise based on data and information that we can see. The big thing in this whole\u00a0Brexit scenario is the uncertainty and the extent to which our speculation is better informed than the governing bodies or the sector collectively is probably the issue. So, there's a relationship\u00a0with the sector and there's a relationship with individual institutions, and they are different. So, some of these conversations are happening in various ways, where we're all gaining intelligence about what might be a sensible set of planning assumptions. Then, if we see an institution that is manifestly giving signs of not being sighted on some of these risks, either through their forecast or through other assurance\u00a0activity, we will challenge. We have an annual cycle, with two points in the year where we reassess the overall risks of individual\u00a0institutions, and that's based on a whole range of hard data but also a range of soft data. We have lots of conversations and we take all of that in the round and form an assessment about the financial sustainability of the institutions but also the extent to which we think their governance and management arrangements are properly sighted and facing properly the challenges that they face. In some ways, we say it's not about the challenges they face; it's about how they face the challenges. Our alarm bells really ring when we get the sense that, actually, either an executive or a governing body hasn't really noticed. There are medium-term real challenges, both because of Brexit and because of other contextual factors, but at the moment the sector is a managed sector, which is good. It's not always like that, but we're in, I think, a good place at the moment. So, our role is definitely to challenge where we don't think they are making sensible assessments, but it's not to say that their assessment is wrong and ours is right; it's just to have a conversation\u00a0about, 'Why have you done this and what has informed your thinking?' It's slightly more one step back and slightly more subtle, but it is, as you imply, us using the intelligence we gain from all of those conversations when we talk to individual institutions as well. We had evidence last week from some of the higher education institutions, including Cardiff University, and it's very interesting, in relation to Erasmus+ and the mobility funding for students that, I think, only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in Cardiff is paid for by Erasmus+. I note that you've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator. I was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments\u00a0to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that. bethan owen: Again, reflecting on the latest fee and access plans, seven of the universities are referring to mobility\u2014either they have targets in them or are explaining what their plans are\u2014so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income. However, Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan\u2014if we were looking at a scenario where that infrastructure wasn't available, to implement anything similar to that would be much less efficient and much more costly. Ideally, you'd want something that all Welsh institutions could take part in, and that takes some investment and some co-ordinating. I think it's easy to underestimate the accumulation of time that has gone into establishing Erasmus. llyr gruffydd am: And the point was made clearly last week that the brand is internationally recognised. When you enter into Erasmus+, you know exactly what you're going to get, and all of that. But there have been criticisms as well about degrees of flexibility and this, that and the other, so I'm just wondering whether\u2014and there is presumably going to be some change on that front although I'm hoping we can buy into it, as others have done who aren't in the EU\u2014that emphasis on encouraging institutions to look more proactively at funding their own mobility efforts would be positive. dr david blaney: I think the\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Sorry\u2014especially if it means that they do more of it. I think the Welsh sector is definitely committed to trying to find ways of promoting and resourcing that sort of mobility. There are signs that some of the restrictive elements of the Erasmus programme are going to change anyway, because that's under development and that's positive. There have been positive noises as part of the Brexit negotiations about wanting to carry on being able to access the Erasmus programme. Nothing is agreed until it's all agreed apparently, so we'll have to see on that one. That would be far better, I think, as Bethan indicates, than trying to replace it with a made-in-Wales only, but you could have a made-in-Wales on top. All of these challenges also create opportunities because they stimulate thinking, and so the fact that seven of the eight universities\u00a0are already now using their fee plans as a vehicle for thinking about this is positive, and I think we can take that on from there. llyr gruffydd am: Because that 40/60 split struck me as being the opposite to what I perceived\u00a0the situation to be. A key\u00a0part of your role is to work in partnership with students, so I'd just like to ask what work have you done with students, in terms of maybe protecting their interests as the Brexit scenario evolves? dr david blaney: Well, as you say, we do work with students. We were the first of the funding councils\u00a0in the UK to have a memorandum\u00a0of understanding\u00a0with the National Union of Students in Wales. So, we have close links with NUS Wales and we're very proud of that, and it's very productive. We we're, again, ahead of the rest of the UK in requiring all HE providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter. The UK-wide quality code also has elements in it where arrangements have to be specified about the protection of student interests. That is particularly, in essence, around circumstances where a provider gets into difficulties and they might wish to close a course or something more drastic and then what arrangements are in place to make sure that those students who are in train are protected. So, that is there and we've worked hard with the sector and with NUS Wales to get those measures in place. There's more development work in train at the moment, so we've asked Universities Wales to construct a protection that takes account of the approach to protecting the student\u00a0interests in higher education. We're also requiring\u00a0further education institutions\u00a0who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same, and that's very important. The students who are HE students in FE are absolutely not second-best, and they should have the same protections. llyr gruffydd am: But is all this a general piece of work? It's not Brexit-specific, although, no doubt, it may\u2014. The other dimension around Brexit is the immigration status of EU students, and that's, kind of, beyond our pay scale\u2014that's a UK Government issue. llyr gruffydd am: Is that something that you have a view on? dr david blaney: It's clearly in the interest of the enrichment of the curriculum\u00a0and the student experience for students in Welsh institutions to be able to have students from other EU countries\u00a0in the mix. Now, of course, you have a statutory duty as well to assess the academic quality of the work in our higher education institutions, and I'm\u00a0just wondering\u00a0what potential impacts you think that Brexit might have on that particular aspect. dr david blaney: I think there are possibly\u00a0a couple of things to say, and one, in a sense, echoes what I was just saying in the final part of my previous response, which is that part of the quality of the student experience\u00a0is the richness that you get from having students in your cohort who have different backgrounds and different perspectives. So, if there is a continuing\u00a0reduction in the number of EU students coming into Welsh institutions, then that richness deteriorates. That doesn't\u00a0mean to say that the base or the threshold standard of what's required for a degree will come under pressure, it's just about the richness on top\u00a0of that, which will be, in a sense, a quality-enhancement issue. That would be something that we would wish to try to protect against, but in the end you can't force EU students to come\u2014you have to try and look attractive, and we've touched on that. The baseline requirement assessment\u00a0of quality will not be affected by Brexit, except in so far as the machinery we use to discharge\u00a0our statutory responsibility, which is through the Quality Assurance Agency, which themselves\u00a0are accredited\u00a0with\u00a0European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, the European machinery\u00a0for higher education quality. And there's a set of standards around that, and we would obviously wish not to be in a position where our ability to use and adhere to those standards is adversely\u00a0impacted upon. Those\u00a0standards will still exist, and it will be possible for the British system to adhere to them, even if they're not actually able to play in the same way. Then the only other thing I would\u00a0say is that one of the factors that can cause\u00a0the quality of the learning and teaching experience to be likely to become inadequate is when institutions come under financial pressure, just because their capacity to maintain the same sort of student experience can get under pressure. So, clearly, we will be looking for and making sure that institutions manage the financial pressures, if there are any\u2014and there are some at the moment, as we've described\u2014and manage those carefully. And in all of that, we will expect institutions to do their duty to make sure that the commitments they've already made to students are carried through. So, where students have already started on the course, they need to be able to finish that course\u2014you can't just pull the plug out. A lot of what you've told us in the last three quarters of an hour or so will have costs attached, depending on the impacts. Certainly, we're in choppy waters as a sector anyway, and the risk is that things will be even more choppy, if you'll excuse that level of political interpretation, over the years to come. I'm just wondering what advice you might have given the Welsh Government in terms of what level of transition funding, or Brexit transition funding, might be required by the sector, and if you have, what the Welsh Government might have told you. bethan owen: I mentioned earlier that, obviously, we've provided information in terms of the assumptions that the sector are making on income. I think the extent to which that needs to be replaced or supported with transition funding depends absolutely on what the final arrangements for Brexit are, but it's an appropriate point to refer to the report that Professor Graeme\u00a0Reid has produced, commissioned by Welsh Government. But, again, the Reid recommendations in that report build on the Diamond recommendations, and as soon as\u00a0Diamond is in place\u2014and Reid is providing recommendations in addition, to establish funding on the basis that the funding needs to be available in Wales to maintain and develop and strengthen the research and innovation infrastructure that we have. llyr gruffydd am: Are you not worried, though, that the clock is ticking and that we really don't know what the situation is at this point? dr david blaney: Do you mean the Brexit situation? llyr gruffydd am: The Brexit clock, yes. dr david blaney: Uncertainty is unhelpful, because as I've said several times, the sector is a managed sector at the moment. We're not seeing maverick stuff, but actually you can only manage, really, what you can see and what you can reasonably predict. So, the longer the uncertainty persists, the more difficult that is for institutional management and, indeed, for the rest of the machinery to support them. darren millar am: Chair, can I just ask a question? john griffiths am: Yes, Darren. darren millar am: In terms of uncertainty, though, we've still got this uncertainty over whether the extra cash that the Government's going to have to spend as a result of Diamond being implemented is coming to the HE sector. They've given a political commitment, but you've got absolutely no other assurance of the sums of money that are coming in. We've got the reform of tertiary education arrangements in Wales, which are also under way, so it's a bit of a perfect storm for you, isn't it, really, with all of these three things happening at the same time? dr david blaney: We're certainly kept busy. darren millar am: But two of those things are in the gift of the Welsh Government to sort out for you, aren't they? dr david blaney: Well, the policy on the reform of the post-compulsory sector absolutely is a Welsh Government policy. The extent to which they can pre-empt a budgetary process and give us clear sight of the amount of money in future years is\u2014. My understanding is that that's difficult for them to do, and I would repeat what I said earlier: officials have been as helpful as I think they can be in respect of that. , you're right, we've only got a political commitment between two people currently in post. darren millar am: that statement about the savings accrued from Diamond being reinvested wholly into the HE sector has not been repeated, frankly, has it, since the coalition deal was struck? dr david blaney: No, but it hasn't been rescinded either, so\u2014. darren millar am: No, but there have been opportunities\u2014repeated opportunities\u2014in the Chamber, where the Cabinet Secretary's been asked to repeat that commitment, and the First Minister's\u00a0been asked to repeat that commitment and has not given that commitment. That must concern you, and must concern your university sector even more than, perhaps, some of the elements of Brexit that we're discussing. dr david blaney: Bethan has outlined earlier on in this session the fact that institutions are currently running deficit budgets in order not to lose the infrastructure on the assumption that the Diamond money will come in. If anything were to cause significant perturbation, either to the timeline of that or to it coming in at all, then there would be much more of what Medwin Hughes calls 'houskeeping' that would be required, and that would be significant. So, at the moment\u2014I don't like the expression 'valley of death', but there is a valley to cross, and I think the sector is reasonably confident about how wide and how deep that valley is. So, there are several valleys that they're crossing\u2014the metaphor fails, doesn't it, really, but I think you get the drift? So, there are a number of challenges and they can see their way out of some of those challenges, but if any one of these starts to get significantly disrupted, then that would be a real issue for them. Could I go on to ask about other barriers to Welsh universities gaining more funding from UK research councils? What would you say those barriers are? dr david blaney: Well, I think there are a couple of things, really, to say. The first one\u2014and we'll sound like a stuck record if we're not careful\u2014is that there's an issue about investment and the Reid report makes this very clear. So, he has reaffirmed research that had been done previously that identifies that, actually, the quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them, and that, in the end, is a product of investment decisions. They have particularly looked at the deficit\u00a0in science, technology, engineering and mathematics areas, and I always say that research is not just STEM. , STEM is important, and I'm not denying the deficit in that area, but we have to also remember that the research agenda for Wales is not just STEM\u2014it's arts, humanities, it's social sciences. The Welsh impact in its research is better than anywhere else in the UK, so that's good. So, they do very well, and we just really need to invest a little bit further\u2014so continue to do very well, but put it on a broader front. If you want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, then the investment has two dimensions to it. One is just having enough researchers to be able to play into those increasingly larger projects rather than small-scale projects. If you haven't got the critical mass, it's very hard to make the case that you can play. And the second thing is that UK-wide research pots nearly always fund at about 80 per cent of the total cost of the research, and the other 20 per cent is meant to be found from the core research funding for the university, and if you're in a situation where your core research funding is not competitive, then you're not going to be competitive at getting that money. I think it's fair to say that the Welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils, making sure they're in the various committees and so on. We are intending to do a bit of work to see if we can systematise that a bit better\u2014that engagement\u2014because there's no doubt about it: it's not to say that this system is in any way inappropriate, but the more you're in the conversations, the more likely you are to be better placed to respond to the research challenges that come up. One final question: in terms of the researcher collaborations and networks that exist, do you see potential difficulties after Brexit for the continuation and enhancement of those, and are there any particular lessons to learn from\u00a0S\u00ear Cymru II? dr david blaney: I think that there are two things to say here as well. First of all, the Brexit deal might or might not impact adversely\u00a0on the capacity of Welsh and, indeed, UK research infrastructure to play into broader collaborative activity across Europe, and, in a sense, that's a function of the deal whatever the deal looks like, and we'll have to wait and see. But we've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe, and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity. It's not just the money, it's being in the club and it's the signalling that we're in the game. And then the other part of my response to this would be that, actually, Wales will need to continue to be good at the research it does, so maintaining the quality, maintaining the impact, and hopefully growing\u00a0the critical mass. The S\u00ear Cymru initiative has been quite important in doing that, because it's been very focused, capturing key research players, and the attractiveness that that has then to other researchers around them, and to industry collaboration, and they have been areas of real strength that we've invested in. And I think they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding, and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market. darren millar am: Just very briefly, one of the pieces of feedback that the committee members received at a stakeholder engagement event, which took place prior to this inquiry starting, to receive oral evidence, was about the research funding that is available from the charitable sector, and how poorly Wales does in attracting some of that research. I think we had some figures from the British Heart Foundation, which said they have \u00a3100 million a year available for research grants, or something like that, and we're getting 1 per cent of that coming into Wales, which is\u00a0obviously pretty low down. I appreciate that research into the type of activity that they want to put their money into, Wales may not be\u00a0particularly good at, and there may be other opportunities with other charities and partnerships. What work are you doing in order to build the capacity that Wales has to attract more of that charitable sector research funding into Wales? bethan owen: One of the issues is the capacity to engage with that funding,\u00a0because of the overhead issue that David mentioned. Again, that could be built in to our funding, if we had the capacity to increase our quality-related research funding. darren millar am: But that pressure's the same in other parts of the UK, is it not? So the overhead funding is still an issue in England, and in other places. bethan owen: There is an increased contribution, and I think it's an element that was increased this year to acknowledge that. I'm fairly certain that some of our institutions will be very strong with the cancer charities, possibly not the heart foundation. darren millar am: So, this gearing issue that you mentioned earlier on, for every \u00a31 that somebody else puts on the table, they can draw in another \u00a34 on top, because that \u00a31 will cover the overheads, whereas the rest of the research cash\u2014. You know, we sometimes get into a conversation about the unhypothecated nature of our research funding, but actually that creates a\u00a0flexibility and the infrastructure investment that allows institutions to be able to respond to these other opportunities. Without that, they can't do it, because if you're not careful, you've got\u00a0institutions engaging in UK-wide or charity-based research activities where they're actually having to pay for it themselves\u2014they're running at a loss. darren millar am: So that's the main problem; it's not that Welsh universities aren't doing their best to get this cash in. Or is it a bit of both? dr david blaney: I think, in the main, universities and researchers will get their cash from wherever they can, so I don't think it's a lack of appetite. Well, thank you, both, for coming in to give evidence to the committee this morning.\u00a0You will be sent a draft of the transcript, to check for accuracy. Okay then, the next item is item 3, papers to note, the first of which is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education\u00a0on the school organisation code. The second is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from the Chair of the Finance Committee regarding scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget\u00a0for the forthcoming financial year, which we will be discussing under item 6 on the agenda. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on parental attitudes towards managing young children's behaviour. And\u00a0the final paper to note, paper to note 5, is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care\u00a0on the children and family delivery grant, which we will discuss later on in private session, if Members are content. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to exclude the public from the remainder of this meeting, and also for items 1 and 2 of the 20 September meeting"

        "Query": "Summarize the discussions on the responsibility for developing curriculum resources, the flaws in the government's pandemic relief program, the debate over the economic recovery plan, and the official acknowledgment of Taiwan's donation by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.",
        "Summary": "The responsibility for determining the curriculum was seen as a joint effort between Philip Blaker and the Welsh Government. The opposition party raised concerns about the wage subsidy program, stating that some companies were unable to access it due to unnecessary barriers. However, the Deputy Prime Minister argued that the program was designed to support as many companies as possible. The government was urged to provide a comprehensive overview of the economic situation and emergency measures, but the minister emphasized the importance of considering each phase of the recovery. The Minister of Foreign Affairs highlighted the significance of the One China agreement and expressed gratitude for global cooperation in combating the Covid-19 virus.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): We'll call this meeting to order. Welcome to the fifth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Pursuant to the order passed on Monday, April20, the committee is meeting today to consider ministerial announcements, to allow members of the committee to present petitions, and to question ministers, including the Prime Minister, about the COVID-19 pandemic. Tomorrow, May8, Dr.AndreaMcCrady, Dominion Carillonneur, will give a special recital to mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Victory in Europe Day, VE Day, commemorates the formal acceptance of Germany's surrender by allied forces at the end of the Second World War. While the pandemic prevents us from gathering to celebrate in person, tomorrow at noon the voice of our nation will ring out in remembrance of this milestone in our history. Just so you are aware, the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee. I would like to remind members that, as in the House of Commons or committee, they should not take photos of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of the interpreters and to allow the meeting to proceed smoothly, I would ask you to follow some instructions. When you are ready to speak, click on the microphone icon to activate your microphone, or hold the space bar down while you are speaking. If you release the bar, your microphone will revert to mute, just like a walkie-talkie. Honourable members, I would like to remind you that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should you need to request the floor outside of your designated speaking time, you should activate your mike and state that you have a point of order. If a member of the committee wishes to intervene on a point of order raised by another person, you should use the raised hand function to indicate to the chair that you wish to speak. Should any technical challenges arise, for example, in relation to interpretation, please advise the chair immediately by raising a point of order, and the technical team will work on resolving them. If you get accidentally disconnected, please try to rejoin the meeting with the information you used to join initially. Before we get started, please note that in the top right-hand corner of your screen is a button that you can use to change views. Speaker view allows you to focus on the person currently speaking; gallery view allows you to see a larger number of participants. You can click through the multiple pages in the gallery view to see who is on and how many more participants there are. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. In addition, to ensure a petition is considered properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for a petition certified in a previous Parliament should be mailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. Chair, five years ago when Parliament passed Bill C-14, then justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said that it represented a finely tuned balance between access and safeguards. Petitioners on the first petition I'm presenting are very concerned to see Bill C-7 before Parliament, which removes safeguards ahead of that five-year review. Petitioners specifically mention their concerns about the removal of the mandatory 10-day reflection period, which can already be waived in certain circumstances. They are concerned about reducing the number of witnesses required to oversee it and ensure that a request has been properly made. The second and final petition that I will be presenting today is with respect to Senate Bill S-204. This would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who did not consent. This responds specifically to concerns about organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China involving Falun Gong practitioners and increasing concerns that this is being or about to be applied to Uighurs as well. Petitioners are noting that in the previous Parliament there were bills on this, Bill C-350 and Bill S-240. Now, in this Parliament there is a bill, Bill S-204, and the petitioners hope that this 43rd Parliament will be the one that gets it passed. This is my first occasion to present a petition in our virtual format of the COVID-19 committee. The petition I am presenting today, which was previously approved, is from a number of constituents who are concerned that we pursue the Paris Agreement to hold the global average temperature increase to no more than 1.5C. The Paris Agreement itself embeds in it the concept of Just Transition with a capital J and a capital T, the concept of just transition ensuring fairness and support for all workers in the fossil fuel sector. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to move forward with an act to ensure just transition and to ensure adequate funding so that workers and communities dependent on the fossil fuel sector receive meaningful support to ensure security in their lives in the transition to more sustainable energy use. I want to thank the honourable members for their usual collaboration and now we'll go on to mr. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): On a point of order, Mr. Chair, on Tuesday, at our COVID-19 committee of the whole meeting, I was asking a question which started at 12:56:06 and was cut off at 1:00:32, so I still have 34 seconds of time remaining in my question time of five minutes. If you believe that my time was unjustly cut off and that it was unfair treatment of the official opposition when we were raising our points of order, I would ask that the 34 seconds be tacked on to the opening round for the opposition and credited to Rosemarie Falk, who will be leading off for the Conservatives. the chair: Normally what happens is the chair uses judgment, and with 35 seconds, there isn't enough time obviously for a full question or answer, most of the time. I want everyone to know that I do have a timer next to me and I am timing the questions, and I will be treating the answers the same way. We've taken a little bit of the chair's ability to give judgment on it, but it will be from now on. I would like to remind the honourable members that no member will be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. Will the Prime Minister stand up for Canada's energy workers, or does he agree with the fringe left and those who want to destroy our country? ms. Chair, I believe that the language that the honourable member just used is unparliamentary mr. It is unacceptable to assert that anyone who wants to make a point about our economy is trying to destroy the country. As I pointed out this morning in my press conference, we cannot move forward on a transformation of our energy sector without supporting the workers in that energy sector. We need their innovation and we need their hard work if we are going to lower our emissions, if we are going to reach our the chair: We'll go to Ms. Chair, it has been 43 days since the finance minister promised Canada's energy sector liquidity through the Business Development Bank of Canada. If the government doesn't step up to support our energy sector, they are in effect doubling down on their support for foreign, unethically sourced oil. Chair, when will the credit options be available to Canada's small and medium energy firms? the chair: I want to remind honourable members that we do have interpreters who are listening and translating. Chair, from the very beginning, our priority through this pandemic and this crisis has been to support workers across the country. We have sent billions of dollars to workers right across the country, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, B.C., and Newfoundland and Labrador in the energy sector for them to be able to support their families through this difficult time. The announcements to date fall well short of what is needed to maintain a steady supply of affordable and healthy food. Instead of responding to specific COVID-19 challenges, our farmers are facing the Liberals' reannounced $125 million that was already budgeted in the AgriRecovery program. Will the Prime Minister finally step up and take our food supply chain seriously, or is agriculture just an afterthought for him? right hon. Chair, we take agriculture and our agricultural sector extremely seriously, which is why we announced hundreds of millions of dollars a couple of days ago to respond to pressing needs. We will continue to make investments to ensure both the safety of workers in our agricultural sector and the safety of our communities, as well as the continued flow of high-quality Canadian food onto our tables right across the country. Our farmers are faced with rising operational costs, a disrupted service industry, labour shortages and a reduced capacity at processing plants. When will the Prime Minister deliver adequate support to address the critical changes facing our ag industry? right hon. Chair, I would suggest respectfully that the honourable member take a look once again at the announcement we made, which actually highlights significant new investments to support our agricultural industry. Every step of the way in this unprecedented situation, we've been moving forward on doing more, on adjusting and on investing more. We need to support our agricultural sector and the people who work so hard to put food on Canadians' tables right across the country and we will continue to. Chair, Canadians expect to find healthy and affordable food at their grocery stores, but if the government does not take action now, that's not a given. It is an enormous hit to their bottom line, and the recent carbon tax hike is taking even more money out of the pockets of farmers at a time when they can afford it the least. Will the Prime Minister exempt all farm operations from the carbon tax and reimburse the money that they have already taken from them? right hon. Chair, it's a shame to hear the member opposite accidentallyunintentionally, I'm certainmislead the House and Canadians. This is the way of creating a better future for our kids and grandkids, which I know people in communities right across the country, including our farm communities, want to see happen. We are moving forward in a responsible way to put a price on pollution and put more money in average Canadians' pockets. marilne gill (manicouagan, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I am thinking about the lobster fishery in the Magdalen Islands, the crab fishery on the Cte-Nord or those fishing for herring in the south of the Gasp. Because imports have ceased, because the domestic market is weak and in decline because of the interruption of the tourism and restaurant industries, the fishing industry and its fishers must be supported. justin trudeau: Our fishers do exceptional work that is extremely important in feeding Canadians and in contributing to our economic success through their exports around the world. I know about the processing industry and the $62.5million to be used essentially for freezing products, but I am talking about the fishers themselves. In addition, they feel that they will be losing money, because of the drop in the price of their resource. They are just as essential as farmers, but they are going to have to work at a loss and they are not going to have workers to assist them. Are you going to do anything else, in addition to the assistance of $62.5million? Time is of the essence. We recognize the challenges that fishers must face in terms of social distancing and of work that is often seasonal. We are going to continue working with the industry, with the fishers, and with the coastal communities in order to ensure that people have confidence in their abilities and in their future. In times of crisis, it is important for the government to be there to support people, and that is exactly what we are going to continue to do. But, given the cyclical nature of the industry, some sectors have had to postpone for several weeks the preparations they need for fishing activities. The current program could be modified in a number of ways, to accommodate the cycle, the dates, and the size of the companies. They would really like to take advantage of the $40,000loan, but they cannot because of their payroll. I can already suggest a number of solutions to the government and to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, that would bring help to those businesses very quickly. The fishers carry on, because it is a duty for them, because they want to help us and to be part of the effort at this time of crisis. I would really like to hear a guarantee that they will be supported, that they will be able to put food on the table this year, and that they will be able to support the communities that often depend on the fishing industry, a major industry in those communities. justin trudeau: Minister Jordan has been working with the fishers, the fishing industry and the communities affected by the crisis since the crisis began. From the outset, our priority has been to support the millions of Canadians from coast to coast who have lost their jobs. We have been able to do so, but we are going to continue to work for those who must now face difficulties. the chair: Before we move to the next question, I would like to remind members of the committee to speak slowly, and to address their remarks to the chair and not directly to each other. They've seen revenues plummet, and at the same time the cost of delivering municipal services has risen. As the Prime Minister knows, municipalities are unable to run deficits and so they are facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that Canadians depend on. They're going to be even more important during the recovery, especially when it comes to delivering on the infrastructure programs before us. My question for the Prime Minister is, when can they expect federal financial support to arrive? right hon. Chair, no government in Canada's history has done more to work with our municipalities, with our cities, with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to respond to the challenges they're facing and to partner with them. Things from infrastructure to investments have made a huge difference right across the country in the quality of life of Canadians in towns, large and small, from coast to coast to coast. As I'm sure the member well knows, our Constitution requires that most of the funding for municipalities flow through the provinces. We are working with the provinces, as we continue to work with the cities, to ensure that we're able to support this order of government that delivers the vast majority of services to Canadians with very little financial means. Chair, it would seem that the federal government has the fiscal capacity and the responsibility to help municipalities weather this crisis. Transit systems have been hit particularly hard and have seen the bulk of the layoffs in the municipal sector. These transit services carry essential workers to work, whether they are health care workers, grocery store workers, janitors or others. We will see service cutbacks precisely at a time when we want to be expanding transit and improving transit in our communities. Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that the federal government needs to step in to safeguard and protect Canada's transit services? right hon. Chair, this federal government recognizes how important it is to support all Canadians, which is why we put forward unprecedented measures to help millions upon millions of Canadians with the CERB and with the wage subsidy. I'll be having a conversation with all other first ministers tonight to talk about a broad range of issues. We have continued to engage with them, but again, it is important to respect the Constitution and understand that funding for municipalities and cities does go through the provinces. The federal government is happy to be there to support, but it must be the chair: We will go to Mr. Chair, I am wondering how the Prime Minister could explain to a bus driver in Vancouver who has been laid off that as a public sector worker, she can't access the federal wage subsidy, while an equivalent worker in the airline industry gets to keep her job with the federal help of that program. Chair, I'm happy to explain to the member and to all Canadians that our Constitution creates federal areas of jurisdiction and provincial areas of jurisdiction. The airline industry, like banking, like telecommunications, is a federal area of jurisdiction that we have been able to move forward on. More than that, we brought the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy to all industries across this country, because we knew that as the federal government, it was something that we needed to step up on the chair: We will go back to Mr. Faced with minimal health care capacity, remote indigenous communities in my riding are taking matters into their own hands. The Nuxalk have put up a checkpoint on Highway 20 to protect community members and prevent non-essential travel. In particular, it is to protect the three remaining fluent speakers of the Nuxalk language, these cherished elders in their community. The Haida on Haida Gwaii have set up a similar checkpoint, as have communities throughout British Columbia, yet federal support for indigenous communities amounts to only $39 million for all of the indigenous communities in B.C. Does the Prime Minister not agree that more support is warranted to help indigenous communities in my riding and across the country? right hon. Chair, from the very beginning, we made funds available to Canadians right across the country, particularly people in indigenous remote or northern communities who we knew would be facing more difficult challenges because of the existing vulnerabilities in their health care system and socio-economic circumstances. We have made unprecedented investments and we will continue to make the necessary investments, because we need to make sure that indigenous Canadians, and indeed all Canadians, have the supports they need to make it through this crisis. luc berthold (mganticl'rable, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr.Chair. I am going to keep talking about the area of jurisdiction that the Prime Minister likes to talk about, except that I want to point out the incompetence of the Liberals in keeping their commitments on infrastructure projects. As the provinces gradually restart their economies, can the Prime Minister tell us how many projects that the provinces have submitted are waiting for approval from his government? mr. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, I hope that the length of the pause will not be taken out of my time. catherine mckenna (minister of infrastructure and communities): I'm sorry, Mr.Chair, I was on mute. It is very important to build projects that will create good jobs the chair: We are returning to Mr.Berthold. How many projects are currently awaiting government approval? I know that the minister has been meeting virtually with the provinces over the last few days. Rather than wait for the right political opportunity to approve these files, will the minister commit today to respecting the provinces and approving by next week all the projects that are sitting on her desk? hon. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, I'm pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories. We will announce the approval of projects because it's very important for our economy, our communities and creating good jobs. luc berthold: Does the minister understand that she hasn't told us how many projects are still pending? The construction season is very short. Approval of a project in July means that work can't begin until next year, which won't help revive our economy. catherine mckenna: I want to make it clear that we have approved hundreds of projects in the last few weeks. These projects are important for the economy and the environment, as well as for jobs the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, while the minister is calling for a green recovery of the country's economy, public transit is at risk. The Union des municipalits du Qubec estimates that the monthly losses are between $75million and $100million. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, we recognize the importance of public transit for our economy, since some essential workers use public transit. As the Prime Minister said, it's the provinces that must help because the money the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, once again, what we're hearing is that the government is passing the buck to the provinces. Unfortunately, the minister was unable to answer a single question about the number of infrastructure projects still on the federal government's desk, which is very important. In terms of the number of projects that we've approved, I would be happy to inform the hon. member of the exact number of all the approved projects that my department has been working very hard on over the past few months to approve projects to go forward. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, do I have any time left? the chair: No, your time is up. On March 28, the minister personally tweeted out a thank you to the People's Republic of China for donating PPE to Canada. More recently, Taiwan donated half a million surgical masks to Canada, yet here we are, two weeks later, and the minister has yet to personally thank Taiwan for its generosity. I can say, after my COVID foreign ministers call, that the world community has come together to make sure that supply chains will remain intact and that we will have transit hubs and air bridges. Chair, I didn't hear a thank you there, so I'm going to try again. On May 4, the Government of Taiwan delivered 25,000 surgical masks to the Government of British Columbia. Minister of Citizens' Services Anne Kang and Minister of State for Child Care Katrina Chen, who, as ministers, officially thanked the Government of Taiwan for its donation. Again, will the minister now do the right thing and, on behalf of Canadians, recognize the generosity of Taiwan and thank its government for that timely donation? hon. Chair, as I said to you before, Canada is grateful to all who have given supplies to Canada. As I said, when it comes to global health, when it comes to helping each other, I think it is a duty for all to come together. We are grateful and thankful for all those who have agreed to help Canada and Canadians from coast to coast to coast in times of need. I've repeated that and have said many times in many forums that we are grateful and thankful to all of those who are helping Canada. The Government of Taiwan has been the world leader in successfully fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, the People's Republic of China continues to oppose Taiwan's membership in the World Health Organization. Will the minister now do the right thing and assure Canadians that he will fully support efforts to grant Taiwan membership in the World Health Organization? hon. That said, we support Taiwan to continue meaningful participation in international multilateral forums, particularly when it comes to health. We also believe that Taiwan's role as an observer in the World Health Assembly meeting is of interest to the international health community and we have been supportive of that. Can he tell us exactly how many Canadians remain abroad who have expressed a desire to be repatriated? hon. As of today, we have repatriated more than 20,000 Canadians on 232 flights from 87 countries. As the Prime Minister and I have said from the beginning, we will make our best effort to repatriate everyone who wants to come back home during the crisis. My office has received correspondence from Canadians concerned that trial delays due to COVID-19 may result in criminals walking free. As this government has been working overtime to criminalize law-abiding citizens with new and useless gun laws, will the Minister of Justice ensure that real criminals will not walk free as a result of delays in the justice system? hon. We have been working with my provincial counterparts across Canada, as well as with the various federal courts and also, through my provincial counterparts, with the superior courts and courts of appeal across Canada. Each particular jurisdiction has taken measures to ensure that basic essential services within the court system are maintained, through a variety of means, and we believe that we will be able to solve these various challenges. Chair, the regional relief and recovery fund was announced weeks ago as a way to help small and medium-sized businesses in rural communities, like those in my riding. Can the minister clarify whether we are days away or weeks away from this support flowing to the businesses that need it so desperately? hon. Chair, I had the chance to talk with many of the chambers of commerce and business owners throughout Atlantic Canada, and we hear their anxiety. That's why ACOA's doing great work on the ground to make sure we can help them through this very difficult period. We have increased the budget of ACOAgood newsand I'll be coming up with the details very soon. It will be a pleasure to collaborate with him to make sure that we can help many businesses and business owners across the Atlantic region. In particular, they are unable to access the emergency business account, because they do not have a payroll. There are hundreds and thousands of small businesses in this very situation, vital small businesses in our communities, but they do not meet this requirement. What does the Minister of Finance have to say to these small businesses that are suffering right now? hon. I want all the businesses that he is talking about and all of them throughout the country to know that we continue to work very hard to make sure they're supported through this difficult period. We know that businesses are being supported through getting access to the wage subsidy to keep their employees together, and they're getting help, whether it's with rent or to defray costs by deferring GST and HST or customs duty payments. Some have a personal account that they've dealt with over the years rather than a business account, and that makes them ineligible. Chair, small businesses are concerned about their ability to survive, and no amount of deferrals, loans or subsidies can substitute for their need to be open and servicing their customers. Can the government confirm that a sectoral risk analysis has taken place to assist the provinces in reopening the economy? hon. Chair, I can assure the member that we've been very clear in terms of our strategy around reopening the economy. We need to make sure that we follow the advice of the experts and the health authorities to do so in a manner that does not compromise the health and well-being of Canadians. We of course will have a sectoral lens, and as you can see by some of the initiatives and the support packages we've put forward the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Can the government confirm that the programs currently in place will be expanded to these hard-working Canadians? hon. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we continue to work with all of our small businesses and I want to thank him for raising this very important issue. I want to assure our Canadian small businesses that we are going to continue to do this work to make sure they are supported. james cumming: Can the minister give me a date when she will be able to announce to these businesses that they will be eligible? hon. mary ng: I want to assure our Canadian small businesses of their importance and of the importance of their contributions to all of our communities. I want them to know that we continue to listen and that we will ensure that they are supported and continue to be supported during this difficult time. Can you give me a date when I can tell these thousands of businesses they will be supported if they pay dividends or if they use contractors within their businesses? hon. The landlord says that he doesn't have the 25% needed to be eligible for the program because he's already paying for common area costs and deferrals on utilities, which he will have to pay on his mortgage. Will the government reform the rent relief program to focus on tenants and not just the landlords? hon. Chair, I want to let the member know that we are working to make sure that the details of the emergency program for rent are out there so that both tenants and landlords can understand the situation. We're seeing a significant number of both landlords and tenants coming forward to register for this program, and we are convinced that it will be in the best interests of landlords to move forward and give tenants this relief. Chair, we've been hearing, however, from small business owners that their landlords don't find the government's rent relief program appealing enough. Can the government confirm, given the program's low eligibility rate, that the program will be expanded and be more efficient in helping tenants? hon. Chair, we recognize that it's critically important that all of the details of this program be out there for landlords and tenants to understand. This is a program that we've put out within the last week, and we are confident that it's in the best interests of tenants and landlords. One easy way to do that would be to expand the Canada summer jobs program to businesses with over 50 employees. Will the government consider doing so to allow students to gain that very valuable work experience over the coming months? hon. The second uptake provided employers across the country with the ability to add their needs for students to the mix. During this pandemic, the government has consistently called for a team Canada, non-partisan approach, and I was glad to hear that said a little earlier today. However, at the same time, the current government has used a parliamentary back door to launch a poorly thought out gun ban. We have a government that didn't win the popular vote, and I'm just wondering how I explain to my residents, because I'm getting so many calls, that this is not a bloated response because, quite frankly, it is. Chair, I think the honourable member can explain to his constituents that the forming of regulations through order in council is actually the process prescribed in law in Canada under section 117.15 of the Criminal Code. I would also invite the member to advise his constituents that way back in 1991, when there were some Conservatives who called themselves Progressive, the Mulroney government brought forward, in Bill C-17, the authority under that section for an order in council to prescribe specific makes, models and variants of military firearms as prohibited or restricted. terry dowdall: I'm not sure, but I'm hoping, that I'll get an honest answer on this question from the minister, who has everything from rocket launchers to basically toy guns on the ban list. When will we get the cost of this buyback program? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to please be careful in their language when they are referring to others. I won't comment on this one particularly, but I want all of you to be very, very careful when referring to other members. Chair, to respond to some of the obfuscations and deceptions that have been put out there. I think it's very clear, and I invite the member to look at the list of weapons that are the chair: We'll go back to Mr. bill blair: Actually, I'm very much looking forward to bringing forward legislation as soon as the House resumes. We will have a vigorous debate in Parliament about the form a buyback will take and we will bring forward a budget at that time. bill blair: If people are illegally in possession of the weapons and they're committing a crime, they will be dealt with for the crimes they commit. Canadians in my riding who suffer from cystic fibrosis are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. While these Canadians with existing lung conditions are incredibly worried about a virus that attacks the ability to breathe, the good news is that there are life-saving medicines for those with CF. I am wondering if and when the government will correct these guidelines and give access to life-saving medicines for our most vulnerable. Chair, as you know, the government has been very committed to improving access and affordability for prescription medications for all Canadians. The PMPRB regulatory amendments will help Canadians be able to afford their prescriptions, and Canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines. In fact, many countries with much lower medicine prices gained access to new medicines in the same time frame as Canada frame, or even faster, so we are excited to do this work. Chair, our seniors are being particularly hard hit right now during this pandemic, yet seniors have not been given any direct support. Funding to charities like the United Way is being labelled as support for seniors, but most won't see any of this support. Seniors in my riding have asked for an increase in their CPP and OAS, and to be able to make untaxed bulk withdrawals from their RRSPs while they still have some value. deb schulte (minister of seniors): I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. the chair: You might want to try your space bar and keep it down while you're speaking. I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. We've reduced the minimum RRIF withdrawal by 25%, and we've made the CERB available to working seniors who have lost their jobs due to the COVID pandemic. We know there's more work to do, and we'll have more to say in the future. the chair: I want to remind honourable members that if there are issues, we are taking note of them, and we'll hopefully resolve them by the next meeting. marie-hlne gaudreau (laurentideslabelle, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. In fact, we have been looking at a number of ways to support increased contact tracing across the country, including working with provinces and territories to boost their capacity through human resources and volunteer organizations. Anything we put forward as a digital tool to assist with contact tracing would be thoroughly considerate of Canadians' privacy rights. But you know as well as I do that the Privacy Commissioner has been calling us to task for a very long time now, because there is also a crisis of confidence. You know as well as I do that for 90%of Canadians, the misuse of their personal data is a cause for concern, whether it be for profiling or business development purposes. I'd like to know whether this commitment will be implemented quickly so that legislation can be passed on this issue, in this case the Privacy Act. We're talking about what is going on in Quebec, among other places, and I would like to make sure that the federal government commits to respecting the proposals regarding geolocation and contact tracing possibilities, with full respect for the right to privacy. We have worked very closely with provinces and territories for a long time before the outbreak, but certainly ever since the outbreak. We respect the rights of jurisdictional authorities to use tools that have been properly vetted through their own provincial and territorial legislation. marie-hlne gaudreau: Concerning privacy, there are 30million Quebeckers and Canadians who have had their personal data leaked. Why is it that our laws don't allow us to apply financial penalties so that we can then go further? The very basis is to be concerned about our fundamental rights. As the critic for access to information and privacy, I'd like a commitment that the federal government will deal not with what the provinces are doing, but with the Privacy Act. the chair: Your time is up, but I'll give the floor to the minister for 30seconds. Our government will ensure the privacy of Canadians is respected, support responsible innovation and take reasonable steps to strengthen enforcement powers. yvan baker (etobicoke centre, lib.): Thank you very much, Mr. Minister, in my riding of Etobicoke Centre, we are mourning the loss of 40 residents to COVID-19 at the Eatonville long-term care centre. Of all Canadians who have died from COVID-19, 79% were living in long-term care homes. I understand that long-term care homes fall within the jurisdiction of provincial governments in Canada, but this is a crisis. What is the federal government doing right now to help protect our seniors who are living in long-term care homes from COVID-19? What will we do to reform our long-term care homes in the future to ensure that our seniors in Etobicoke Centre and across Canada get the care they deserve? hon. We are deeply concerned by the outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities, and our thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one. As my colleague mentioned, while these facilities are regulated by provinces and territories, we have been focused on protecting the health and safety of long-term care residents and staff while working with our partners in a team Canada approach. We're working with the provinces and territories to cost-share a temporary salary top-up for long-term care workers. We are working through investing $2 billion to secure personal protective equipment for the health of workers, including those in the long-term care homes, and we've deployed the Canadian Armed Forces to assist 25 long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario. We all have a role to play to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect our seniors and caregivers. At the finance committee, we've heard a lot of concerns from all sectors of the economy as a result of COVID-19 and we've been presented with quite a number of possible solutions as well, several of which the government has acted upon. It is very welcome support, but I sincerely believe the farm sector will be taking the Prime Minister up on the suggestion that $250 million should be seen as an initial investment. However, as a result of reduced processor contracts for next year, plus cancelled seed contracts, millions of dollars of seed and process potatoes have no home. How does the minister see Tuesday's announcement addressing potato farmers' concerns? Second, in 2013, long-term financial safety nets were gutted by the Harper government. We know the importance of our potato farmers, and that's why we are launching a first-ever surplus food purchase program, a $50-million fund designed to help redistribute existing inventories, such as potatoes, to local food organizations. On the financial safety net that we have in place for our farmers, called the business risk management program, we announced up to $125 million in funding through AgriRecovery and made changes to AgriStability that will help producers quickly. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that BRM programs, including AgriInvest, are there to help farmers in difficult times. Robyn, who has owned Arbutus Health in Tofino for over 13 years, can't apply for the Canada emergency business account loan, simply because she doesn't have a payroll of over $20,000. With no business income and without emergency financing, it is virtually impossible for her to pay her bills or come up with the 25% needed for the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program. The government promised to be flexible and willing to adjust its COVID response rollout so that nobody falls through the cracks, but Robyn, like tens of thousands of proprietors who are the economic job creators of our communities, urgently needs the government's help now. Will the government amend its programs to help more business owners so that people like Robyn don't lose their businesses? hon. I know he and I have talked about this, and I appreciate the input and the feedback that he is providing from business directly. I want to assure Robyn and her businesses, and many businesses across the country, that we are absolutely listening, and we will continue to make sure we are supporting those businesses during this period. We also know that more has to be done, and we will continue to work with you and businesses across the country so that we can indeed give them that necessary support to weather this difficult period of COVID-19. I was talking to Heather last night, who also owns a business in Tofino, Basic Goodness Pizzeria, with her partner Marco. Like many proprietors of family businesses who aren't on payroll, they don't qualify for the business loans. Now with the new rollout of the rent support, they're not sure if their landlord is willing to play ball and even apply. Heather was in tears last night as she told me that they have done nothing wrong to deserve being excluded from these emergency programs. Will the government fix the rent support program so that tenants can apply, instead of leaving it up to landlords, and so businesses can get the help they desperately need? hon. We've been working on offering a response for small businesses and charities and non-profit organizations, and we are continuing to listen on the ground to how we can better assist the businesses that fall through the cracks. Chair, when the government rolled out its commercial rent support program, why didn't it negotiate an eviction moratorium with the provinces, as Australia and other countries did, to protect business owners? hon. We've recognized it and we've been working with the provinces and territories to implement the Canada emergency commercial rent the chair: We'll go back to Mr. gord johns: To qualify for the Canada emergency wage subsidy, a 30% drop in revenue has to be shown. Anyone who's owned a business knows that even with this program, it's going to be hard to survive. Why is the government using a 70% measurement drop to qualify for the rent support program, but a 30% drop for the wage subsidy? hon. We've been working with provinces and territories to provide forgivable loans to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rents for their tenants by 75%. We're hoping that tenants and landlords will be working together so we can support businesses during this very difficult crisis. the chair: Before we move on to the next question, Mr.Berthold, did you have a question or a point of order? mr. I checked the clock from the first round of five minutes, and as you may recall, it took a very long time for me to get an answer from the government. During my first turn, it took 50seconds before a government minister deigned to answer my questions. After checking my time, I realized that the discussion between Ms.McKenna and I went on for four minutes and 14seconds, so I wasn't able to ask the minister one final question, a very important one. I would ask you to take that into account and allow me to ask MinisterMcKenna one last question, please. the chair: The person chairing the meeting uses their judgment and does their best to keep an eye on what's going on. I think it's more or less equal for all the members, but I apologize if the honourable member feels that he was denied a few seconds. bill blair: The decision to close the border was made in Canada by Canadians in the best interest of Canadians. todd doherty: When will the government be in a position to inform Canadians of any changes to the agreement? hon. bill blair: I'm pleased to advise the member that we're continuing to monitor the situation, but I'm strongly of the opinion that the circumstances on both sides of our border do not indicate that this is the right time to make a change in the restrictions. todd doherty: Can the government confirm whether there are any discussions about reopening the border to certain modes of transportation and restricting others? the chair: Before I go to the minister, I want to remind the honourable members that we do have translators, and they are trying to translate. With respect to them, I know we're trying to get as many questions in as possible, but they do have to translate them, so please be considerate of our interpreters. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Let me please inform the honourable member that we are, of course, aware that the current agreement expires. navdeep bains: We are engaged with the industry, and we are working with them on a solution, Mr. Chair, will this relief package include funding for airline ticket refunds similar to what other countries around the world have done? Yes or no? hon. Chair, I can confirm that Air Canada has now adopted a policy of checking temperatures for passengers boarding Air Canada flights. Last week I asked the Minister of Labour if they were aware of a letter written on April 6 by CUPE to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Minister, were you aware of that letter? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly. todd doherty: On April 6, CUPE wrote a letter to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Before that I had conversations with CUPE with respect to flight attendants and the use of personal protective equipment. todd doherty: Can the minister confirm whether or not they have provided PPE to the flight attendants and/or training for front-line staff for airlines and airports? hon. This has become a policy to ensure the safety not only of passengers on board but also of the flight attendants and flight crew. He stated that he couldn't give his small business tenants a break on rent because the government is penalizing him for paying off his mortgage. Chair, as you know, we laid out the CECRA program just last week, and we are encouraging landlords to take that opportunity to support the renters. Is the minister aware of this, and are they trying to revise the CECRA program? hon. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with provinces and territories to present that program. We are asking, actually encouraging, landlords to do their part and help tenants, like the one you mentioned, go through this. It's been heartbreaking, frankly, to hear that everything they've built and sacrificed for is in serious jeopardy, and through no fault of their own. Your government has created programs that are supposed to help them, but many legitimate businesses aren't able to apply. I'm hoping to hear specifics, not just nice words, on what you're going to do to help them. First, businesses that recently incorporatedfor example, in late 2019are unable to apply their entire 2019 payroll. As a result, many are falling short of the $20,000 payroll threshold required to qualify for this loan. What is your government going to do about these three scenarios? the chair: I just want to remind honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly to the minister. As well, please take into consideration the interpreters, who have to listen and translate, so that we can have this conversation. Right from the very beginning, we've always said that we will listen and that we will work to make sure that measures go out to help our Canadian small businesses. She's absolutely right: 98% of all our businesses in this country are small businesses, so they absolutely contribute enormously to our communities and are job creators. For the Canada emergency business account, over 550,000 small businesses have been approved and are getting that support. I can assure the honourable member that we will continue to do this work so that businesses, all businesses, are supported, whether it is helping keep your employees together, helping with rent support, helping to keep your business's expenses low, or of course helping with the capital that is needed so that you can pay your operating expenses and your bills through this difficult time. Moving on, there are two issues regarding the 50% commercial rent assistance subsidy, where landlords pay 25%, the government pays 50%, and the tenant is responsible for 25%. First, many of the small landlords aren't able to take a 25% hit to their income, and are unable to provide the subsidy to their tenants. Second, with the 70% decline in revenue threshold for small businesses to even be eligible for the rent assist, many restaurants are at 65% or 67% decline. What is the government planning to do to streamline this program for small businesses that can't access but desperately need the rent subsidy? hon. Chair, as the Minister of Official Languages, I just want to raise the fact that interpretation is very complicated right now. In order to make sure that we can continue to uphold bilingualism within the House, I would love it if my colleagues could take down the pace a bit. I just want to remind everyone again that when you're asking a question, make sure you are doing it at a pace at which you're considering the people who are interpreting ms. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with the provinces and territories to provide this forgivable loan to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rent of their tenants by 75%. It will be very important that we understand what happens across the country, and we will monitor and adapt the program as we ms. Chair, it has been in the media quite a bit that this rent subsidy is not helping many, many, many small business owners. It's falling short of everything that was announced, so I think it needs to be taken a bit more seriously than that. We know that some still fall through the cracks and we will look at how we can continue to support businesses across the country. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We are now going to Mr. Three weeks ago, on April 17, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced funding of $500 million to assist Canada's arts, sports and cultural sectors. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Madam Chair, we will be releasing the details of that announcement, and how the money is going to be spent, in the coming days. kevin waugh: We all know that many media organizations, large and small, in Canada are struggling right now. Allegations have arisen that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, is currently engaging in predatory behaviour and taking advantage of the current situation to harm its competitors using rate cuts. kevin waugh: Local community and ethnic media outlets and papers have strong ties to their communities that often go much deeper than the major media outlets. Is the government currently using any local or ethnic media outlets to provide crucial coronavirus information through advertising? hon. We need to get the information to Canadians on COVID-19, which is why we have started an ad-buy campaign of $30 million, which is being distributed in more than 900 local, regional and national newspapers across the country and 500 radio and TV stations in 12 different languages, including Farsi, Mandarin, Spanish, Italian and many more. It has received two ads from an ad agency in connection with the $30 million the government is doling out to help media outlets. Is this the kind of money you're attempting to dole out to help media: two ads in eight weeks? hon. steven guilbeault: Madam Chair, we have been doing a number of things for our media in Canada over the last few months and will continue to do so. On top of that $30 million ad-buy campaign, we have been investing $50 million in local journalism. Just this year, it means that 200 journalists will be hired in areas across the country where journalism is more poorly defined. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, last week, as the minister would know, 15 community newspapers, including eight in Manitoba and seven in the province of Ontario, closed their doors for good. Is the government currently planning any further measures aimed at assisting community or ethnic media organizations? We understand that many more will close their doors within the next 30 to 60 days. steven guilbeault: We are planning a number of other measures, some of which will be included in the $500 million. Of the $595 million that the media will receive, we have a tax credit that has now entered into force, and the cheques should be in the mail by the end of the summer. So there are a number of things we've done and a number of things we will be doing in the coming months as well. kevin waugh: Well, finally, you have the five members associated with that committee to dole out the $595 million. colleague that in order for us to provide tax breaks for the 2019 period, media outlets had to file their tax returns so we could go ahead. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. This being the first time I've had the floor during a virtual sitting of Parliament, I'd like to take this opportunity to greet my fellow members, all 259participants. I'd like to talk about the Prime Minister's appearance on the show Tout le monde en parle. This is what he had to say about his economic recovery plan:     We are going to remain focused on the economy as a wholeinnovationresearch and science, the green economy and a fairer economyThere are things we are all reflecting on right now that reflection is going to continue. Can the government assure Canadians that it is being proactive and working on a plan to get the economy moving again? It must act now. Our government is wholly committed to restarting the economy, and we are working closely with the provinces to do just that. Last week, our government, together with the provincial and territorial premiers, released the principles that will guide efforts to restore economic activity across the country. jol godin: MadamChair, before we go any further, since it took a while for the minister, or the government, to answer the question, can I have that time back to ask questions? the acting chair (mrs. The Prime Minister's answer during his appearance on Tout le monde en parle didn't inspire much confidence and doesn't line up with the Deputy Prime Minister's comments. How can the government be proud of announcing $252million in assistance for the agri-food sector, when that is less than 1% of all the program funding the government has committed to help Canadians get through the COVID-19 crisis? Clearly, the government doesn't see the food supply chain as a priority and has no regard for farmers and pork and beef producers. Does the government realize that eating is vital to Canadians? When is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food going to adjust the program and show respect for Canadian farmers? hon. This week, we focused on beef and pork producers and processors, as well as sectors with product surpluses that can be redirected to food banks. I can assure my fellow member that this is an additional step and that more supports are on the way in the weeks ahead. PortneufJacques-Cartier is home to a company that is already licensed by Health Canada and that, for 20years, has been manufacturing medical equipment including masks, face shields and thermometers. In mid-March, Health Canada reached out to the company to find out how much equipment it could manufacture to help fight COVID-19. The company confirmed that it could immediately start producing 200,000masks a week, ramping up to a million masks over the next few weeks. Can the health minister tell us why, 45days later, this company licensed by Health Canada hasn't received an order? hon. Industry and suppliers have enthusiastically answered our call to equip Canada with products and goods during the crisis. Seniors living alone are most at risk of economic insecurity, particularly single senior women, as gender inequality in the job market has translated all too often into inadequate retirement income. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a poverty reduction plan that addresses the unique challenges faced by older women? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to assure the member that we are quite aware that this pandemic has typically affected single seniors, and many of those, given that they live longer, are single senior women. I want to assure her that we are working on this issue, and we have provided some supports already through measures such as the GST supplementary payment. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, older women represent a high proportion of residents in long-term care facilities. Having spent their lives caring for parents, children and often their partners, they find themselves needing care in nursing homes. Multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Canada have highlighted systemic gaps that senior and elderly women may face in such facilities, as well as the working conditions of the female-dominated ranks of nurses and personal support workers. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a federal strategy for long-term care homes that recognizes quality of life for residents and working conditions for the employees, ideally one that goes hand in hand with a poverty reduction plan and enhanced home and community care investments across the country? hon. We are obviously deeply saddened by the outbreaks that have been going on in long-term care facilities and those who have lost their lives. We do recognize that the administration of long-term care and palliative care is the responsibility of provinces and territories; however, we have been taking a team Canada approach, and as you already know, we've been doing tremendous work with them to try to ensure that those who live in those facilities can be well cared for and safe. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, from May 4 to May 10, we are observing Mental Health Week. We know that our essential workers right now are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety, on top of putting their own physical safety and health on the line. Most of these workers work in precarious jobs with no access to paid sick leave or vacation, and without any benefits to access mental health services. Apart from the very welcome investments in online resources, can the minister explain how the government will support these workers now and once the crisis is behind us? hon. I'm so glad that she's raising the issue of mental health and in particular how poor mental health is oftentimes connected to our socio-economic status. We do have new resources that are available to all Canadians free of charge through the Wellness Together portal, but there is more to do. I think the announcement of top-up wages, for example, which the Prime Minister spoke about today, is another example of how we're taking the health and wellness of all low-income Canadians very seriously. We know that mental health is not divorced from socio-economic status, and I look forward to working with her more on other measures that we can take together. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, we're all very aware of the importance of temporary foreign workers and their role in ensuring our food sovereignty across this country. How are we protecting them? Madam Chair, will the government take action to strengthen legislation and ensure Canadians have access to the food they need while the workers who help bring it to our tables have safe working conditions, regardless of where they are working in this country? hon. We are very concerned, as are countries around the world, that we support and create the environment for the health and safety of our temporary foreign workers and we value their contribution to our food supply chain here in Canada. We have issued guidelines to employers and are working very closely with local public health authorities in the provinces and territories to make sure workers are protected, that physical distancing and other recommendations are adhered to and that there are severe consequences if employers don't take care of their workers. alistair macgregor (cowichanmalahatlangford, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. My first question is this: Will the Liberal government prevent federal bailout funds from going to companies that use tax havens and avoid paying their fair share here in Canada, yes or no? hon. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): We are working to make sure that anyone who tries to circumvent the rules faces serious consequences. Anyone who abuses the program could face fines of up to 225% of the subsidy amount as well as five years in prison. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, I didn't really hear a yes to that question, so I'll repeat it. Does the government really think it's appropriate for tax-avoiding corporations to receive funding provided for by taxpayers? hon. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, the agriculture funding announced by the government earlier this week amounts to less than 10% of what the Canadian Federation of Agriculture estimates will be required to help farmers weather this crisis. I have to remind my colleague that we have put in $5 billion through FCC, $50 million for the temporary foreign workers, two times $50 million for pork and beef producers this week, and $77 million for food processing. This is only the beginning, and we should not forget that the business risk management programs are still there to offer support. alistair macgregor: Yes, Madam Chair, but we're nearly two months into this pandemic and this announcement only came this week. marie-claude bibeau: Madam Chair, we are working closely with the farmers and their representatives to identify where the gaps are, but once again, we have made improvements to the AgriStability program. They can get, depending on the province, either 50% or 75% in advance payments, and they can also, right now, access their AgriInvest program. There is more than $2 billion ready to access today, if they have the acting chair (mrs. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, federal disability recipients and seniors on fixed incomes have been hardest hit by cost of living increases from COVID-19. If we acknowledge that $2,000 per month is the minimum needed to get through this time, why are they being asked to survive on far less? When can they expect assistance, and how much will they receive? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to make sure people realize that we have provided some assistance through the GST supplementary benefit. We are also providing support to those who are still working, and we have done that by allowing them to access the CERB. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, as I think we've heard through today's question period, there are countless example of this government designing programs to exclude many small businesses that desperately need help. Whether it's the payroll requirements or other eligibility, we still, to this day, almost two months into the pandemic, have too many small businesses falling through the cracks. Madam Chair, why has the government taken this approach and when can we finally expect fixes to the whole system? hon. mary ng: Madam Chair, right from the get-go, we have been committed to making sure that Canadians are helped through this crisis, and that small businesses get the support that they need, so that we are saving businesses and jobs in this country. yves perron (berthiermaskinong, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I hear the questions my fellow members are asking, and to be frank, I don't find the answers satisfactory. It is well and good to talk about existing programs, but they aren't working, so enough with that refrain. This morning, both farmers and processors came together for a press conference at the Union des producteurs agricoles's head office in Longueuil. Can the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food therefore tell us when she will announce significant supports for the industry? hon. marie-claude bibeau: We have already announced significant amounts of support, and more is on the way. It's not that the programs aren't working; it's that they aren't generous enough in farmers' eyes. That's why I'm working with my provincial counterparts to make improvements to programming, including AgriStability. After using the online AgriStability benefit estimator, a pork producer found out that he would get $11 per head, as they say in the industry. Pork producers are calling for $20 per head, so it's a good start, even though it's not enough and it isn't what they are asking for. We want to keep working together, but farmers have to access the money available to them through AgriStability. Even before the crisis, we were hearing from people in the industry that the programs were neither suitable nor sufficient. A few days ago, the government announced $50million in funding for pork producers, even though they are asking for $20per hog for 27million hogs. When is the government going to announce a whole lot more in funding support? What's been announced so far is only 10% of what farmers are asking for. However, I would point out to the member that, when it comes to AgriRecovery, we made an exception to the rule. That's two funding envelopes of $50million each to help cover the additional costs from the decrease in plant processing capacity. As the Prime Minister said, we are going to do more, and we are moving forward step by step. yves perron: What we concluded in committee this week is that the $125million is not new money. The government can't say that programs already exist and, at the same time, claim that they are new programs. Everyone knows that the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement came into force a month earlier than planned, despite the promises that had been made. An easy way to make money available without committing new spending is to provide compensation and announce programs for supply-managed sectors that got nothing. It seems to me that a time of crisis is a time for the government to practise some judo and announce measures. I am reaching out to the government, as I always do, but it has to come forward with announcements. marie-claude bibeau: Our commitment to farmers in supply-managed sectorsmeaning, egg, poultry and dairy farmersis as strong as it always was. Support for poultry and egg farmers is in the form of investment programs, which aligns well with the recovery. At this time, we are focusing on emergency programs to help farmers hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. As you know, legislative changes are needed to grant the Canadian Dairy Commission's request and increase its borrowing limit by $200million so it can buy more butter and cheese. Chair, we're all inundated, as we've heard during this entire question period, with Canadians' concerns about the economic restrictions and the social restrictions that they're under. Over the last couple of months, the WHO has given one very consistent message in terms of coming out of those economic and social restrictions. Tedros said in his briefing, We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. On March 25, 44 days ago, he said, Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictionstheyre also the best way to prevent them. Does the minister agree with the WHO that relentless testing and tracing are critical to a successful economic and social relaunch strategy in Canada? hon. Absolutely, we agree that testing and contact tracing will form an important part of our response to living with COVID. We've been investing heavily in ensuring that we have the lab capacity, the collaboration across provinces and territories, and the variety of testing options to help us increase our capacity to test. We are aiming right now for a high volume of tests, but I will also say that in Canada we have one of the highest testing rates in the world. Although we're doing well, I can assure him that I am with him and I believe we need to do more. Chair, as I mentioned to his colleagues yesterday, we have currently the capacity to do approximately 60,000 tests per day across the country. Chair, it's hard for me to get that exact number, but I will get back to him with the exact number. She said, As a first tranche, roughly close to 60,000 is where the provinces can potentially expand to as a target already. Does the minister happen to know, ballpark, what the average number of daily tests in Canada has been since that statement? hon. patty hajdu: Your estimate was slightly higher than what my estimate was going to be, so that's a great piece of news. Listen, I will just say that I think if the premise here is that we could be doing more testing. I would agree, but I will also say that the provinces and territories are working incredibly hard on testing strategies that meet their own specific needs. Tam works with all the chief public health officers across the country to ensure that their testing strategy is going to be applicable and appropriate for their particular jurisdictions. mike lake: Following up on that, is there a jurisdiction in Canada where relentless testing is not the appropriate strategy as provinces consider relaunching? hon. For example, in British Columbia, where there are relatively fewer cases in general and less disease activity, they may have a different testing strategy than a province like Ontario, which is currently struggling with more outbreaks. mike lake: Given your comment that our current testing capability is 60,000, and acknowledging that only at one point in the entire history of our COVID response, over several months, has our weekly average been over 30,000it was about 31,000 for one day on a rolling basisMinister, are you satisfied with our current testing amounts right now, given that we're testing 50% of what the public health officer advises would be best? hon. patty hajdu: I'm so amazed by the work the provinces and territories have done in a very short time to increase their capacity. We are supporting them with the tools that they need to get more testing done, but also to have other components in place that will allow them to do the rapid tracing of positive cases. I think it's very important to remember that testing strategies will be different across the provinces, based on the outbreak disease epidemiology. Having said that, I know that we can all do better, and I'm certain that my counterparts feel the same"

        "Query": "What were Dr. Frank Atherton's thoughts on having a target, investment, data, addressing gaps in data, and legislation to build a healthy environment?",
        "Summary": "Dr Frank Atherton emphasizes the importance of having a target that is both achievable and challenging. He believes that a target is not only a tool, but also an evaluation to assess progress. However, there is still much work to be done. In terms of investment, Dr Frank Atherton mentions that they currently invest in various areas related to child health, including obesity. The estimated investment needed for their plan is around \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million per year. Additionally, Dr Frank Atherton suggests considering diverting some of the \u00a37 billion spent on health and social care towards prevention initiatives and tackling obesity. The latest data presented by Dr Frank Atherton shows that less than a third of children aged four or five are overweight or obese, but the situation is not improving. The data also reveals that about 12% of children are severely obese. Dr Frank Atherton highlights the importance of having a longitudinal view of children's health over time, which would require significant resources. He also supports the implementation of legislation to create a healthy environment, citing examples of food takeaways. Overall, Dr Frank Atherton's goal is to address the challenges of child health and obesity through targeted strategies and investments.",
        "Article": "We've received apologies for absence from Michelle Brown and Jack Sargeant; there are no substitutions. We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. If I can just start by asking about the fact that 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that it will deliver for children and young people. We have high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults\u2014we know that, and we can't walk away from that because that's translating into demand on health services. But we have to take a focus, a future generation's focus, almost, on the next generation. I don't write off the current generation, we can't afford to do that, but we do need to think about what can we do that would be different for the next generation so that they don't get into the sorts of problems that we're currently seeing with overweight and obesity. We know that the consequences of that for our young people are going to be enormous if we don't do something and something quite soon. We know that overweight children go on to become overweight adults, unfortunately, and that brings all the consequences of multiple disease issues\u2014diabetes is often cited\u2014cancer risk et cetera. So, we have to focus on children, and, in fact, during the consultation, we've been very clear that we need to engage with children and young people as well. Perhaps we'll get into that at some point, Chair, but, yes, I can give you that assurance. What my follow-up question, really, is: can you just tell us what kind of engagement you've had with children and young people to inform the draft strategy? dr frank atherton: Well, Nathan may be able to influence some of the detail, but in broad terms, we have discussed with young people in a number of fora. In fact, I was delighted that we had a young person, Evie Morgan, a schoolgirl from mid Wales, who came to the joint launch on the consultation. She met the Minister there and gave a very good personal account of her views on obesity and overweight. I'm visiting a school, either this week or next week, at Treorchy, to talk with teachers and young people there. nathan cook: I was going to say, we've also had a session with youth ambassadors as well, and what we've actually produced for the consultation is not just the children and young people's version, but also a toolkit in terms of getting schools really engaged and involved in terms of the work that we want them to do to feed into this as well. So, we've already had some really good responses from a lot of youth group and schools already. lynne neagle am: And you've got a structured programme, have you, to roll that out? Okay. We've got some questions now on leadership, and the first questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. The Minister for health said yesterday, in answering a question from me on the Chamber floor, that you gave him advice not to have a target in terms of reducing obesity among children. Could you confirm that that's what your advice was and tell us why you don't think that a target is needed? dr frank atherton: My advice was not that we don't need a target\u2014we may well need a target, and that's one of the issues we need to consult on\u2014but that the target that had been adopted in England and in Scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable, and that if we are to choose a target in Wales, then we need to balance deliverability with challenge. So, there is something about performance management, because I would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they're delivering on this, and I think we can use targets to that. But they are one tool in the box that I would think we could use, and part of the consultation is to ask that question\u2014'If we are to go down a route in Wales of choosing a target, what might that look like?' sian gwenllian am: Okay. dr frank atherton: It's certainly something that we could consider in terms of the final strategy. Well, that is contrary to what I was told yesterday on the floor of the Chamber by the Minister, but there we go. I'm glad to hear that you're not ruling out having a target, because without a target, without something to aim for, how do we know that we're getting there? dr frank atherton: I think your point about evaluation is really important. Whatever we produce at the end of this process\u2014and we're looking to produce a final strategy towards the autumn\u2014we do need to have a strong evaluation. So, some metrics in there, it would seem, would be appropriate, but what those are, what the nature of those are, do we frame them as targets or ambitions\u2014that's the point we need to consult on. If the Government is going to be successful in terms of the aim of reducing childhood obesity, then it needs to fund and support the actions. Have you made an assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan? dr frank atherton: Resourcing will be important. We currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally, and, of course, obesity and overweight in particular. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in Wales. A figure of \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest, but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes. Can we make them more effective? Can we get better value from them? And there may well be a case for new investment, and that's a question, of course, that would need to be discussed with Ministers when we're producing the final strategy. nathan cook: But I think a key consideration as well is we already know there is investment across health boards in some kind of obesity-related services. So, I think what we really need to think about across Wales is how we can drive greater scale, how we can look at current programmes in terms of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well. sian gwenllian am: And does the level of investment depend on what the target is\u2014what the goal is? dr frank atherton: I don't think you can necessarily just link the two. The issue of resourcing is one that's there irrespective of whether we choose to put a target in place. sian gwenllian am: But how would we know that it's being used effectively if there isn't something to aim for? dr frank atherton: Which brings you back to the question about evaluation. sian gwenllian am: Yes, but without a target, how can you properly evaluate? If you don't know what you're trying to do, how can you properly evaluate? Anyway, you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on soft drinks towards some of these efforts to\u2014? dr frank atherton: Well, of course, there are some consequentials that are coming to the Welsh Government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks. That funding, of course, is less than we had anticipated, and that reflects, actually, a success story because industry is reformulating, and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease, which is a good thing. I'm not personally in favour of hypothecation, I think I'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource. And when I think about obesity, I don't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the \u00a37 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general, and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular. Could you give us any kind of figure? dr frank atherton: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? sian gwenllian am: You say that there is less money that's come in through these consequentials from the levy, can you mention some sort of figure? dr frank atherton: The figure that I have in mind is about \u00a356 million that's coming in in terms of revenue over a two-year period. When the sugar levy was first brought in, there was some modelling at UK level about what level of revenue that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. nathan cook: Yes, I was going to say, there was a mid-year report done where the levy has raised \u00a3150 million to date since coming into force in April, and the original forecast was \u00a3520 million a year. So, I think that shows the amount of work that's been done by industry around reformulation. sian gwenllian am: And the consequentials of that? That is the consequential\u2014\u00a3150 million. sian gwenllian am: Yes, so what's the Welsh consequential? lynne neagle am: Fifty-six. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million. So, obviously, you know, we can be more ambitious because there is money in that pot if that money was ring-fenced for this particular scheme. dr frank atherton: Well, the resource is going to be a real issue that we need to address, and I think as Nathan has said, there is funding of various initiatives currently in the system, and we need to look at that and make that as effective as possible. Will there be a need for some additional resource? There may well be, and that's a question that we'll have to look at in terms of the strategy when we develop it and have a discussion with Ministers about the level of resourcing. lynne neagle am: Can I just ask on that before Si\u00e2n moves on? What assessment have you made of how that money is being spent in other UK nations? Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to\u2014? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that? dr frank atherton: I'm not sure I understand your point, Chair, in terms of the link between the consequentials from\u2014. Are you talking about the consequentials from the sugar levy or are you talking about\u2014? lynne neagle am: Yes, because in other nations, it is being used to directly impact on initiatives to tackle obesity, whereas, we've kind of put it here in Wales into the general pot and it's being used to fund a plethora of different things. My preference\u2014it's a personal view\u2014is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. , what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention. lynne neagle am: No, I recognise that, and I think we're talking about additional resource. suzy davies am: I was just wondering whether you thought that there was a useful psychological link on the part of the public between saying, 'Here's a sugar levy', and 'It's going to be used to help children and adults stay healthier.' Going into a pot, it actually makes it quite difficult to explain the purpose of the tax in the first place. So, I take your overall point, but in terms of the people who we're trying to help in all this, actually creating a direct link might be quite helpful. You're putting an emphasis on the whole-system approach in implementing the plan, how are you going to create a system that co-ordinates action and drives change across relevant partners, avoiding a situation where it's everyone's role, but nobody's responsibility? How are you going to avoid that? dr frank atherton: It's a very important question, and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that, around leadership and drive nationally. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down. And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important. But I'd like to see\u2014and I know I'm a public health professional, so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system; but I would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well. So I'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this. So, we'll need some sort of national oversight, absolutely, but we need local ownership and local leadership, too. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister? dr frank atherton: Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as\u2014I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government. janet finch-saunders am: I know my colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives? dr frank atherton: Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: Could I just ask\u2014sorry to interrupt\u2014how up to date is that? dr frank atherton: The last survey was just last year. dr frank atherton: So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows\u2014. It's not getting radically worse\u2014there's always statistical variation in these things\u2014but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way. Does that answer your question? janet finch-saunders am: Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed? dr frank atherton: Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that  in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier. nathan cook: And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful. lynne neagle am: Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data? dr frank atherton: I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years\u2014what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,\u00a0 but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation? dr frank atherton: It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland\u00a0to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got\u2014we need to deploy them all. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that? dr frank atherton: I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. I think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively.\u00a0I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around? dr frank atherton: Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would\u2014it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue. Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity.\u00a0I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pinning that down a little bit? Because this is education, not health, and\u2014. dr frank atherton: Well, look, I've got to confess to you, I'm not an educationist, and so the question on staffing numbers in schools is not one that I have been asked to give a deal of consideration to, and it hasn't really been discussed, I don't believe, in the context of development of the strategy. If there is a specific point around that that the committee would like to make in terms of a response into the consultation, which I presume you'll be making, then we'd be happy to consider that. We have standards and we perhaps need to think about how we tighten those standards and how we\u2014enforce isn't the right word, but how we implement and make sure that those standards are properly implemented, because you're absolutely right to say that habits are developed early in life. That's in the preschool; it's also in the home of course, and then later in the school. So, we do need to look at all of those as settings and are there more things we can do within those settings to drive healthier behaviours\u2014that's exactly why we need the consultation. nathan cook: But I would say, through that scheme as well, we've really got a really good bank of preschools that are actually doing some really great work in this area as well. So, I think the more we can understand the successes that some of those environments are having\u2014you know, how we can roll those out and work across other settings to create that wider impact as well is going to be really important. What I'm thinking about is expectations at that level will be expectations at a slightly older level, which will be contained within the foundation phase. And while you're quite right\u2014obviously, parents have a role in this, or families\u2014there will be, particularly with the introduction of the new curriculum, certain expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children and things. And that's why I asked you about local leadership, because, if it fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the plan at foundation phase, it's going to fail further up the school years as well. I think it might be something that the board might want to consider here, because at some point there'll be an accountability question and we will want to know how 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' fits in with the new plans for the new curriculum, and whether it's merely persuasive and influential or whether it has the weight to place some obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools. So, this connection, I think, is quite an important one, and, if the strategy development board could consider that, I think it would be very helpful, because this doesn't exist in a vacuum. dr frank atherton: Well, I'd certainly be delighted to\u00a0take that back and we can look at it in terms of how we move from the consultation into the final strategy. suzy davies am: Because we will want to know who to ask: 'you're the accountable person\u2014why has something worked, or not worked?' We will need to know that at some point. dr frank atherton: Just building on Nathan's point, some of the schools\u2014I know it's schools rather than the preschools, and I take your point, but some of the schools we've been working with have absolutely brilliant models of good practice and good local leadership. I remember the Minister actually at the launch, and one of the schools was represented there, and they presented\u2014the school came and some of the children came and presented\u2014to the whole audience about the activities that they were undertaking in their school around physical activity and on healthy eating, and it was such a model of good behaviour the question was, 'Well, why not everywhere?', so that probably speaks to your question. lynne neagle am: And have you had any discussions, then, with education officials around things like teacher training and CPD, because you'll be aware the Health and Social Care Committee has made a number of recommendations in this area? It's crucial that we skill up the staff to develop these things in an appropriate way, isn't it? dr frank atherton: Well, we certainly discuss with education colleagues in Welsh Government. There's more we need to do in terms of that, because you're absolutely right: there's something about building the whole of the workforce\u2014education is really important, but elsewhere as well; it's about how do we really make every contact count, you know, that construct. So, everybody who's working in the health and social care system should have a role in this; everybody who works in education, whether it's the old\u2014. Do we still have dinner ladies? Or teachers, you know, they have a role to play in supporting children to be as healthy as they possibly can. And, actually, I see them, Chair, as a really essential part of the public health workforce. Suzy, are you going to do your curriculum one? suzy davies am: Well, I've bound it in together, but that final point you make about teachers being part of the answer to this, they're already under a range of pressures: is it fair to make them accountable for whether this works or not? Or should that local leadership lie somewhere else? I don't expect you to pin down a person today. dr frank atherton: I wouldn't like to blame a teacher or performance manage them on the proportion of their children in their class who are overweight. That would clearly be nonsense, wouldn't it? But they are part of the solution, and so the accountability lies further up the chain, doesn't it? The question I think we would have, and public services boards might well ask, and the local education authorities may well ask, is: how effective is any particular school at driving forwards these healthy behaviours? suzy davies am: Okay, thank you. hefin david am: Is that all right, Chair? lynne neagle am: You've got the floor, Hefin. What would that look like? dr frank atherton: Just in terms of the physical activity, I have to say it's a really important dimension and we need to move further on. We know not enough of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It does have an impact on healthy weight, but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation, in terms of mental health issues, et cetera, you know. nathan cook: I'd just say that one thing we have got in train is, obviously, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales\u2014we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently. So, one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we're already delivering as well. hefin david am: With that in mind, I'm going to confess to you, chief medical officer, I did anything in school I could to avoid physical education lessons. Yet, two weeks ago, I played for the Assembly rugby team\u2014I wanted to get that in. How can we get children more engaged with physical education in ways that\u2014? I felt completely alienated in school. dr frank atherton: Well, you're right, and many people go through that same journey and come to physical activity later in life, and that's great if they do that. The sad reality is that many people don't, and we also know that there are issues around the dropping off, particularly for girls, of physical activity towards the teenage years. , at the heart of it, it's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people. Sometimes that's easier, I sense, for boys than for girls, but we need to tailor things to different audiences. hefin david am: Yes, that's the trick, isn't it? It's about finding out what children enjoy doing. It's not just about elite sports; it's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity. hefin david am: So, do you think, with that in mind, we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education? dr frank atherton: Again, I'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance. And finally, with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools, do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils? dr frank atherton: I don't have a personal view on that. I think it's the quality of the food that kids are getting, whether that comes from home or through school, and whether it's free or whether it's paid for. The question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level. I think that's a\u2014 hefin david am: So, you think that's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet. dr frank atherton: I think it's important that children have access to food, absolutely, if that's your question, but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what's in that food offer. I've been around some amazing schools in my own constituency, where they've got proper canteen facilities for pupils and really, really good produce in the meals. And, to be honest, I've been very surprised and shocked at what I've seen of the quality of the food in the packed lunches. Nobody can really police, and I wouldn't want to see parents being policed over what goes in a packed lunch, so if there is data out there to suggest that there's a larger percentage of parents providing packed lunched that are really not good at all, then there is some merit to be said for what Hefin is\u2014. Would you be willing to carry out any research? dr frank atherton: So, your point about food that's brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a route of guidance and prohibition, but that gets you into the role of nanny in chief and I don't really see that as my role or Government's role, and I don't think it's effective either. Do you remember\u2014? You must have seen on tv\u2014I think it was in Scotland; I don't know if it's happened in Wales\u2014parents pushing the fish and chip packets through the school railings. What I have seen, though, is some really good innovative practice in schools where, for example, they reward children for bringing the healthy options. Schools can give guidance to parents about what would be a healthy lunch and what sort of things might be expected to be seen in the lunch box. So, I've seen some of those approaches that have transformed, actually, the offer of what comes in school boxes. So, my point to the question was: isn't there some merit, perhaps, about all children being equal and eating similar good-quality food in schools? dr frank atherton: Yes. The draft plan commits, doesn't it, to updating the healthy eating in schools regulations\u2014the 2013 regulations? I appreciate this is a consultation, but what is it that needs changing in those regulations at the moment, just to give us a bit of steer? nathan cook: It's mainly on sugar content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is, you know, what we need to be careful of is unintended consequences of changing that, as well, if you see a shift to more kids bringing in school packed lunches as well. So, I think we want to consider the best way of doing that and consider through the consultation how we can go about it. janet finch-saunders am: The 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' plan commits to a review of the clinical obesity pathway. What are the time frames for this review, and what do you think are the basic essentials of a clinical obesity pathway for children and young people? dr frank atherton: We do have a pathway for managing overweight, and that's been in place since about 2010, I believe, and we do need to bring that up to date in terms of current knowledge and experiences. We've challenged Public Health Wales; we've asked Public Health Wales to undertake a review of that pathway, and they are going through that process now. nathan cook: We were asking them to review the pathway before we launch the final strategy in October because, obviously, what we want is for that to inform what that final strategy looks like. dr frank atherton: The second point of your question about what are the essential elements, they are already there; we need to tweak them and we need to make sure that they're properly delivered. But it's a tiered approach, so, having access to information through schools and through communities and into families is part of the first step of that. And then, if children are overweight, it's a question about how they're identified. There are questions about the ability of the public to recognise large children, so there may be an issue there. But when children are running into issues around weight, what kind of interventions can be put in, either through primary care or through communities through health visitors, et cetera? And then of course we do have\u2014and we've started to shine a light on this, haven't we\u2014the very overweight children. I don't think we have enough in the way of targeted support to be able to support those. So, I think there's something about looking at our whole pathway, mapping out what the current evidence now shows us is needed, and then thinking about what is our provision in Wales and what do we need to do to bring that up to the level of the places that are the best. The draft plan recognises the importance of the first 1,000 days, but it doesn't appear to include any new proposals to help parents to enable lifestyle changes. Are you satisfied that the draft plan does enough to address the influence that family and parents have on children's healthy weight behaviours, particularly in the first 1,000 days? dr frank atherton: Well, the first 1,000 days are really critically in shaping lives, as I'm sure you'd agree. We are absolutely open to any other suggestions that the public or this committee have as to what more we can and should do. There are a number of things, the sorts of programmes you've mentioned, that I think could be more effective. We know that children who are breastfed are less likely to suffer from obesity in childhood and, indeed, to go on to be obese adults. If there are other interventions in other areas that we need to take, then we'd be delighted to hear what they are, but those are the ones that have jumped out so far. nathan cook: Can I just say\u2014? One of the proposals we're looking for is, obviously, we know that during pregnancy it's a really critical time when we can actually look to work with mothers. We know from looking at some of the behaviour change that it's actually a really critical point when new mothers really start thinking about their lives, wanting the best for their child and their families. So, what we are thinking about is how we could develop some kind of approaches to that going forward. But we know our Healthy Start scheme is also a good lever for us, just in terms of how we can look to improve that kind of dietary offer at the earliest stage as well. Finally, we know that for some families day-to-day challenges can make it difficult for them to make healthy choices, particularly for those on lower incomes and/or maybe using food banks. Could the Welsh Government take bolder action to better support low-income families to eat healthily? dr frank atherton: Well, you've touched on a really important point about inequalities because overweight and obesity is not evenly distributed across our population. It absolutely is more prevalent in more socioeconomically deprived communities, and that's something that should really concern us all. So, it gets you to questions of availability of fresh food and produce; it gets you to questions of formulation of products and whether value brands are less healthy than more premium brands. So, it cuts across all of those issues that we talked about in terms of settings and in terms of environment earlier. We do need to think in broad terms\u2014broader terms than just obesity, but we do need to think in broad terms\u2014about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets you to really important questions about the minimum wage and income poverty. There's no doubt in my mind\u2014I'm a public health professional\u2014and there's no doubt in my mind that economic success and health success go hand in hand. In terms of what we can do through this particular consultation, there are some things in there about providing better access, but without tackling some of those deeper determinants of health, their impact will necessarily be limited. lynne neagle am: Just finally from me, then, you referred earlier to the importance of making every contact count, but some stakeholders have told the committee that they struggle to do that because of difficulties in availability of people to refer to. Is that a situation that you recognise and what, really, can we do to improve that situation? dr frank atherton: Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. What we're seeing across the NHS is a gradual transformation in primary care so that primary care is no longer about going to see your GP, it's about going to see a practice where you have a range of health professionals. Would I like to see more dietetic support, for example, in that setting? Absolutely I would. I think we need to think in terms of that pathway that we were talking about earlier, about access to that kind of advice and support, which can head off people getting into problems and kids getting into problems with weight issues. So, that question of redesign of the pathway really speaks to, I think, your point about, 'Well, where do people go when they have problems with their weight?' That's true for adults and it's true for children as well. Well, can I thank you both very much for your attendance? It's been a really productive session. Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the committee, because getting some input into the consultation from children's perspectives, this would be one of the routes we would absolutely welcome.

I've also made notes of the previous meeting and  I was about to send them you but then  I had to go to this  meeting so you will get them too  marketing: project manager: Then I hope you all have  worked out some some  some some presentations about  about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .  then I will  bring in some some some new requirements I I got  from the  account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . project manager: and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the marketing:  . industrial designer: You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? project manager: Yes  well yes w who are we going to  to well to sell this , marketing:  . So And then  we will close this meeting  user interface: project manager: and after this meeting we'll  we'll have a lunch . Maybe  why  Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? marketing: No , I don't . project manager:  you want a table to to  marketing: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . project manager: Yes yes maybe maybe you can  can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary  . Well I've just been  presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . It's probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it .  seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . project manager: Do you Do you have this  information on the web page you said ? marketing: I have an a web page yes . So basically  there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control .  , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times  and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Teletext is used  fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . marketing: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that  fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . industrial designer: marketing: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . industrial designer: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's marketing: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . industrial designer: Not enough marketing: I don't know how we'd go about combating that . What do you mean there ? marketing: For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury . project manager: But it's it's the opinion of the  of the users huh ? marketing: Yeah . marketing:  and then it's got a demographic breakdown on industrial designer: Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the marketing:  I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . user interface: You can disconnect it there project manager: You can maybe just just user interface: no ? marketing: Oh no , yeah . industrial designer: Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional  user interface: Oh yeah . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . industrial designer: Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the  both yeah user interface and functional design . marketing: One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute . industrial designer: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint  our design based on what is more important . industrial designer: Speech recognition in marketing: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . industrial designer: So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control marketing: Well potentially yeah ,  project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it would be all based on speech . project manager: Well it would it would be a solution for  when your remote control is lost , marketing: project manager:  when it has speech recognition then  i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . industrial designer: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? user interface: Oh . Well , it depends you know like there is  it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , project manager:  . project manager: Yes , user interface: It's it's going to be li project manager: that that that that's  . user interface: it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case project manager: Do you have some more important facts user interface: but it's but I don't know with twenty fi marketing:  project manager: or can we go to the next presentation ? industrial designer: Okay . So marketing: Well industrial designer: you had to to to summarise maybe the marketing: This is now talking about  who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it ,  . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five ,  twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . marketing: Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , user interface: project manager:  . industrial designer: I thi You us marketing: It'll be in a different window , yep . marketing: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .  I okay project manager: Oh , industrial designer: I stay project manager: this is user interface: Now you can move I think yeah . user interface: It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , marketing: Sorry ? Oh .  I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very  technical background  what is it because I think in the product it is important . industrial designer: So basically  the basic function of a remote control is to send  messages to another system that is fixed . industrial designer: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually  through a  infrared bit marketing: So my method for  designing the yeah the work design  yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional  capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . industrial designer: So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing  Expert  Anna marketing: industrial designer: and  w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions  for this remote control and I show you the the working design .  we want an on off button , it can be  it's simple but it's it's important , and also  the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , marketing:  . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is  will be to well my aim would be to  design the and choose the chips and the infrared  components to build the remote control marketing: This is very quick  design ,  you stop me or interrupt me if  you don't agree on it on that . industrial designer: And  so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this  schema marketing: Well . industrial designer: that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me marketing: You drew it a long time ago ? industrial designer: you know . industrial designer: And  that's it so I won't go into details about that project manager: overwhelming . So project manager: are they cheap , or are they  reliable ? What were your industrial designer: found and yeah th you have always a compromise with  reliability and  i if it's expensive , project manager:  . industrial designer: but  this one was not this one also really  reliable  so yeah that's it for the working design ,  I hope you get clearer view on  what what a remote control is  in terms of  technical components project manager: Yes . industrial designer: but maybe yeah project manager: So user interface: But is it  can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma industrial designer: No no no no we we will  This is a preference but we can always change  project manager: What I w what I was thinking about  the the the schema  about  the sender and the receiver ,  can you can you get back to it ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah  , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not  able to change it . We will use  infrared protocol  using yeah infrared and  and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists project manager: industrial designer: and but we what we can do is   adapting the the chips inside  to the best  chips and  infrared bubbles . Of course yeah user interface: But you should be careful , industrial designer: in the chip you have it yeah . user interface: people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote    which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . user interface: So maybe we should think of marketing: industrial designer: Of course yeah we should take that into account marketing: That's handy . project manager: Yeah yes marketing: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . industrial designer: in the  user interface: Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away industrial designer: user interface: You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . project manager: I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this  th these things . So  I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , marketing: user interface: so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that  basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have  keys or buttons with which people can  press and then  changing a button will basically  change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and   industrial designer: So p as  Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is  s a question which will we have to see later . user interface: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . user interface: And  so generally  I don't have some figures sorry but  so there are two kinds of  remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play ,  volume change and  keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now   even the one  on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but   . Then there is  this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing ,  which which you can vouch . And then you have  what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop  and then you play the movie or  or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those marketing: And then well personal preferences I would  basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the  the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because  some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that  we could  aim for the like in the f coming future  that type of  applications with marketing: Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , user interface: marketing: so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , user interface: Yeah . marketing: so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: or does it know which one you want to use ? user interface:  actually  you could you could think of  having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing marketing: user interface: but   yo you you you still can't  in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option marketing: user interface: and you could play it or You can also think about having like  I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate  sitting setup box marketing: user interface: and  you have   something like   you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you marketing: user interface: and  you can just you know  when you come back you could just switch on that thing and  watch a program . user interface: In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . user interface: It's the next generation thing , project manager:  yes , user interface: but it is going to come in couple of years . project manager: but I think it's i i it's already there , user interface: It's goi project manager:  the hard disk  recorders  I I've seen them in the shop . user interface: it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both   video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . That's , user interface: No no we are not making a universal remote , marketing: yeah . user interface: we are just looking at  giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box marketing:  . user interface: which is going to sit there and  it's going to do that job for me . Because y project manager: W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . project manager: Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible  future p  prospects marketing:  . So we can always discuss about it for example  the presently the video market actually  this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually industrial designer: user interface: so it i like people are providing like  things like   movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and  your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . user interface: and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . industrial designer: Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed  online  yeah . user interface: Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie marketing:  . project manager: I have  received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and  I would like to share them with you . project manager: first thing is  teletext is a well known feature of televisions marketing: Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent  prominent  place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . project manager:  as  a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . project manager: further yes we must think ,  do we stay  to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back  huh , or do we   go further as Matthew indicated by supporting   recording  devices ? user interface: marketing: So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? project manager:  indeed indeed .  , furthermore , w we need really need to interest  y younger customers and then with younger customers  people  below the age of forty , marketing: project manager: So industrial designer: So project manager: that's to that's  there's a market but  they will grow older older marketing: project manager: and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . project manager:  therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be  have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . user interface: Yeah it's  well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , marketing: user interface: but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys marketing:  . user interface: you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and  basically   so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually industrial designer: But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , user interface: Yeah so . Yes yes marketing: that's the the the  the new and the funky things , project manager: mo industrial designer: Because they are already used to that , you know , product . marketing: that's , project manager: Yes it's recognisable industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . So , for example you have  presently  keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and   four five six like that and  you can have keys like this in form like  keys like that project manager: Mael can you hand me over this  ? industrial designer: Yes . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? project manager:  well marketing: 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all project manager: I think fi five min user interface: Forty minutes ? marketing: and it's a very important issue . too sorry , so we basically don't change the  original order of them industrial designer: user interface: but then the keys are more spacious , marketing: user interface: they don't look  so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three ,  four , sorry four here  five and six , marketing:  . user interface: so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice industrial designer: user interface: but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to project manager: Okay . industrial designer: marketing: basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control user interface: Yeah . marketing: wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? user interface: project manager: Of course they have already one . marketing: 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . I well I think many people said  in your in in your research    the appearance of the  R_C_ is is important when they are buying one marketing:  . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . marketing: In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . project manager: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance marketing: Well , we can't , with the price range . project manager: What do What do you think about What componen industrial designer: Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros  per  per R_ s R_C_ marketing:  . industrial designer: and I think  with this now you know that chips are very  cheaps marketing: If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that industrial designer: that's marketing: which would drive the cost up a lot . industrial designer: Ye project manager: Is the L_C_D_ screen marketing: For universal remotes industrial designer: I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term . project manager: I think thi this could be this could be a market because  universal remote controls  tend to be  quite expensive . marketing: And quite complicated to use , project manager: S so we can try to go in between , marketing: yes . project manager: but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal   R_C_ industrial designer: Universal . project manager: marketing: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . project manager:  yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know . project manager: I think  when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . project manager: So d Do you agree ? user interface: Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is  not too expensive . industrial designer: Yeah user interface:  and it d  Our provin industrial designer: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell  four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers  the price of a chip is  price of a chip is very cheap . industrial designer: So I'm okay for designing  a ne  less yeah a a kind of universal  R_C_ yeah . And  basically you can look to the standards of other industrial designer: Yeah that's needed , yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . marketing: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . user interface: Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . project manager: So given we are going for this   universal type  m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific  user interface content industrial designer: Yes . project manager: and  maybe you can look on on what trends are in this  in this type of market . user interface: and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good marketing: project manager: W yes , user interface: for the project manager: we  we can have lunch now . project manager: So  Then th th the next meeting will  user interface: Yeah so we meet in well what are our project manager: after lunch you have  we have  thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting "

        "Query": "What is the problem related to feasibility?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager proposed the idea of adding an LCD display screen to the remote control, allowing for different pages for different devices. However, due to budget constraints of twenty-five per unit, they decided to be realistic and stick to the budget.",
        "Article": "So , before we get started with the , technical part , I just want to review what I think is happening with the our data collection . Th - this this is s should be im it isn't There 's another thing going on of gathering data , and that 's pretty much independent of this . What we think is gonna happen is that , in parallel starting about now we 're gonna get Fey to , where you 're working with me and Robert , draft a note that we 're gonna send out to various CogSci c and other classes saying , \" here 's an opportunity to be a subject . \" And then there 'll be a certain number of  , hours during the week which she will be available and we 'll bring in people .  , roughly how many , Robert ? We d Do we know ? grad c: fifty was our sort of our first professor b: OK . So , we 're looking for a total of fifty people , not necessarily by any means all students but we 'll s we 'll start with with that . And , so , I guess there 's a plan to have a meeting Friday afternoon  , with  , Jane , and maybe Liz and whoever , on actually getting the script worked out . But what I 'd like to do , if it 's O K , is to s to , as I say , start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week . The week after that 's Spring Break , and maybe we 'll look for them some subjects next door grad c: Yeah . Also , F both Fey and I will , do something of which I may , eh kindly ask you to to do the same thing , which is we gonna check out our social infrastructures for possible subjects . So , if you happen to be sort of in a non - student social setting , and you know people who may be interested in being subjects We also considered using the Berkeley High School and their teachers , maybe , and get them interested in stuff . But I I will just make a first draft of the , note , the \" write - up \" note , send it to you and Fey and then professor b: And why don't you also copy Jane on it ? grad c: And , Are we Have we concurred that , these these forms are sufficient for us , and necessary ? professor b: th I think they 're necessary . professor b: and I think we 're just gonna use it as it is , and  grad c: N . There 's one tricky part about , they have the right  I The last paragraph \" if you agree to participate you have the opportunity to have anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . \" OK ? Now that , we had to be included for this other one which might have , meetings , you know , about something .  , so what I 'd like to do is also have our subjects sign a waiver saying \" I don't want to see the final transcript \" . professor b: And if they don't If they say \" no , I 'm not willing to sign that \" , then we 'll show them the final transcript . professor b: That ,  yeah , so we might actually ,  S i Jane may say that , \" you know , you can't do this \" , \" on the same form , we need a separate form . I 'd I 'd I 'd like to , e e  , add an a little thi eh a thing for them to initial , saying \" nah , do I don't want to see the final transcript . professor b: But other than that , that 's one 's been approved , this really is the same project , rec you know . grad c: And ,  and now it 's We have a complete English parser that does everything the German parser does . grad e: What did you end up having to do ?  , wha Was there anything interesting about it at all ? grad c: Well , if you , eh grad d: We 'll show you . professor b: Yeah , we can show us , grad e: or are we gonna see that ? professor b: right ? grad c: Well , w w We d The first we did is we we tried to to do change the the \" laufen \" into \" run \" , or \" running \" , or \" runs \" . grad c: So this sentence sentence is parses the p the same output , grad e:  . grad c: If if you 'd add add Today and Evening , it 'll add Time or not . grad e: And the t and the time , right ? grad c: So it i it does look at that . grad c: But all the rest is p simply frosting on the cake , and it 's optional for that parser . professor b: So , you can sho You you Are are you gonna show us the little templates ? grad c: And grad e: S grad c: Yeah . I I also have it running here , grad e: The former end g \" Oh , I see . grad c: so if I do this now , you can see that it parsed the wonderful English sentence , \" Which films are on the cinema today evening ? \" But ,  . professor b: No i grad c: It could be \" this evening , which which films are on the cinema \" , or \" running in the cinema , which \"  , \" today evening \" ,  i \" Is anything happening in the cinema this evening ? \" grad e: OK . professor b: Well grad c: Ge - elaborate , or , more or less ,  professor b: Actually , it 's a little tricky , in that there 's some allowable German orders which aren't allowable English orders and so forth . So it it doe I it These u these optional elements , grad c: It is not professor b: it 's it 's actually a set , not a sequence ? grad c: Yeah . We were I was afraid that ,  professor b: Oh ! grad e: So it really is key word matching , basically . What 's an idiomatic of phrasing this ? Which films are showing ? grad d: Are pl playing at the cinema ? grad c: playing ? grad d: Yeah . grad e: Tonight ? grad d: I changed that file , actually , where it 's on my account . grad e: This this evening ? phd f: Actually , you would say , \" which films are on tonight ? \" grad d: You want to get it ? Or is di was it easy to get it ? grad c:  . grad c: Except that we d w we don't have this , time information here now , which is ,  Oh . And ,  you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate , right ? grad d: Yeah ,  I changed those sentences to make it , more , idiomatic . And , of course , you can have i many variations in those sentences , they will still parse fine . So , if you want to look at the templates , they 're conveniently located in a file , \" template \" . I had to change , @ @ \" Spielfilm \" to \" film \" , \" Film \" to \" movie \" , cinem \" Kino \" to \" cinema \" to \" today \" heu \" heute \" to \" today \" , grad e: Huh . grad c: evening \" Abend \" to \" evening \" professor b: Capitalized as well grad a:  . professor b: Y i grad d: One thing I was wondering , was , those functions there , are those things that modify the M - three - L basically ? grad c: Yep . grad c: And that 's that 's the next step , professor b: p grad c: but we 'll get to that in a second . professor b: So so , the point is , if it says \" this \" and \" see \" , it also will work in \" see \" and \" this \" ? grad e: S professor b: In the other order ? grad c: Yeah . professor b: with those two key words ? grad c: Should we try it ? professor b: \" This is the one I want to see \" or whatever . grad c: It 's correct , but I don't know where it gets it from . grad d:  it 's sort of grad c: And \" see this \" is exactly the same thing . grad d: One thing I was wondering was , those percentage signs , right ? So , why do we even have them ? grad c: Yep . grad d: Because if you didn't have them grad c: I 'll tell you why . grad c: And the value of the score is , v I assume , I guess , the more of these optional things that are actually in there , the higher the r score it is .  , let 's hope that the generation will not be more difficult , even though the generator is a little bit more complex .  but we 'll Mmm , that means we may need two hours and twenty minutes rather than an hour ten minutes , professor b: Alright . grad c: And the next thing I would like to be able to do , and it seems like this would not be too difficult either , is to say , \" OK let 's now pretend we actually wanted to not only change the the mapping of of , words to the M - three - L but we also wanted to change add a new sentence type and and make up some some new M - three - L s \" professor b: Yep . And , grad d: So , that 's grad c: that 's shouldn't be too tough . Yeah , so where are those those functions \" Action \" , \" Goodbye \" , and so on , right ? Are they actually , Are they going to be called ?  , are they present in the code for the parser ? grad c: Yeah . So what it probably does , is it takes the ,  Is this where it is ? This is already the XML stuff ? This is where it takes its own , syntax , and converts it somehow . Where is the  grad d: What are you looking for ? grad c: where it actually produces the the XML out of the , parsed stuff . You mean , where the where the act how the action \" Goodbye \" maps into something grad d: Yeah . So when it encounts encounters \" Day \" , it will , activate those h classes in the in the XML stuff But ,  I saw those actions  , the \" Goodbye \" stuff somewhere . So whatever n this does  this is , basically , looks l to me like a function call , right ? professor b:  ? Oh , yeah . grad c: And ,  So , whenever it it encounters \" Goodbye \" , which we can make it do in a second , here grad a: That function automatically generates an initialized XML structure ? grad c: I grad d: I think each of those functions act on the current XML structure , and change it in some way , for example , by adding a a l a field to it , or something . professor b: cause some of them there were other actions  , that that s seemed to step state variables somewhere , grad d: Right . professor b: and confirm that it 's grad c: W we  -  grad d: Oh , you mean that 's not going to actually modify the tree , professor b: I think that 's right . grad c: e mmm  , well i There is a feature called \" Discourse - Status \" , grad d: When there 's a feature . grad c: And so whenever I just say , \" Write \" , it will it will put this in here . professor b: Oh , so it always just Is it So it Well , go back , then , cuz it may be that all those th things , while they look like function calls , are just a way of adding exactly that to the XML . grad c: So , this professor b: e I 'm not sure e that grad c:  well , we we 'll see , when we say , let 's test something , \" Goodbye \" , causes it to c to create basically an \" Action Goodbye - End - Action \" . grad c: Now , if we know that \" Write \" produces a \" Feature Discourse - Status Confirm Discourse - Status \" . But there is some kind of function call , because how does it know to put Goodbye in Content , but , Confirm in Features ? grad c: Oh . It d it n That 's because grad d: So So , it 's not just that it 's adding that field . professor b: It 's it 's the It 's under what sub - type you 're doing it . grad c: Well , sometimes it m Sometimes , i grad d: Well , they 're defined somewhere , presumably . grad c: it grad a: Well , it just automatically initializes things that are common , right ? professor b:  grad a: So it 's just a shorthand . And there is , here , a reference So , this tells us that whatever is has the ID \" zero \" is referenced here by @ @ the restriction seed and this is exa \" I want \" What was the sentence ? professor b: \" I want two seats here . Here , we change and so , we Here we add something to the Discourse - Status , that the user wants to change something that was sort of done before And ,  and that , whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema . grad a: So then , whatever takes this M - three - L is what actually changes the state , not the Yeah , OK . I definitely think it 's It 's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that isn't there . grad c:  ? professor b:  Disc grad c: Sort of get a complete understanding of the whole thing . Then the next thing we talked about is actually , figuring out how to add our own tags , and stuff like that . So , this is  , what I got today is the the new  M - three - L for  , the Maps , professor b: Yep . grad c: and with some examples So , this is the XML and this is sort of what it will look like later on , even though it you can't see it on on this resolution . And this is what it sort of is the the structure of Map requests ,  also not very interesting , and here is the more interesting stuff for us , is the routes , route elements , and , again , as we thought it 's really simple . We have @ @ simple \" from objects \" and \" to objects \" and so forth , points of interest along the way And , I asked them whether or not we could ,  First of all , I was little bit It seemed to me that this m way of doing it is sort of a stack a step backwards from the way we 've done it before . professor b: S grad c: So these are these are professor b: So these are these are your friends back at EML . There 's there 's not seven committees , or anything , right ? grad c: No . And every every element of that e r r f of that Every segment we call a \" route element \" . And so , from A to B we cut up in three different steps , and every step has a \" from object \" where you start , a \" to object \" where y where you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way . What w I was sort of missing here , and  , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , I didn't sort of get the the notion of the global goal of the whole route . And I suggested that they should n be k  , kind enough to do s two things for us , is one , Also allocating , some tags for our Action Schema Enter - Vista - Approach , and And also , since you had suggested that that , we figure out if we ever , for a demo reason , wanted to shortcut directly to the g GIS and the Planner , of how we can do it . Now , what 's the state of the art of getting to entrances , what 's the syntax for that , how get getting to vista points and calculating those on the spot . Wherever you 'll find a route planner it n does nothing but get to the closest point where the street network is at minimal distance to the geometric center . Let ,  I want a a Again , outside of m almost managerial point ,  You 're in the midst of this , so you know better . But it seems to me it 's probably a good idea to li  minimize the number of  , change requests we make of them . Does this does this make sense to you guys ? It  you 're you 're doing the the interaction but it seemed to me that what we ought to do is come up with a  , something where you ,  And I I don't know who 's mok working most closely on it .  , take what they have , send it to everybody saying \" this is what they have , this is what we think we should add \" , OK ? and then have a d a an iteration within our group saying \"  , well \" OK ? And get our best idea of what we should add . Is i or , I don't know does this make sense to you ? Or grad c: Yeah . Especially if we want Sort of , what I my feeling was eh we we sort of reserved something that has a r eh an OK label . grad c: I w No matter how we want to call it , this is sort of our playground . grad c: And if we get something in there that is a structure elaborate and and and and and complex enough to to to maybe enable a whole simulation , one of these days , that would be u the the perfect goal . What are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ? How how would we try to characterize those and what do we want to request now that 's leave enough space to do all that stuff ? grad c:   professor b: And so that sounds like a great thing to do as the priority item  , as soon as we can do it . professor b: So y so you guys will send to the rest of us  a version of  , this , and the  , description grad a: With sugge yeah , suggested improvements and professor b: Well b Yeah . So , the the  Not everyone  , reads German , so if you 'd  grad a: Mmm . Then , with some sug s suggestions about where where do we go from here ? grad a: OK . But for the moment just  , t for this class of of things , we might want to try to encompass . This is this is everything that that , you know ,  we might want to do in the next couple years . So I just this XML stuff here just has to do with Source - Path - Goal type stuff , in terms of traveling through Heidelberg . grad a: So , but this O Is the domain greater than that ? professor b: No . It 's beyond Source - Path - Goal , but I think we don't need to get beyond it @ @ tourists in Heidelberg . professor b: It seems to me we can get all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of tourists in Heidelberg . OK ? But you know , i depending on what people are interested in , one could have , tours , one could have  , explanations of why something is is , you know , why why was this done , or  , no there 's no end to the complexity you can build into the  , what a tourist in Heidelberg might ask . professor b: So , at least unless somebody else wants t to suggest otherwise I think the general domain we don't have t to  , broaden . And if there 's something somebody comes up with that can't be done that way , then , sure . W we 'll we 'll look at that , but  I 'd be s I I 'd be surprised at if there 's any important issue that that And ,   if if you want to  , push us into reference problems , that would be great . professor b: and you know , what what are these things referring to ? Not only anaphora , but , more generally the ,  this whole issue of , referring expressions , and , what is it that they 're actually dealing with in the world ? grad c:   professor b: And , again , this is li in the databa this is also pretty well formed because there is an ontology , and the database , and stuff . professor b: There aren't really deep mysteries about  , what w what things the system knows about . professor b: And a l and a lot and and anaphora , and pronouns , grad c: Nuh . grad c: Now , we hav the the whole Unfortunately , the whole database is , in German . We have just commissioned someone to translate some bits of it , IE the e the shortest k the the more general descriptions of all the objects and , persons and events . But did y I  I think there will be great because the reference problem really is not trivial , even if you have such a g well - defined world . grad a: Could you give me an example of a reference problem ? so so l I can make it more concrete ? grad c: Well How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? We sort of t think that our bit in this problem is interesting , but , just to get from Powder - Tower to an object I ID in a database is also not really trivial . phd f: Or or if you take something even more scary , \" how do I get to the third building after the Tower ? the Ple - Powder - Tower ? \" grad a: Mmm . Or , you know , the church across from City Hall , or grad a: Or the re the restaurant where they wear lederhosen ? grad c: Or the phd f: Right . grad c: O or or tower , or this tower , or that building , or phd f: Right . Trying to professor b: Or you can say \" how \" you know , \" how do I get back ? \" grad a: Yeah , yeah . And , again , it 's just a question of which of these things , people want to dive into . What , I think I 'm gonna try to do , and I guess , pwww ! let 's say that by the end of spring break , I 'll try to come up with some general story about , construction grammar , and what constructions we 'd use and how all this might fit together . grad c: u u u u That 's what strikes me , that we sort of the de g  , small Something , maybe we should address one of these days , is to That most of the work people actually always do is look at some statements , and and analyze those . grad c: But the whole i is it is it really relevant that we are dealing mostly with , sort of , questions ? professor b: Oh , yeah ? grad c: you know professor b: Well ,  yeah , I d grad c: And this is It seems to me that we should maybe at least spend a session or or brainstorm a little bit about whether that l this is special case in that sense . You know Did we ever find m metaphorical use in in questions in in that sense , really ? professor b: Yeah . grad c: \" Who got kicked out of France ? \" phd f: Muh professor b: Yeah , or , you know . \" Wh - why is he why is he pushing for promotion ? \" grad c: Nuh . professor b: er , just pick pick any of them and just do the eh grad c:   professor b: So I don't I don't think , it 's at all difficult  , to convert them to question forms that really exist and people say all the time ,  And sort of we don't know how to handle them , too . Right ?  , it 's I d It We don't know how to handle the declarative forms , @ @ really , and , then , the interrogative forms , ah - oh . grad d: Ooo ! professor b: Nancy , it looked like you were s grad e: Oh . it 's just that that the goals are g very different to cases So we had this problem last year when we first thought about this domain , actually , was that most of the things we talked about are our story understanding . grad e: we 're gonna have a short discourse and the person talking is trying to , I don't know , give you a statement and tell you something . And here , it 's th grad c: Help you create a mental model , blah - blah - blah . grad e: And then here , y you are j  , the person is getting information and they or may not be following some larger plan , you know , that we have to recognize or , you know , infer . And th th the their discourse patterns probably don't follo follow quite as many logical connec professor b: Right . No , I think that 's one of things that 's interesting , is is in this sort of over - arching story we we worked it out for th as you say , this the storytelling scenario . Cuz for a while we were thinking , \" well , how can we change the , data to sort of illicit tha illicit , actions that are more like what we are used to ? \" But obviously we would rather , you know , try to figure out what 's what 's , you know professor b: Well , I don't know .  , maybe maybe that 's what we 'll do is is s u e We can do anything we want with it . professor b: OK , and the one for next  , summer is just half done and then the other half is this , \" generation thing \" which we think isn't much different . professor b: So once that 's done , then all the rest of it is , sort of , you know , what we want to do for the research . And we can w we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their framework at all . professor b: If we can use all the , execution engines , then we can , you know , really try things that would be too too much pain to do ourselves . So , if we want to turn it into u understan standing stories about Heidelberg , we can do that .  , that would just be a t a  grad c: Or , as a matter of fact , we need and if we if we ' r eh take a ten year perspective , we need to do that , because w e w a Assuming we have this , we we ta in that case we actually do have these wonderful stories , and historical anecdotes , professor b: Yeah . So , th the database is huge , and if we want to answer a question on that , we actually have to go one step before that , and understand that . grad c: And so , this has been a a a Deep Map research issue that was is is part of the unresolved , and to - do 's , and something for the future , is how can we sort of run our our text , our content , through a machine that will enable us , later , to retrieve or answer e questions more sensibly ? phd f: Mwa   S Who 's going ? phd f: So ,  So , I was just going to ask , so , what is the the basic thing that that you are , obligated to do , by the summer before w  y c we can move professor b: Ah ! OK . So , what happened is , there 's this , eh ,  Robert was describing the There 's two packages there 's a , quote parser , there 's a particular piece of this big system , which , in German , takes these t sentence templates and produces XML structures . professor b: The other thing is , at the other end , roughly at the same level , there 's something that takes , X M L structures , produces an output XML structure which is instructions for the generator . professor b: OK ? And then there 's a language generator , and then after that a s a synthesizer that goes from an XML structure to , language generation , to actual specifications for a synthesizer . Eh , but again , there 's one module in which there 's one piece that we have to convert to English . And that But as I say , this is all along was viewed as a kind of a m a minor thing , necessary , but but not phd f: Right . professor b: And much more interesting is the fact that , as part of doing this , we we are , you know , inheriting this system that does all sort of these other things . professor b: Not precisely what we want , and that 's that 's wh where it it gets difficult . So , e enough of that , but I , mmm , the e sort of , Johno and I will take up that responsibility , and , get a first draft of that . grad c: y you guys sort of started fighting , on the Bayes - net \" Noisy - OR \" front ? grad d:  . Yeah , I thought I should , talk a little bit about that , because that might be a good , sort of architecture to have , in general for , problems with , you know , multiple inputs to a node . And what 's the other one ? so that just we know what the d agenda is ? grad c: the Wu paper , I think maybe professor b: Oh , yeah .  , so I I 've been in contact with Wu , so , probably let 's put that off till I I till I understand better , what he 's doing . It 's just a little embarrassing cause all this was in his thesis and I was on his thesis committee , and , so , I r really knew this at one time . professor b: But , I I It 's not only  Is Part of what I haven't figured out yet is is how all this goes together . professor b: squealing sound ? grad d: Or shall I just use this ? professor b: It 's probably just as easy . grad d: Hey ! grad a: I was envying you and your pocket cause I don't have one . grad e: It was a quick one , huh ? professor b: That 's why they invented \" pocket T 's \" . grad d: So ,  Recall that , we want to have this kind of structure in our Bayes - nets . Namely , that ,  You have these nodes that have several bands , right ? So Does  , they sort of the typical example is that , these are all a bunch of cues for something , and this is a certain effect that we 'd like to conclude . So ,  Like , let 's just look at the case when , this is actually the the final action , right ? So this is like , you know , touch , grad c: Y grad d: or grad c: E - EVA grad d: Sorry .  grad c:  grad d: Yeah , E - EVA , right ? grad c: Yeah . grad d: Enter , V View , Approach , right ? phd f: W what was this ? It i i i ehhh , i ehhh . professor b: Wri - write it out for for grad d: So , this is Yeah . So , we 'd like to take all these various cues , right ? phd f: Like the army . grad d: So this one might be , say ,  grad e: New terminology ? phd f: Yeah . grad c:  ? grad d: Well , let me pick a random one grad e: I haven't heard that before . grad d: and say ,  I don't know , it could be , like This isn't the way it really is , but let me say that , suppose someone mentioned , admission fees Ah , it takes too long . If the thing is a landmark , you know ,  then there 's another thing that says if  if it 's closed or not , at the moment . Right ? And the , problem that we were having was that , you know , given N - nodes , there 's \" two to the N \" Given N - nodes , and furthermore , the fact that there 's three things here , we need to specify \" three times \" , \" two to the N \" probabilities . For example , they could be \" time of day \" , in which case we could , say , you know , \" Morning , afternoon , evening , night \" . And , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain .  Where should I put this ? So , the idea is that , Let 's call these , C - one , C - two , C - three , and C - four , and E , for Cause and Effect , I guess . Well , actually , the idea , first of all , is that each of these things has a quote - unquote distinguished state , which means that this is the state in which we don't really know anything about it . So right ? So , for example , if we don't really know if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state . It 's a really , you know , if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee , you know , if they didn't talk about it , that would be the Distinguish state . grad c: S so , this is a fanciful way of saying \" default \" ? grad d: So Yeah , yeah . grad d: So , the idea is that , you have these intermediate nodes , right ? E - one , E - two , E - three and E - four ? professor b: So , this is the Heckerman paper you 're working with ? Good . So The idea is that , each of these EI is represents what this would be if all the other ones were in the distinguish state . Right ? So , for example , suppose that the person  , suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark . Then , this would be W The this would just represent the probability distribution of this , assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ? So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then this would represent the probability distribution . So maybe in this case Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that , if the thing 's a landmark and we don't know anything else , then we 're gonna conclude that ,  They want to view it with probability , you know , point four . They want to enter it with probability ,  with probability point five and they want to approach it probability point one , say Right ? So we come up with these l little tables for each of those OK . And the final thing is that ,  this is a deterministic function of these , so we don't need to specify any probabilities . We just have to , say what function this is , right ? So we can let this be ,  G of E - one comma E - two . The important point is that  There is a a a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full CPT . And So I gave eh Bhaskara a copy of this , eh sort of \" ninety - two \" paper . professor b: So , I u w  , yo  you Have you read it yet ? grad d: you can Yeah , you should take a look at it , I guess . professor b: And  One of the questions just come at Bhaskara is , \" How much of this does JavaBayes support ? \" grad d: Yeah , it 's a good question . grad d: And ,  In a sense it sup we can make it supported by , manually , entering , you know , probabilities that are one and zeros , right ? professor b: Right . So the little handout that The little thing that I sent I sent a message saying , here is a way to take One thing you could do , which is kind of s in a way , stupid , is take this deterministic function , and use it to build the CPT . So , if Ba - JavaBayes won't do it for you , grad c: Mmm .  and , what I sent out about a week ago , was an idea of how to do that , for , evidence combination . So one of one function that you could use as your \" G function \" is an e e Evidence - Combining . So you just take the  , if each of th if each of the ones has its own little table like that , then you could take the , strength of each of those , times its little table , and you 'd add up the total evidence for \" V \" , \" E \" , and \" A \" . professor b: I i i No , no But I 'm saying is There There is a w  , if y if if you decide what 's what is appropriate , is probablistic evidence combination , you can write a function that does it . It 's a pui it 's actually one of the examples he 's got in there . But , anyway , s skipping skipping the question of exactly which functions now is it clear that you might like to be able to shortcut the whole conditional probability table . grad c: in some it seems very plausible in some sense , where we will be likely to not be observe some of the stuff . That 's one of the problems , is , W Is is , Where would th Where would it all come from ? grad c: Yeah . grad d: What ? grad c: I if it 's a a a discar Discourse Initial Phrase , we will have nothing in the discourse history . A are you saying that we 'll not be able to observe certain nodes ? That 's fine . The f the the the Bayes - nets in general are quite good at saying , \" if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that . So , if you don't have any information about the discourse , you just use your priors of of whatever eh the discourse  , eh , basically whatever w it 's Probabilistically , whatever it would be . But the other problem is , how do you fill in all these numbers ? And I think that 's the one he was getting at . So , specifically in this case you have to f have this many numbers , grad e: Yeah . grad d: whereas in this case you just have to have three for this , three for this , three for this . grad d: So you have to have just three N ? So , this is much smaller than that . professor b:  grad e: So , you don't need da data enough to cover  , nearly as much stuff . grad a: So , really , i What a A Noisy - OR seems to kind of \" neural - net - acize \" these Bayes - nets ? professor b: Eh well to some No , no . So , \" Noisy - OR \" is a funny way of referring to this , because the Noisy - OR is only one instance . So Eh  grad a: Well , my point was more that we just eh With the neural net , right , eh , things come in , you have a function that combines them and professor b: Yeah , it it Tha - that 's true . It is a is also more neural - net - like , although  , it isn't necessarily sum  , s you know , sum of weights or anything like that . professor b:  i You could have , like the Noisy - OR function , really is one that 's essentially says , take the max . So And , I thi I think that 's the standard way people get around the  There are a couple other ones . But ,  The I think we definitely I think it 's a great idea tha to to pursue that . It  you you can always  see easily that that I 'm not grasping everything correctly , but what seemed attractive to me in im  in the last discussion we had , was that we find out a means of of getting these point four , point five , point one , of C - four , not because , you know , A is a Landmark or not , but we we we label this whatever object type , and if it 's a garden , it 's point three , point four , point two . If it 's , a town hall , it 's point two , point three , point five . And we don't want to write this down necessarily every time for something but ,  let 's see . grad d: It 'll be students Where else would it be stored ? That 's the question . So , i is Well , let me say something , guys , cuz there 's not There 's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now . professor b: So that  , if you know about it let 's say , a particular town hall that , it 's one that is a monument , then , that would be stored there . If you don't , you look up the hierarchy , Eh so , you you you may or So , then you 'd have this little vector of , you know , Approach Mode or EVA Mode . professor b: or , link to or but but in any case i View it logically as being in the ontology . professor b: And , if yo As I say , if you know about a specific object , you put it there . So , when we get to Wu , The - e We 'll see w what he says about that . professor b: And , then if you If it isn't there , it 's higher , and if you don't know anything except that it 's a b it 's it 's a building , then up at the highest thing , you have the pr what amounts to a prior . If you don't know anything else about a building , you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level , grad d: Right . professor b: So , that 's a very pretty relationship between these local vectors and the ontology . And it seems to me the obvious thing to do , unless we find a reason to do something different . professor b: Does this make sense to you ? grad d: So professor b: Bhask - ? grad d: Yeah . So , we are but we we 're not doing the ontology , so we have to get to whoever is doing the u ultimately , professor b: Indeed . So , that 's another thing we 're gonna need to do , is is , to , either grad d: we have to get them to professor b: We 're gonna need some way to either get a p tag in the ontology , or add fields , or some way to associate Or , w It may be that all we can do is , some of our own hash tables that it Th - the th you know , there 's always a way to do that . It 's a just a question of grad a: Yeah , hash on object name to , you know , the probabilities or whatever . And , so , i  grad c: But it 's ,  Well , it strikes me as a What For If we get the mechanism , that will be sort of the wonderful part . And then , how to make it work is is the second part , in the sense that  , m the guy who was doing the ontology eh , eh , s ap apologized that i it will take him another through two to three days because they 're having really trouble getting the upper level straight , and right now . The reason is , given the craw bet  , the the the projects that all carry their own taxonomy and , on all history , they 're really trying to build one top level ontology ft that covers all the EML projects , and that 's , sort of a tough cookie , a little bit tougher than they figured . But , nevertheless , it 's going to be there by n by , next Monday and I will show you what 's what some examples from that for towers , and stuff . And , what I don't think is ever going to be in the ontology , is sort of , you know , the likelihood of , eh , people entering r town halls , and looking at town halls , and approaching town halls , especially since we are b dealing with a case - based , not an instance - based ontology . So , there will be nothing on on that town hall , or on the Berkeley town hall , or on the Heidelberg town hall , it 'll just be information on town halls . professor b: Well , they they they How ar What are they gonna do with instances ? grad c: But what professor b: you y grad c: Well , that 's Hhh .  , th the first , they had to make a design question , \" do we take ontologies that have instances ? or just one that does not , that just has the types ? \" professor b: OK . grad c: And , so , since the d decision was on types , on a d simply type - based , we now have to hook it up to instances .  this is professor b: But what i What is SmartKom gonna do about that ? grad c: one professor b: Cuz , they have instances all the time . grad c: Yeah , but the ontology is really not a SmartKom thing , in in and of itself . professor b: I understand , but is anybody doing anything about it ? grad c:  professor b: OK . grad c: No , but th the r eh I th I still think that there is enough information in there . So , in a sense , \" I \" used as Institutions for some s in some sense or the other . When we see what people have done , it may turn out that the easiest thing to do is to build a a separate thing that that just pools i i Like , i i it it may be , that , the the instance w That we have to build our own instance , things , that , with their types , grad d: Yeah , it 's Right , we can just assume professor b: and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type . So we build a little data structure And so what we would do in that case , is , in our instance gadget have our E V And if we d there isn't one we 'd get the type and then have the E V As for the type . professor b: So , we 'd have our own little things so that whenever we needed one , we 'd just use the ontology to get the type , grad d:   professor b: and then would hash or whatever we do to say , \" ah ! grad d:   professor b: If it 's that type of thing , and we want its EVA vector , pppt - pppt ! it 's that . And then But , the combination functions , and whether we can put those in Java Bayes , and all that sort of stuff , is ,  is the bigger deal . grad a: We could just steal the classes in JavaBayes and then interface to them with our own code . grad d:  professor b: Well , I me ye eh , yeah , the grad d: That requires understanding the classes in JavaBayes , I guess .  , you 've been around enough to  Just ? grad a: Well , it depends on professor b: there 's this huge package which which may or may not be consistent and you know . It 's b It It 's an inter sort of a kind of a it The thing is , it 's kind of an interpreter and i i it expects its data structures to be in a given form , and if you say , \" hey , we 're gonna make a different kind of data structure to stick in there \" grad a: Well , no , but that just means there 's a protocol , right ? That you could professor b: It may or may not . That 's the question is \" to what extent does it allow us to put in these G functions ? \" And I don't know . grad a: Well , no , but  What I  the So you could have four different Bayes - nets that you 're running , and then run your own write your own function that would take the output of those four , and make your own \" G function \" , is what I was saying . professor b: Yeah , that 's fine if it 's if it comes only at the end . But suppose you want it embedded ? grad a: Well , then you 'd have to break all of your Bayes - nets into smaller Bayes - nets , with all the professor b: Oh , that Yeah , that 's a truly horrible way to do d it . But , at that point you may say , \" hey , Java Bayes isn't the only package in town . Let 's see if there 's another package that 's , eh , more civilized about this . \" grad d:  professor b: Now , Srini is worth talking to on this , grad d: Mmm . professor b: cuz he said that he actually did hack some combining functions into But he doesn't remember at least when I talked to him , he didn't remember whether it was an e an easy thing , a natural thing , or whether he had to do some violence to it to make it work . I don't see why the , combining f functions have to be directly hacked into  , they 're used to create tables so we can just make our own little functions that create tables in XML . professor b: Well , I say that 's one way to do it , is is to just convert it int into a into a C P T that you zip It 's blown up , and is a it 's ,  it 's huge , but it doesn't require any data fitting or complication . I don't think  , the fact that it blown u blows up is a huge issue in the sense that  , OK . So say it blows up , right ? So there 's , like , the you know , ten , f ten , fifteen , things . It said , \" Here 's the way you 'd take the logical f G function and turn it into a CPT . So , I will , e e before next week , @ @ p push push some more on on this stuff that Dekai Wu did , and try to understand it .  , you 'll make a couple of more copies of the Heckerman paper to give to people ? grad d: p Sure . And I I 'll I 'll think s through this , eh getting EVA vectors dynamically out of ontologies one more time because I s I I I 'm not quite sure whether we all think of the same thing or not , here . professor b: Alright , great ! And , Robert , thank you for coming in under He he 's been sick , Robert . grad a: I was thinking maybe we should just cough into the microphone and see if they can't th see if they can handle it "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on spectral subtraction and the opinions of the professor and PhD F.",
        "Summary": "The team explored different approaches for spectral subtraction, including both scaling and GGT bins. Each approach had its pros and cons. The professor suggested a simple spectral subtraction followed by a KL transformation. Additionally, he recommended using JRASTRA's technique, which involved adding noise to eliminate noise. The team also discussed VTS techniques. Initially, the professor did not see the advantage of combining the Wiener filter and the subspace, but later realized that a simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform and a Wiener filter, would suffice. The log magnitude spectral subtraction utilized twelve seconds from the past and future to calculate the mean. The use of a short window did not significantly impact the model's performance, which was desirable. The team also removed silence to enhance the model's effectiveness, drawing a parallel to caching utterances. PhD F shared that the preliminary results from spectral subtraction were unsatisfactory, but mean normalization helped reduce noise. However, mean and variance normalization only improved speech, not noise variance.",
        "Article": "professor c: And  Hans -  , Hans - Guenter will be here , I think by next next Tuesday or so . professor c: So he 's he 's going to be here for about three weeks , phd b: Oh ! That 's nice . professor c: So he 's gonna look in on everything we 're doing phd d:   grad e: Th - that 's his spectral subtraction group ? professor c: Yeah , grad e: Is that right ? professor c: yeah . He 's , very , very , easygoing , easy to talk to , and , very interested in everything . professor c: he 's he 's he 's he 's phd a: Wh - Back when I was a grad student he was here for a ,  a year or n six months .  , I went around and talked to everybody , and it seemed like they they had some new results but rather than them coming up and telling me I figured we should just wait a week and they can tell both you know , all of us . So , why don't we why don't we start with you , Dave , and then , we can go on . grad e: So , since we 're looking at putting this ,  mean log m magnitude spectral subtraction , into the SmartKom system , I I did a test seeing if , it would work using past only and plus the present to calculate the mean . So , I did a test , where I used twelve seconds from the past and the present frame to , calculate the mean . And phd a: Twelve seconds Twelve twelve seconds back from the current frame , is that what you mean ? grad e:  Twelve seconds , counting back from the end of the current frame , phd a: OK , OK . So it was , twen I think it was twenty - one frames and that worked out to about twelve seconds . grad e: And compared to , do using a twelve second centered window , I think there was a drop in performance but it was just a slight drop . grad e: Is is that right ? professor c: yeah , it was pretty it was pretty tiny . And , that that  , that 's encouraging for for the idea of using it in an interactive system like And , another issue I 'm I 'm thinking about is in the SmartKom system . So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ? And ,  So I w bef before ,  Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , here , I was curious , what if I trained the models using twelve seconds but I f I gave it a situation where the test set I was subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , I th I think it was , four se I think I think it was , something like four seconds and , six seconds , and eight seconds . And it seems like it it it hurts compared to if you actually train the models using th that same length of time but it it doesn't hurt that much .  , u usually less than point five percent , although I think I did see one where it was a point eight percent or so rise in word error rate . But this is , w where , even if I train on the , model , and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test , it the word error rate is around , ten percent or nine percent . professor c: But it but looking at it the other way , isn't it what you 're saying that it didn't help you to have the longer time for training , if you were going to have a short time for grad e: That that 's true .  , professor c: why would you do it , if you knew that you were going to have short windows in testing . grad e: Wa phd a: Yeah , it seems like for your  , in normal situations you would never get twelve seconds of speech , right ? I 'm not e u phd b: You need twelve seconds in the past to estimate , right ? Or l or you 're looking at six sec seconds in future and six in professor c: Yeah . phd a: Is this twelve seconds of  , regardless of speech or silence ? Or twelve seconds of speech ? grad e: Of of speech . professor c: The other thing , which maybe relates a little bit to something else we 've talked about in terms of windowing and so on is , that , I wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in you used two seconds , and when you were four seconds in , you used four seconds , and when you were six and you basically build up to the twelve seconds . grad e: But s so I g So I guess the que the question I was trying to get at with those experiments is , \" does it matter what models you use ? Does it matter how much time y you use to calculate the mean when you were , tra doing the training data ? \" professor c: Right . But  the other thing is that that 's  , the other way of looking at this , going back to , mean cepstral subtraction versus RASTA kind of things , is that you could look at mean cepstral subtraction , especially the way you 're doing it , as being a kind of filter . You know , basically you 're you 're you 're doing a high - pass filter or a band - pass filter of some sort and and just design a filter . And then , you know , a filter will have a certain behavior and you loo can look at the start up behavior when you start up with nothing . professor c: And and , you know , it will , if you have an IIR filter for instance , it will , not behave in the steady - state way that you would like it to behave until you get a long enough period , but , by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only a subtraction of the mean , you 're kind of , you know , tying your hands behind your back because there 's filters have all sorts of be temporal and spectral behaviors . professor c: And the only thing , you know , consistent that we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency component . phd b: But do you really want to calculate the mean ? And you neglect all the silence regions or you just use everything that 's twelve seconds , and grad e: you do you mean in my tests so far ? phd b: Ye - yeah . grad e: th  , yeah , I guess it 's something I need to play with more to decide how to set that up for the SmartKom system . Like , may maybe if I trained on six seconds it would work better when I only had two seconds or four seconds , and professor c: Yeah . professor c: Yeah , and again , if you take this filtering perspective and if you essentially have it build up over time .  , if you computed means over two and then over four , and over six , essentially what you 're getting at is a kind of , ramp up of a filter anyway . But , if you do that , then , in practice somebody using the SmartKom system , one would think if they 're using it for a while , it means that their first utterance , instead of , you know , getting , a forty percent error rate reduction , they 'll get a  , over what , you 'd get without this , policy , you get thirty percent . And then the second utterance that you give , they get the full you know , full benefit of it if it 's this ongoing thing . phd a: Oh , so you you cache the utterances ? That 's how you get your ,  professor c: Well , I 'm saying in practice , yeah , grad e: M phd a: Ah . professor c: that 's If somebody 's using a system to ask for directions or something , phd a: OK . And and to begin with if it doesn't get them quite right , ma m maybe they 'll come back and say , \" excuse me ? \" phd a:   And so , there 's a higher probability of it making an error , in the first utterance . phd a: What would be really cool is if you could have  , this probably users would never like this but if you had could have a system where , before they began to use it they had to introduce themselves , verbally . professor c: Oh , the other thing I guess which which , I don't know much about as much as I should about the rest of the system but but , couldn't you , if you if you sort of did a first pass I don't know what kind of , capability we have at the moment for for doing second passes on on , some kind of little small lattice , or a graph , or confusion network , or something . But if you did first pass with , the with either without the mean sub subtraction or with a a very short time one , and then , once you , actually had the whole utterance in , if you did , the , longer time version then , based on everything that you had , and then at that point only used it to distinguish between , you know , top N , possible utterances or something , you you might it might not take very much time .  , I know in the large vocabulary stu  , systems , people were evaluating on in the past , some people really pushed everything in to make it in one pass but other people didn't and had multiple passes . And , the argument , against multiple passes was u u has often been \" but we want to this to be r you know have a nice interactive response \" . And the counterargument to that which , say , BBN I think had , was \" yeah , but our second responses are second , passes and third passes are really , really fast \" . grad e: S so , the the idea of the second pass would be waiting till you have more recorded speech ? Or ? professor c: Yeah , so if it turned out to be a problem , that you didn't have enough speech because you need a longer longer window to do this processing , then , one tactic is you know , looking at the larger system and not just at the front - end stuff is to take in , the speech with some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism , grad e:   professor c: do the best you can , and come up with some al possible alternates of what might have been said . And , either in the form of an N - best list or in the form of a lattice , or or confusion network , or whatever . professor c: And then the decoding of that is much , much faster or can be much , much faster if it isn't a big bushy network . And you can decode that now with speech that you 've actually processed using this longer time , subtraction . professor c: So  , it 's it 's common that people do this sort of thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time , whatever , in some kind of second pass . professor c: and again , if the second pass is really , really fast  , another one I 've heard of is is in in connected digit stuff , going back and l and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be a d a digit , but , which have very low energy . professor c: So , there 's lots of things you can do in second passes , at all sorts of levels . phd a: So is that ,  that it ? grad e: I guess that 's it .  , so , the last two weeks was , like So I 've been working on that Wiener filtering . And , found that , s single like , I just do a s normal Wiener filtering , like the standard method of Wiener filtering . And that doesn't actually give me any improvement over like  , b it actually improves over the baseline but it 's not like it doesn't meet something like fifty percent or something . So , I 've been playing with the v phd a: Improves over the base line MFCC system ? Yeah . professor c: Is that using in combination with something else ? phd b: No , just just one stage Wiener filter professor c: With with a phd b: which is a standard Wiener filter . professor c: No , no , but  in combination with our on - line normalization or with the LDA ? phd b: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . phd b: So , I di i di professor c: So , does it g does that mean it gets worse ? Or ? phd b: No . Like I have an LDA f LDA plus on - line normalization , and then I plug in the Wiener filter in that , professor c: Yeah ? phd b: so it improves over not having the Wiener filter . So it improves but it it doesn't take it like be beyond like thirty percent over the baseline . So professor c: But that 's what I 'm confused about , cuz I think I thought that our system was more like forty percent without the Wiener filtering . phd a: Is this with the v new VAD ? phd b: well , these are not No , it 's the old VAD . So my baseline was , nine This is like w the baseline is ninety - five point six eight , and eighty - nine , and professor c: So  , if you can do all these in word errors it 's a lot a lot easier actually . phd b: What was that ? Sorry ? professor c: If you do all these in word error rates it 's a lot easier , right ? phd b: Oh , OK , OK , OK . phd d: The baseline is something similar to a w  , the t the the baseline that you are talking about is the MFCC baseline , right ? phd b: The t yeah , there are two baselines . So the baseline One baseline is MFCC baseline that When I said thirty percent improvement it 's like MFCC baseline . professor c: So so so what 's it start on ? The MFCC baseline is is what ? Is at what level ? phd b: It 's the it 's just the mel frequency and that 's it . professor c: No , what 's what 's the number ? phd b: so I I don't have that number here . What 's ten point seven ? phd b: It 's a medium misma OK , sorry . phd b: So professor c: OK , four point three , ten point seven , phd b: And forty forty . professor c: And what were you just describing ? phd b: Oh , the one is this one is just the baseline plus the , Wiener filter plugged into it . professor c: But where 's the , on - line normalization and so on ? phd b: Oh , OK . So , with the with the on - line normalization , the performance was , ten OK , so it 's like four point three . So the h well matched has like literally not changed by adding on - line or LDA on it . professor c: OK , and what kind of number an and what are we talking about here ? phd b: It 's the It - it 's Italian . professor c: Is this TI - digits phd b: I 'm talking about Italian , professor c: or Italian ? phd b: yeah . professor c: And what did So , what was the , corresponding number , say , for , the Alcatel system for instance ? phd b: Mmm .  professor c: Do you know ? phd d: Yeah , so it looks to be ,  phd b: You have it ? phd d: Yep , it 's three point four , eight point , seven , and , thirteen point seven . phd b: So , this is the single stage Wiener filter , with The noise estimation was based on first ten frames . phd b: Actually I started with using the VAD to estimate the noise and then I found that it works it doesn't work for Finnish and Spanish because the VAD endpoints are not good to estimate the noise because it cuts into the speech sometimes , so I end up overestimating the noise and getting a worse result . phd b: So ,  so this was ,  And so this was giving  , this this was like not improving a lot on this baseline of not having the Wiener filter on it . And , so , I ran this stuff with one more stage of Wiener filtering on it but the second time , what I did was I estimated the new Wiener filter based on the cleaned up speech , and did , smoothing in the frequency to to reduce the variance professor c:   phd b: I have I 've I 've observed there are , like , a lot of bumps in the frequency when I do this Wiener filtering which is more like a musical noise or something . And so by adding another stage of Wiener filtering , the results on the SpeechDat - Car was like ,  So , I still don't have the word error rate . And the rest is like the LDA plu and the on - line normalization all remaining the same .  , so this was , like , compared to ,  Fifty - seven is what you got by using the French Telecom system , right ? phd d: No , I don't think so . phd b: Y i phd d: Is it on Italian ? phd b: No , this is over the whole SpeechDat - Car . phd b: Yeah , so the new the new Wiener filtering schema is like some fifty - six point four six which is like one percent still less than what you got using the French Telecom system . But again , you 're you 're more or less doing what they were doing , right ? phd b: It 's it 's different in a sense like I 'm actually cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum which they 're not doing . They 're d what they 're doing is , they have two stage stages of estimating the Wiener filter , but the final filter , what they do is they they take it to their time domain by doing an inverse Fourier transform . phd b: And they filter the original signal using that fil filter , professor c:  - huh . phd b: which is like final filter is acting on the input noisy speech rather than on the cleaned up . So this is more like I 'm doing Wiener filter twice , but the only thing is that the second time I 'm actually smoothing the filter and then cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum first level . phd b: And actually I tried it on s the original clean  , the original spectrum where , like , I the second time I estimate the filter but actually clean up the noisy speech rather the c s first output of the first stage and that doesn't seems to be a giving , that much improvement . And and what I t what I tried was , by using the same thing but  , so we actually found that the VAD is very , like , crucial . phd b: by instead of using the current VAD , if you just take up the VAD output from the channel zero , when instead of using channel zero and channel one , because that was the p that was the reason why I was not getting a lot of improvement for estimating the noise . So I just used the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise so that it gives me some reliable mar markers for this noise estimation . professor c: What 's a channel zero VAD ? phd b: professor c: I 'm I 'm confused about that . phd b: so , it 's like phd d: So it 's the close - talking microphone . phd b: Yeah , the close - talking without professor c: Oh , oh , oh , oh . phd b: So because the channel zero and channel one are like the same speech , but only w  , the same endpoints . professor c:  phd b: But the only thing is that the speech is very noisy for channel one , so you can actually use the output of the channel zero for channel one for the VAD .  , so a are they going to pro What are they doing to do , do we know yet ? about as far as what they 're what the rules are going to be and what we can use ? phd d: Yeah , so actually I received a a new document , describing this . phd b: Yeah , that 's phd d: And what they did finally is to , mmm , not to align the utterances but to perform recognition , only on the close - talking microphone , phd b: Which is the channel zero . professor c: So it 's not like that 's being done in one place or one time . phd d: And professor c: That 's that 's just a rule and we 'd you you were permitted to do that . Is is that it ? phd d: I think they will send , files but we we don't Well , apparently professor c: Oh , so they will send files so everybody will have the same boundaries to work with ? phd d: Yeah . phd d: Oh , i Yeah , so what happened here is that , the overall improvement that they have with this method So Well , to be more precise , what they have is , they have these alignments and then they drop the beginning silence and and the end silence but they keep , two hundred milliseconds before speech and two hundred after speech .  , and the overall improvement over the MFCC baseline So , when they just , add this frame dropping in addition it 's r  , forty percent , right ? professor c:   phd b: Yeah , which is phd d: which is , t which is the overall improvement . phd b: It gives like negative Well , in in like some Italian and TI - digits , phd d: Yeah , some @ @ . So by using the endpointed speech , actually it 's worse than the baseline in some instances , which could be due to the word pattern . professor c: Yeah , phd d: And Yeah , the other thing also is that fourteen percent is less than what you obtain using a real VAD . phd d: So  So I think this shows that there is still work  , well , working on the VAD is still still important I think . professor c: Yeah , c phd d:  phd a: Can I ask just a a high level question ? Can you just say like one or two sentences about Wiener filtering and why why are people doing that ? phd b:  . phd a: What 's what 's the deal with that ? phd b: OK , so the Wiener filter , it 's it 's like it 's like you try to minimize  , so the basic principle of Wiener filter is like you try to minimize the , d  , difference between the noisy signal and the clean signal if you have two channels . Like let 's say you have a clean t signal and you have an additional channel where you know what is the noisy signal . And you get you can do that  , if if you have only a c noisy signal , at a level which you , you w try to estimate the noise from the w assuming that the first few frames are noise or if you have a w voice activity detector , you estimate the noise spectrum . phd b: And then you phd a: Do you assume the noise is the same ? phd b: Yeah . phd b: So but that 's not the case in , many many of our cases but it works reasonably well . And then you do this  , this is the transfer function of the Wiener filter , so \" SF \" is a clean speech spectrum , power spectrum phd a:   professor c: Right phd b: And , professor c: actually , I guess phd b: Yeah . phd b: So but the thing is that you have to estimate the SF from the noisy spectrum , what you have . So you estimate the NF from the initial noise portions and then you subtract that from the current noisy spectrum to get an estimate of the SF . phd a: So is this , basically s  , similar to just regular spectral subtraction ? phd b: It professor c: It 's all pretty related , phd b: Yeah . It 's it 's there 's a di there 's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise . phd a: Do people use the Wiener filtering in combination with the spectral subtraction typically , or is i are they sort of competing techniques ? phd b: Not seen . phd b: So it 's like I haven't seen anybody using s Wiener filter with spectral subtraction . professor c: but y but there you make different approximations , and in spectral subtraction , for instance , there 's a a an estimation factor . professor c: You sometimes will figure out what the noise is and you 'll multiply that noise spectrum times some constant and subtract that rather than and sometimes people even though this really should be in the power domain , sometimes people s work in the magnitude domain because it it it works better . phd a: So why did you choose , Wiener filtering over some other one of these other techniques ? phd b: the reason was , like , we had this choice of using spectral subtraction , Wiener filtering , and there was one more thing which I which I 'm trying , is this sub space approach . phd b: So I picked up phd a: So you 're sort of trying @ @ them all . phd b: Y Yeah , phd a: Ah , phd b: we just wanted to have a few noise production compensation techniques phd a: I see . professor c: I m  yeah , there 's Car - Carmen 's working on another , on the vector Taylor series . professor c: So they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things with this task and see , you know , what are what are the issues for each of them . phd b: So so one of one of the things that I tried , like I said , was to remove those zeros in the fri filter by doing some smoothing of the filter . phd b: Like , you estimate the edge of square and then you do a f smoothing across the frequency so that those zeros get , like , flattened out . So what I did was like I p did this and then you I plugged in the one more the same thing but with the smoothed filter the second time . phd b: So that 's where I got like fifty - six point five percent improvement on SpeechDat - Car with that . And So the other thing what I tried was I used still the ten frames of noise estimate but I used this channel zero VAD to drop the frames . And that has taken the performance to like sixty - seven percent in SpeechDat - Car , which is which which like sort of shows that by using a proper VAD you can just take it to further , better levels . phd a: So that 's sort of like , you know , best - case performance ? phd b: Yeah , so far I 've seen sixty - seven  , no , I haven't seen s like sixty - seven percent . And , using the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise also seems to be improving but I don't have the results for all the cases with that . So I used channel zero VAD to estimate noise as a lesser 2 x frame , which is like , everywhere I use the channel zero VAD . And that seems to be the best combination , rather than using a few frames to estimate and then drop a channel . phd b: so we c so  , which which means , like , by using this technique what we improve just the VAD professor c: Yes . And , w  Yeah , but this all these things , I have to still try it on the TI - digits , which is like I 'm just running . And there seems to be not improving a a lot on the TI - digits , so I 'm like investigating that , why it 's not . So ,  so the other the other thing is like I 've been I 'm doing all this stuff on the power spectrum . So Tried this stuff on the mel as well mel and the magnitude , and mel magnitude , and all those things . So , one of one of reasons I thought like doing the averaging , after the filtering using the mel filter bank , that seems to be maybe helping rather than trying it on the mel filter ba filtered outputs . phd b: Yeah , th that 's that 's the only thing that I could think of why why it 's giving improvement on the mel . professor c: how about the subspace stuff ? phd b: Subspace , I 'm I 'm like that 's still in a little bit in the back burner because I 've been p putting a lot effort on this to make it work , on tuning things and other stuff .  , So to r to remind you a little bit of of what I did before , is just to apply some spectral subtraction with an overestimation factor also to get , an estimate of the noise , spectrum , and subtract this estimation of the noise spectrum from the , signal spectrum , but subtracting more when the SNR is is , low , which is a technique that it 's often used . phd a: \" Subtracting more \" , meaning ? phd d: So you overestimate the noise spectrum . phd d: So , above twenty DB , it 's one , so you just subtract the noise . phd d: And then it 's b Generally Well , I use , actually , a linear , function of the SNR , phd a:   phd d: which is bounded to , like , two or three , when the SNR is below zero DB . phd d: doing just this , either on the FFT bins or on the mel bands , t doesn't yield any improvement professor c: Oh !  , what are you doing with negative , powers ? phd d: o Yeah . So there is also a threshold , of course , because after subtraction you can have negative energies , phd a:   phd d: and So what I I just do is to put ,  to to add to put the threshold first and then to add a small amount of noise , which right now is speech - shaped .  phd a: Speech - shaped ? phd d: Yeah , so it 's a it has the overall overall energy ,  pow it has the overall power spectrum of speech . phd a: So when y when you talk about there being something less than zero after subtracting the noise , is that at a particular frequency bin ? phd d: i  - huh . phd a: And so when you say you 're adding something that has the overall shape of speech , is that in a in a particular frequency bin ? Or you 're adding something across all the frequencies when you get these negatives ? phd d: For each frequencies I a I 'm adding some , noise , but the a the amount of the amount of noise I add is not the same for all the frequency bins . Right now I don't think if it makes sense to add something that 's speech - shaped , because then you have silence portion that have some spectra similar to the sp the overall speech spectra . So this is something I can still work on , phd a: So what does that mean ? phd d: but  . phd a: I 'm trying to understand what it means when you do the spectral subtraction and you get a negative . It means that at that particular frequency range you subtracted more energy than there was actually phd d: That means that   So so yeah , you have an an estimation of the noise spectrum , but sometimes , of course , it 's as the noise is not perfectly stationary , sometimes this estimation can be , too small , so you don't subtract enough . phd a: So in in an ideal word i world if the noise were always the same , then , when you subtracted it the worst that i you would get would be a zero .  , the lowest you would get would be a zero , cuz i if there was no other energy there you 're just subtracting exactly the noise . phd d:  -  , professor c: Yep , there 's all there 's all sorts of , deviations from the ideal here . professor c: for instance , you 're you 're talking about the signal and noise , at a particular point . And even if something is sort of stationary in ster terms of statistics , there 's no guarantee that any particular instantiation or piece of it is exactly a particular number or bounded by a particular range . professor c: So , you 're figuring out from some chunk of of of the signal what you think the noise is . professor c: and there 's absolutely no reason to think that you 'd know that it wouldn't , be negative in some places . professor c: on the other hand that just means that in some sense you 've made a mistake because you certainly have stra subtracted a bigger number than is due to the noise . professor c:  Also , we speak the whole where all this stuff comes from is from an assumption that signal and noise are uncorrelated . And that certainly makes sense in s in in a statistical interpretation , that , you know , over , all possible realizations that they 're uncorrelated phd a:   professor c: or assuming , ergodicity that i that i  , across time , it 's uncorrelated . But if you just look at a quarter second , and you cross - multiply the two things , you could very well , end up with something that sums to something that 's not zero . But if down the road you 're making use of something as if it is a power spectrum , then it can be bad to have something negative . Now , the other thing I wonder about actually is , what if you left it negative ? What happens ? phd b: Is that the log ? professor c: because  , are you taking the log before you add them up to the mel ? phd b: After that . So the thing is , I wonder how if you put your thresholds after that , I wonder how often you would end up with ,  with negative values . phd b: But you will But you end up reducing some neighboring frequency bins @ @ in the average , right ? When you add the negative to the positive value which is the true estimate . But nonetheless , you know , these are it 's another f kind of smoothing , right ? that you 're doing . So , you 've done your best shot at figuring out what the noise should be , and now i then you 've subtracted it off . And then after that , instead of instead of , leaving it as is and adding things adding up some neighbors , you artificially push it up . professor c: Which is , you know , it 's there 's no particular reason that that 's the right thing to do either , right ? phd b: Yeah , yeah . professor c: So , i in fact , what you 'd be doing is saying , \" well , we 're d we 're we 're going to definitely diminish the effect of this frequency in this little frequency bin in the in the overall mel summation \" . I d I don't know if it would be phd a: Sort of the opposite of that would be if if you find out you 're going to get a negative number , you don't do the subtraction for that bin . professor c: although phd a: That would be almost the opposite , right ? Instead of leaving it negative , you don't do it . If your if your subtraction 's going to result in a negative number , you you don't do subtraction in that . professor c: Yeah , but that means that in a situation where you thought that that the bin was almost entirely noise , you left it . phd d: And , yeah , some people also if it 's a negative value they , re - compute it using inter interpolation from the edges and bins . professor c: People can also , reflect it back up and essentially do a full wave rectification instead of a instead of half wave . Well , actually I tried , something else based on this , is to to put some smoothing , because it seems to to help or it seems to help the Wiener filtering professor c:   Actually , when you do spectral subtraction you can , find this this equivalent in the s in the spectral domain . You can  compute , y you can say that d your spectral subtraction is a filter , and the gain of this filter is the , signal energy minus what you subtract , divided by the signal energy . And this is a gain that varies over time , and , you know , of course , depending on the s on the noise spectrum and on the speech spectrum . And what happen actually is that during low SNR values , the gain is close to zero but it varies a lot . Mmm , and this this is the cause of musical noise and all these the the fact you we go below zero one frame and then you can have an energy that 's above zero . But it 's the smoothing is nonlinear in the sense that I tried to not smooth if the gain is high , because in this case we know that , the estimate of the gain is correct because we we are not close to to to zero , and to do more smoothing if the gain is low . So , well , basically that 's this idea , and it seems to give pretty good results , although I 've just just tested on Italian and Finnish . And on Italian it seems my result seems to be a little bit better than the Wiener filtering , phd b:   phd d: I don't know if you have these improvement the detailed improvements for Italian , Finnish , and Spanish there phd b: Fff . No , I don't have , for each , phd d: or you have just have your own . professor c: So these numbers he was giving before with the four point three , and the ten point one , and so forth , those were Italian , right ? phd b: Yeah , yeah , yeah . phd d:  phd b: I actually didn't give you the number which is the final one , phd d: no , we 've phd b: which is , after two stages of Wiener filtering . phd d:  professor c: But do you have numbers in terms of word error rates on on Italian ? So just so you have some sense of reference ? phd d: Yeah . professor c: And this is , spectral subtraction plus what ? phd d: Plus plus nonlinear smoothing . Well , it 's the system it 's exactly the sys the same system as Sunil tried , professor c: On - line normalization and LDA ? phd d: but professor c: Yeah . But instead of double stage Wiener filtering , it 's it 's this smoothed spectral subtraction . phd a: for Do they use spectral subtraction , or Wiener filtering , or ? phd b: They use spectral subtraction , right . phd d: It it 's Wiener filtering , phd b: Oh , it 's it 's Wiener filtering . professor c: Yeah , plus , I guess they have some sort of cepstral normalization , as well . phd b: s They have like yeah , th the just noise compensation technique is a variant of Wiener filtering , phd d:   phd d: One in the time domain and one in the frequency domain by just taking the first , coefficients of the impulse response .  , what you did , it 's similar phd b: It 's similar in the smoothing and phd d: because you have also two two kind of smoothing . phd d: One in the time domain , and one in the frequency domain , phd b: Yeah . phd a: Does the smoothing in the time domain help phd d:  phd a: Well , do you get this musical noise stuff with Wiener filtering or is that only with , spectral subtraction ? phd b: No , you get it with Wiener filtering also . phd a: Does the smoothing in the time domain help with that ? Or some other smoothing ? phd b: Oh , no , you still end up with zeros in the s spectrum . phd b: the phd d: Well , I cannot you cannot hear beca well , actually what I d did not say is that this is not in the FFT bins .  So , it could be seen as a f a a smoothing in the frequency domain because I used , in ad mel bands in addition and then the other phase of smoothing in the time domain . But , when you look at the spectrogram , if you don't have an any smoothing , you clearly see , like in silence portions , and at the beginning and end of speech , you see spots of high energy randomly distributed over the the spectrogram . phd d:  phd a: That 's the musical noise ? phd d: Which is musical noise , phd a:   phd d: yeah , if if it If you listen to it  , if you do this in the FFT bins , then you have spots of energy randomly distributing . And if you f if you re - synthesize these spot sounds as , like , sounds , phd a:   phd d:  professor c: Well , none of these systems , by the way , have  , y you both are are working with , our system that does not have the neural net , phd d: And phd b: Yep . So one would hope , presumably , that the neural net part of it would would improve things further as as they did before .  Yeah , although if if we , look at the result from the proposals , one of the reason , the n system with the neural net was , more than well , around five percent better , is that it was much better on highly mismatched condition . I 'm thinking , for instance , on the TI - digits trained on clean speech and tested on noisy speech . phd d: And if we have no , spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , i the system is  , we thought the neural neural network is much better than before , even in these cases of high mismatch . phd a: Could you train a neural net to do spectral subtraction ? professor c: Yeah , it could do a nonlinear spectral subtraction phd d:   professor c: but I don't know if it  , you have to figure out what your targets are . phd a: Yeah , I was thinking if you had a clean version of the signal and and a noisy version , and your targets were the M F -  , you know , whatever , frequency bins phd d:   professor c: Yeah , well , that 's not so much spectral subtraction then , phd d:   professor c: but but but it 's but at any rate , yeah , people ,  phd a: People do that ? professor c: y yeah , in fact , we had visitors here who did that I think when you were here ba way back when . professor c: The objection everyone always raises , which has some truth to it is that , it 's good for mapping from a particular noise to clean but then you get a different noise . professor c: And the experiments we saw that visitors did here showed that it there was at least some , gentleness to the degradation when you switched to different noises . phd a: How did it compare on  , for for good cases where it it  , stuff that it was trained on ? Did it do pretty well ? professor c: Oh , yeah , it did very well .  , we 're not doing exactly that , we 're not trying to generate good examples but by trying to do the best classifier you possibly can , for these little phonetic categories , phd a: it we 'll just have to see whether it helps more or less the same , but I would imagine it would help some . professor c: So in any event , all of this I was just confirming that all of this was with a simpler system .  , Yeah , so this is th the ,  Well , actually , this was kind of the first try with this spectral subtraction plus smoothing , professor c:   And it seems that the one that I chose for the first experiment was the optimal one , so  , professor c: It 's amazing how often that happens .  Yeah , another thing that I it 's important to mention is , that this has a this has some additional latency . Because when I do the smoothing , it 's a recursion that estimated the means , so of the g of the gain curve . So , instead o of using the current estimated mean to , subtract the current frame , it 's better to use an estimate that 's some somewhere in the future . phd b: You mean , the m the mean is computed o based on some frames in the future also ? professor c:   phd b: Or or no ? phd d: It 's the recursion , so it 's it 's the center recursion , right ? phd b:   professor c: One five ? phd d:  professor c: One five ? Five zero ? phd d: Five zero , professor c: Five zero . phd b: why why is that delay coming ? Like , you estimate the mean ? phd d: Yeah , the mean estimation has some delay , right ? phd b: Oh , yeah . phd b: It isn't OK , so it 's like it looks into the future also . professor c: What if you just look into the past ? phd d: It 's , not as good . professor c: How m by how much ? phd d: it helps a lot over the ba the baseline but , mmm professor c: By how much ? phd d: it It 's around three percent , relative . phd d: mmm So ,  professor c: It 's depending on how all this stuff comes out we may or may not be able to add any latency . Yeah , b but I don't think we have to worry too much on that right now while you kno . professor c: s Yeah , I think the only thing is that phd d: So professor c: I would worry about it a little . professor c: Because if we completely ignore latency , and then we discover that we really have to do something about it , we 're going to be find ourselves in a bind . professor c: Yeah , just , you know , just be be a little conservative phd d: Oh yes . professor c: because we may end up with this crunch where all of a sudden we have to cut the latency in half or something . So , yeah , there are other things in the , algorithm that I didn't , @ @ a lot yet , phd a: Oh ! phd d: which phd a: Sorry . If if there 's another part of the system that causes a latency of a hundred milliseconds , is this an additive thing ? Or c or is yours hidden in that ? phd d:   We can do something in parallel also , in some like some cases like , if you wanted to do voice activity detection . phd b: So you can make a decision on that voice activity detection and then you decide whether you want to filter or not . phd a: couldn't ,  I Couldn't you just also  , i if you know that the l the largest latency in the system is two hundred milliseconds , don't you couldn't you just buffer up that number of frames and then everything uses that buffer ? phd b: Yeah . phd a: And that way it 's not additive ? professor c: Well , in fact , everything is sent over in buffers cuz of isn't it the TCP buffer some ? phd b: You mean , the the data , the super frame or something ? phd d:   phd b: Yeah , but that has a variable latency because the last frame doesn't have any latency phd d:   phd b: So But the only thing is that the first frame in that twenty - four frame buffer has a twenty - four frame latency . phd b: Because it just goes as phd a: Yeah , I wasn't thinking of that one in particular phd b: Yeah . phd a: but more of , you know , if if there is some part of your system that has to buffer twenty frames , can't the other parts of the system draw out of that buffer and therefore not add to the latency ? professor c: Yeah . And and that 's sort of one of the all of that sort of stuff is things that they 're debating in their standards committee . Like , I played a little bit with this overestimation factor , but I still have to to look more at this , at the level of noise I add after .  , I know that adding noise helped , the system just using spectral subtraction without smoothing , but I don't know right now if it 's still important or not , and if the level I choose before is still the right one .  , and another thing is to Yeah , for this I just use as noise estimate the mean , spectrum of the first twenty frames of each utterance . I don't remember for this experiment what did you use for these two stage phd b: I used ten just ten frames . Yeah , because phd d: The ten frames ? phd b: the reason was like in TI - digits I don't have a lot . But , so what 's this result you told me about , the fact that if you use more than ten frames you can improve by t phd b: Well , that 's that 's using the channel zero . phd b: Which phd d: But this is ten frames plus plus phd b: Channel zero dropping . phd d: no , these results with two stage Wiener filtering is ten frames phd b: t Oh , this phd d: but possibly more . The second thing I was working on is to , try to look at noise estimation , mmm , and using some technique that doesn't need voice activity detection .  , and for this I u simply used some code that , I had from from Belgium , which is technique that , takes a bunch of frame , and for each frequency bands of this frame , takes a look at the minima of the energy . And then average these minima and take this as an an energy estimate of the noise for this particular frequency band . So , I compute an FFT based on the long , signal frame which is sixty - four millisecond phd a: So you have one minimum for each frequency ? phd d: What what I what I d  , I do actually , is to take a bunch of to take a tile on the spectrogram and this tile is five hundred milliseconds long and two hundred hertz wide . phd d: And this tile  , in this tile appears , like , the harmonics if you have a voiced sound , because it 's it 's the FTT bins . And when you take the m the minima of of these this tile , when you don't have speech , these minima will give you some noise level estimate , If you have voiced speech , these minima will still give you some noise estimate because the minima are between the harmonics . And If you have other other kind of speech sounds then it 's not the case , but if the time frame is long enough , like s five hundred milliseconds seems to be long enough , you still have portions which , are very close whi which minima are very close to the noise energy . You said five hundred milliseconds phd d: Mmm ? professor c: but you said sixty - four milliseconds . Which is which ? What ? phd d: Sixty - four milliseconds is to compute the FFT , bins . phd d: actually it 's better to use sixty - four milliseconds because , if you use thirty milliseconds , then , because of the this short windowing and at low pitch , sounds , the harmonics are not , wha  , correctly separated . phd d: So if you take these minima , it b they will overestimate the noise a lot . professor c: So you take sixty - four millisecond F F Ts and then you average them over five hundred ? Or ?  , what do you do over five hundred ? phd d: So I take to I take a bunch of these sixty - four millisecond frame to cover five hundred milliseconds , professor c: Ah . phd d: on the on on the bunch of  fifty frames , right ? professor c: I see . So the interest of this is that , as y with this technique you can estimate u some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of of signal , so if the the n the noise varies a lot , you can track better track the noise , professor c:   The only requirement is that you must have , in these five hundred milliseconds segment , you must have voiced sound at least . So what I did is just to simply replace the VAD - based , noise estimate by this estimate , first on SpeechDat - Car Well , only on SpeechDat - Car actually . And it 's , slightly worse , like one percent relative compared to the VAD - based estimates .  , I think the reason why it 's not better , is that the SpeechDat - Car noises are all stationary . So , u y y there really is no need to have something that 's adaptive professor c:   But , I expect s maybe some improvement on TI - digits because , nnn , in this case the noises are all sometimes very variable . professor c: But are you comparing with something e I 'm I 'm p s a little confused again , i it  , when you compare it with the V A D - based , phd d:   professor c: VAD - Is this is this the ? phd d: It 's It 's the France - Telecom - based spectra , s  , Wiener filtering and VAD . professor c: Oh , you 're not doing this with our system ? phd d: In i I 'm not No , no . Actually , th the best system that we still have is , our system but with their noise compensation scheme , right ? professor c: Right . But phd d: So I 'm trying to improve on this , and by by replacing their noise estimate by , something that might be better . professor c: Couldn't you try this for that ? phd d: But I di professor c: Do you think it might help ? phd d: Not yet , because I did this in parallel , professor c: I see , phd d: and I was working on one and the other . phd b: So I 'm also using that n new noise estimate technique on this Wiener filtering what I 'm trying . phd b: So I I have , like , some experiments running , I don't have the results .  , the idea is just to  , flatten the log , spectrum , and to flatten it more if the the probability of silence is higher . So in this way , you can also reduce somewhat reduce the musical noise and you reduce the variability if you have different noise shapes , because the the spectrum becomes more flat in the silence portions . With this , no improvement , but there are a lot of parameters that we can play with and ,  Actually , this this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping because , you could just put the threshold and say that \" below the threshold , I will flatten comp completely flatten the the spectrum \" . So it would be like frame dropping , because during the silence portions which are below the threshold of voice activity probability , w you would have some kind of dummy frame which is a perfectly flat spectrum . And this , whitening is something that 's more soft because , you whiten you just , have a function the whitening is a function of the speech probability , so it 's not a hard decision . phd d: so I think maybe it can be used together with frame dropping and when we are not sure about if it 's speech or silence , well , maybe it has something do with this .  , you know , in in JRASTA we were essentially adding in , white  , white noise dependent on our estimate of the noise . professor c: You could imagine one that that that made use of where where the amount that you added in was , a function of the probability of it being s speech or noise . Yeah , w Yeah , right now it 's a constant that just depending on the the noise spectrum . professor c: Cuz that that brings in sort of powers of classifiers that we don't really have in , this other estimate . professor c: What what what point does the , system stop recording ? How much phd a: It 'll keep going till I guess when they run out of disk space , professor c: It went a little long ?  , disk phd a: but I think we 're OK .  Yeah , so there are with this technique there are some I just did something exactly the same as as the Ericsson proposal but , the probability of speech is not computed the same way . And I think , i for yeah , for a lot of things , actually a g a good speech probability is important . Like for frame dropping you improve , like you can improve from ten percent as Sunil showed , if you use the channel zero speech probabilities .  , so yeah , the next thing I started to do is to , try to develop a better voice activity detector . And ,  I d  yeah , for this I think we can maybe try to train the neural network for voice activity detection on all the data that we have , including all the SpeechDat - Car data .  , and the way I mi I do that is that I just use the HTK system but I train it only on the close - talking microphone .  It seems to be ,  i Actually what I observed is that for Italian it doesn't seem Th - there seems to be a problem . Because What ? phd b: you mean their d the frame dropping , right ? Yeah , it doesn't phd d: Yeah . phd d: so  , the c the current VAD that we have was trained on , t SPINE , right ? phd b: TI - digits . And actually we observed we listened to some of the utterances and sometimes for Finnish there is music in the recordings and strange things , right ? phd b: Yeah . phd d:  Yeah , so the idea was to train all the databases and obtain an alignment to train on these databases , and , also to , try different kind of features , as input to the VAD network . And we came up with a bunch of features that we want to try like , the spectral slope , the , the degree o degree of voicing with the features that , we started to develop with Carmen , e with , the correlation between bands and different kind of features , phd b: Yeah . Well , Hans - Guenter will be here next week so I think he 'll be interested in all all of these things "

        "Query": "What were the thoughts of the Project Manager and the Industrial Designer regarding the energy source for the project, and why was the idea of using solar energy rejected?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager expressed a preference for a disposable remote control that does not have a battery compartment and relies on predetermined battery life. The idea of using permanent batteries was also proposed. On the other hand, the Industrial Designer initially suggested rechargeable energy sources and later proposed a combination of solar and conventional batteries. This would allow the remote to use light as an energy source during the day and switch to the battery at night. However, the convenience of solar energy at night and the cost implications were questioned by the Industrial Designer.",
        "Article": "I just thought marketing: What was it , problem ? user interface: it didn't work anymore . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: Welcome to the conceptual design meeting industrial designer: marketing: project manager: for Real Reaction .   , and at the end ,  I  , when I finish it off I have some  input from  a master class I  visited . project manager: industrial designer: project manager: The the the the the concepts on  we  where we  must reach a decision on .  , the first one is  really about the the the the the total package  with  Well , we have decided to do a do the  with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so  it won't be   as breakable .  how how about the energy ? Can you  can you reload it or  just have batteries which you must exchange ?  , the user interface concept . marketing: project manager: At the end ,  I will take notes  and at the end of the minutes  will  be at the shared folder . marketing: industrial designer: what I did was I reviewed previously used items  by  two two  different  age groups . And  I just  watch what the differences are and I checked  , well , what what d do we want , and how can we  d aim a at  the target group . Well  what I found was that a senior  project manager: industrial designer: senior citizens  marketing: I'm sorry . industrial designer:  They , well , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more .  ,  they they they they like luxurious  styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more  soft materials . project manager: industrial designer: soft and fluffy and colourful and marketing: industrial designer: Well  , shapes are curved and round . project manager:  a soft material for a remote control ? industrial designer: No , I'll I'll get to that . industrial designer: But  the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery  versus kinetic . I figured , well that's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . industrial designer: Well , we could also use a battery , that's a bit marketing: Yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ? project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . Or you can go for both ? user interface: Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? industrial designer: Yeah , I actually did . industrial designer: and you you could you could use normal light , but  you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . industrial designer:  for  ultimate b  n  use of  solar panels , you could actually use  you could use  solar panels , but  you ha you'd have to implement them into  the remote control , leaving you  a bit less space for the interface . industrial designer: So  so i i it it wo what's actually I I c just in f I've figured it out that well ,  seeing that you'll always be  within the l  distance of T_V_ , and the from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light . industrial designer: But , well you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't  have the full amount of power actually used . project manager: But you prefer kinetic ? industrial designer: So I I prefer kinetic because it's  well , the costs aren't that much higher , and  , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . industrial designer: if No , but  d Well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you project manager: And that's enough to to keep the energy level  industrial designer: Yeah , well  actually it is . industrial designer: And it it if it isn't , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again . industrial designer: But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . industrial designer: And so that   well , user interface: industrial designer: f furthermore , you you we  checked  the cases . You ha I you sim  you simply add a basic  standard  model  it was kind of square and  I figured that's a bit boring .  , single curve , it's just a well , you know , it's just  a nice curve . industrial designer: That gives you an whole new  effec project manager: Dynamic dynamic look ? marketing:  . industrial designer: Yeah , that gives you a younger and  more high-tech look , I f I figured . marketing: But , are you going to draw it ? industrial designer: What ? user interface: Th th yeah . industrial designer: And then  in three-D_ effect you could go user interface:  marketing:  project manager: industrial designer: So y you you just Yeah , this is a this bit  difficulty in marketing: user interface: industrial designer: I didn't take a major in art . So But but you could have   a whole new  the back back the the the depth , you could you could  just play around a bit with . industrial designer: but just a Well , furthermore ,  well ,  plastic versus rubber ? You We could choose  what  what's better , plastic  or rubber . project manager: That's the material the younger people want  , ain't it ? user interface: industrial designer: Yeah , yeah   plastic  is Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic  Your your I usually associate plastic with  something that's cheap . Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . And  chip set , well  if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go  with a simple chip set . But  if we decide to go on a n   L_C_D_ screen , we would use an  we have to use an a advanced chip set . If it isn't  manageable  budget-wise , we'd have to go over to  to sim to simple buttons . So  I bet a big company in  Korea or Taiwan , like  Samsung , can give us  a big discount on the chips , so industrial designer: user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , probably , but But  yeah , that's that's marketing: So That that shouldn't be a real issue , I think . I'll I'll I'll just add ,   I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit .  what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ? marketing: user interface: I think you should use kinetic as a back-up . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , well Fifty cent  user interface: industrial designer: why doesn't And then we have single-curved versus double-curved . industrial designer: rubber ? user interface: isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a . industrial designer: You user interface: Or do you think it industrial designer: I figured it will be m rather than hard user interface: Rubber casing , yeah . industrial designer: because well if you use an  d a touch-screen ,  it's just a casing  around it . user interface: is it possible  of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? It isn't , I think , yeah ? industrial designer: Well , m I don't know . user interface: We're We put fashion in electronics , industrial designer: That isn't user interface: so maybe we can  marketing:  ? Yeah okay , but if you have a square  L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has  like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: So    so  so what are the opinions ?  rubber or plastic ? I I I prefer rubber . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: Yeah , you too ? user interface: That's good . user interface: Well , as long a as long as it's it's  it's firm , and you don't  it's not bendable or something , project manager: marketing:  yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand  project manager: Okay . industrial designer: No , that that that that's gonna The the chip set will hold it firm in place , marketing: user interface: Okay . industrial designer: and  and and  and a L_C_D_ screen also user interface: It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . marketing: industrial designer: tra  traditional versus L_C_D_ , well I figured we we all set on that . Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ , we we should have the advanced . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Okay  Last week project manager: marketing: I went to  Paris and Milan for some trend-watching . In Paris and Milan , we  asked different people ,  differing in age and in income ,  the amount of money to spend ,  what they like in design  and material nowadays . industrial designer: Well , the Teletubbies sh project manager: marketing: You wer you weren't in Paris ? Okay . Okay , our secondary audience ,  people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours .  Yeah ,  materials like wood that project manager: Yeah , but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of . industrial designer: marketing: The that isn't wood anyway , but Okay ? But , that's our secondary audience . project manager: Would you prefer   that you can choose the colour of your  remote control or marketing: I'll I'll come to that in a second point . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . industrial designer: marketing: Like the Nokia  the removable covers ,  just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . So  to come back to your question , I think  and the people in Milan and Paris also think that  the rubber should be pretty hard . The phones and the project manager: industrial designer: Well , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so Yeah . project manager: marketing: in my second sheet of personal preferences ,  we have to reconsider the speech function  recognition . project manager: So that you say  S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to  marketing: Yeah , like something . marketing: You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak  speech recognition and stuff . But , we have to keep the cost in  in mind , but it user interface: Twelve fifty  marketing: Yeah , it it can be  very expensive .  project manager: Yeah , but you don't use that th games when you watching television , I think . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . user interface: When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . Well , I do that , but Okay , and  project manager: industrial designer: marketing: And third , I stick with it , the log-in functionality  with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . So if you press  system , that's marketing: user interface: Yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . Or maybe even a step further when you want to  t  have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . And  well , how do  do we want to look at   f  Yeah Does a remote look Well , it's you've gotta hold it in one hand . So  the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands .  One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . project manager: user interface: know that if you are changing the menu structure here ,  And well , I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and  push plus twenty times . And when you get to n to  to ten , ye and want to go back ,  well you have a problem . Just m most most modern T_V_s , you you press one zero , and it goes to ten .  , what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up  button ? project manager: user interface: Yeah , yeah w Yeah , I I find I must trying to  tell it . marketing: But if you go from two to eight , and you want user interface: Or if you're watching Studio Sports on  on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two marketing: Yeah , and on two . user interface: And if you're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . But if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time  to d use the other options . project manager:  I think we can discuss a little about the the three  kind of revolutionary things  Tim  came with . marketing: industrial designer: project manager:  industrial designer: project manager: There's n not  too much decision on  that one so  I think that parental control is a good function to  to put in the remote . marketing: Yeah but What I see  How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children . marketing: And w when you want to use the parents  option , you have to user interface: It it has to be fast . You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for  the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . marketing: Yeah , ok project manager: No but I think most people  find it  much more important that their children don't watch  sex or violence  on the television , and  wait  ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can  finally watch it  because of that . You c may use like when there's  X_P_ ,  a simple log-on , d you just push  one or two or three . user interface: And if you push parents , then marketing: That then then then you have to  go to three-digit  log-in . user interface: And if you w you push p children ,  you don't have to  log in , but you can only watch  children's channels or  marketing: It automatically goes Yeah . Well industrial designer: I don't know if it's worth  the time and effort we are going to spend on it . Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time  to programming it . And I'm not sure if it's actually worth  investing that much time and effort into it . project manager: Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , industrial designer: I don't know what project manager: because  you Yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that  that he Yeah , they believe that children  are influenced by the television , industrial designer: marketing:  yeah . But there are a lot of  people will below forty who have  children in young age  who who want  to  not watch  violent or  user interface: Yeah . user interface: Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , project manager: Yeah . user interface: 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the  things to do . project manager: That's a that's a better idea ? marketing: Yeah , w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . marketing: But if you want to install it personally  If I got kids , and I could choose between  two remote controls . user interface: You're thinking about some channels they  cannot see , but well , I I when I think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock  in the evening violent films and movies  will come industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and  maybe maybe some some timing  will be  needed instead of  of channels , marketing: Yeah . user interface: because if you're watching  , I don't know , you're in the at day  , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night . But maybe there's some option that  that t  the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . user interface: Yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But , well , if you want to I i i if we in incorporate  the parental control ,  let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho  child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance . user interface: Well , yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but industrial designer: But that Well , I'm not sure because  for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the  remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant  constant signalling . industrial designer: What m what may be better is to incorporate an  a separate device that  that you can program with the remote control . So there's n that's there's  besides  the remote control , you'll have a separate  project manager: I wouldn't put it in an optional device . industrial designer: Yeah ? project manager: If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise . marketing: And and you know w  when you install another device ,  children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open  the thing and and and g project manager: Yeah . But industrial designer: But , only difference is  the  the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , project manager: industrial designer: and those people wouldn't  necessary want it . And what do you  guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? I personally think that that becomes too much . user interface: Yeah , well yeah , I project manager: It's more like it gets you to the functionality , but user interface: A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . user interface: But I don't think when you're watching T_V_  , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches ,  Yeah . project manager: That would user interface: As long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote , marketing: That that doesn't c that doesn't co user interface: but  marketing: Yeah , that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources , I think . So that will  that that that must be in it , you think ? industrial designer: Yeah , that will be nice . And the parental control are user interface: Optional in project manager: optional ? marketing: Yeah , it's it's in it . But too ma I I think so , but user interface: But how we do it ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . user interface: Is t some menu  function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on .  , but  will there   Like the first idea  from  You can buy it without and  with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and  just  user interface: marketing: To put user interface: You can put on marketing: Yeah , to put it in always . And you can just  s when you buy it , you can select  personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something . I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with  well   a receiver in it . marketing: Yeah ? I thought they were just project manager: Yeah , you yo industrial designer: Yeah , you you have some T_V_s any marketing: a able to receive . user interface: Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . industrial designer: Well yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control . But , on the T_V_ user interface: Yeah ? marketing: at least my T_V_ , is a is a compartment which you can press . marketing: And there are buttons  behind it which you can use , if you d if you don't if you don't have a industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , you could you could you could go like user interface: or make it ourselves very diffic industrial designer:  that that would actually make  things a lot more easy . industrial designer: I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but marketing: Or j Yeah . user interface: marketing: Ah project manager: marketing: I have to  consult my legal advisor about it . So  I think we have decided on the things that  from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: The case will be double-curved and  rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour  that with cover is removable . project manager: Yeah , but you have that in the user interface: What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . You use the user interface: And when you push  system properties ,  entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program . industrial designer: Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and  some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . project manager: We take it to the other meeting , okay ? I have a little w  little chat to do marketing: Okay . project manager: I went to  a master class and   two things  are  are  can come in handy  for us . Knowledge engineering and   the fact that  that  that the idea of knowledge ,  sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is  like that . marketing: project manager: It's it's  very hot at the moment , marketing: project manager: so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other  marketing: Marketing . marketing: Yeah , that's my function , to industrial designer: project manager:  W user interface: marketing: Okay . project manager: What other companies  had to  also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some  Yeah . project manager: they're a ha they're at Yeah , benchmarking , that's the word I saw . marketing: project manager: I  couldn't  Okay ,  another  thing is  there were there there was a survey , and   it came out that  people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who  are partnering  with us . So , we must  we must bring it as if  Real Reaction is  is big company ,  a trustful company , and  it has m marketing: How I know a marketing name for our product . project manager: I had a I had another idea to put   the whole the whole idea of  Real Reaction and    a single brand and   that kind of thing . marketing: - ? project manager: When you  put on remote , you see a kind of a just like when you telephone , you see a little  animation . user interface: marketing: Yeah , okay , but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and project manager: The user interface: Yeah . But w th the idea from this  thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own . industrial designer: Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can you can  have a small logo i  at the bottom . user interface: Yeah , I It's ok For f project manager: That's what they said in the master class . user interface: Oh , for the next meeting , right ? industrial designer: marketing: project manager: N  , next meeting starts in thirty minutes . marketing: Who who gave you the master class ? project manager: The master class ? marketing: Ronald Betenberg ? project manager: Franz Mehler's . industrial designer: project manager:  idea that you  the the industrial  development  centre and  user interface  will work together on a prototype . user interface:  industrial designer: So we're going to work together right now ? user interface: Stay here and project manager: Yeah , the well ,  dids this what I  what I heard . project manager: But keep an eye on your  laptops for a real  industrial designer: Yeah ,  I'm not sure if we  we Because I saw something about individual actions . project manager: Yeah , but th there's there's still the my  instructions that you will work together "

        "Summary": "The group aims to have the question answering mock-up and transcriber interface ready for the DARPA meeting in July, along with available data. Speaker fe008 is currently working on ensuring clean and properly coded transcripts, while speaker mn014's multi-channel speech/non-speech segmenter is being utilized. To save time, speaker mn005 will only mark regions of overlapping speech in the transcribed data. The task of extracting digits will be assigned to the person working on acoustics for the Meeting Recorder project.",
        "Article": "And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to \" Session \" , and write MR eleven . grad c: And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's gets marked as unread , unused . grad c: There 's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work correctly . Any agenda items today ? grad c: I wanna talk a little bit about getting how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to how to finish it up . postdoc f: I wanna ask about  , some aud audio monitoring on some of the  well some of the equipment . postdoc f: Ba - based on some of the tran  i In listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , grad c: Oh really . postdoc f: so I phd b: \" Spikes \" , you mean like  , instantaneous click type spikes , or ? postdoc f:   grad c: It could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . Well maybe Then we don't really have to talk about that as an phd b: You could try an experiment and say \" OK , I 'm about to test for spikes \" , postdoc f: I I take that off the agenda . phd b: and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . phd b: \" Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . phd b: No I 'm just  professor e: were this a professional audio recording , what we would do what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance . I guess I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on  , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . professor e: And then  , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , agendas . Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about discussion about something that he  strongly cares about then he would come and And I think part of part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the because of  the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing grad c: Mmm . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's he 's So ,  in order I 'd I think that this is a wish on his part . It 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times  things come up that are unanticipated and and grad c: Right . professor e: But  , we could try anyway , do another try at coming up with the agenda  , at some point before the meeting , say the day before . grad c: Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . phd b: That 'll be I think that 'll help grad c: I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done . professor e: Yeah , I have to tell you for the  for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that  every time before an admin meeting . phd b: I would I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . grad c: Yeah , actually I I was going to say we need to talk about that too . First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in , phd a:  grad c: and get people 's opinions on on what they think of them . professor e: So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? grad c: well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . grad c: And So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . professor e: So let 's see we grad c: Right ? So we could have up to nine . grad c: And it 's  , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel . So yeah so the only Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and and then just go ahead and order them . grad c: No , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working , phd b: OK . grad c: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . phd b: Three wireds work , professor e: Basically we found phd b: right ? grad c: I I guess three wireds work , yeah . professor e: And so  , we we seem to have  , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . grad c: Everyone 's battery OK ? phd b: I checked them this morning , they should be . But the quality seems really good and  I heard from UW that they 're they 're  very close to getting their ,  setup purchased . They 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c: Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that . grad c: They got sa apparent Well , Maybe this needs to be bleeped out ? I have no clue . But anyway there 's there 's there 's  ,  other activities that are going on there and and  and NIST and UW . But but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the Sony , grad c: Right . Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ? grad c: no , we 're having the them do it . professor e: No ? grad c: So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it . professor e: OK , so that 's being done professionally and grad c: I  professor e: Yeah . professor e: Well , it could if they do a lot of it , it 's grad c:  i it 's just their repair shop . grad c: And ,  we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . So , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . I guess Was the decision last time was that the the  transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? Has that started , or is that ? postdoc f:   grad c: Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . And  , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the  transcribers use different tools . So he has a nice set up that they it w it will be efficient for them to do that . professor e: So anyway grad c: So , you know , just  , a matter of a few days I suspect . professor e: So anyway I think we we have at least one  , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave . grad c: So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also .  , is Dave I don't know if Dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings ,  if he knows . grad c: we don't have a active one but I 'll make sure he 's on the list . Should we call him ?  is he d is he definitely not available today ? professor e: I don't know . phd a: Yeah , he was in s postdoc f: He wasn't there at cof professor e: Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him . grad c: Yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like Tuesdays and Thursdays ? phd a: I think he has a class . grad d: Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now . professor e: And the and the recordings also , postdoc f:  professor e: just where we are . postdoc f: Well , so  , should we we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or ? grad c: Well , we have about thirty - two hours  as of , I guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours . professor e: And and that 's that 's  How much of that is digits ? It 's  that 's including digits , grad c: That 's including digits . professor e: right ? grad c: I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits . So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of There 's got to be more than thirty hour phd a: Mmm . grad c: Of of non - digits ? professor e: i it couldn't of Of non - digits . postdoc f: OK , and the transcribers h I , don't have the exact numbers , but I think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished  , transcribing from them right now . The next step is to that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . What  by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that  , Liz requested in terms of  ,  in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . And you know , so how you could grad c: Nine two , postdoc f: e Exactly . postdoc f: So if you just say \" nine two \" , the there are many s ways that could have been expressed . An - and I just had them I  , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , a gloss th and things . phd b: one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things , if you  , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis grad c: Misspelled . postdoc f: You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . Y you mean just  on each on each line there 's a one word right ? It 's one token from the from the corpus . postdoc f: Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I I agree that 's a very good use of it . postdoc f: Well that 's that 's a way that 's You know , the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and  , postdoc f: Exactly . phd b: i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and and so it makes it easier . And that was that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . I didn't get to that point but So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then  , there 's a he she wants the  , actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either \" VOC \" for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , \" NONVOC \" for door - slam , and \" GLOSS \" for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error . postdoc f: but I I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most ha most efficiently handled by  by a a filter . So that , you know you get a whole long list exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say \" curly bracket laugh curly bracket \" , phd b:   postdoc f: then y you know it 's it 's You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space , phd b: Yeah . postdoc f: So ,  I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged  , subcategorized comments , and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying , phd b:   postdoc f: you end up with a s with  , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens phd b:   But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know  , jus grad c: You don't know what they could be . postdoc f: Yeah now TIMIT 's clear  and PLP is clear but  there are things that are not so well known , in or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say \" nine two \" or you can say \" ninety - two \" , grad c: So how are you doing the postdoc f: and  I 'd handle the numbers individually . grad c: How are you doing the  , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ? postdoc f: It would be separate The letters would be separated in space grad c: OK . postdoc f: and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is , grad c:   Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is  , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's  the you know ,  enumerated , or i grad c:   postdoc f: it 's not a good way of saying but it 's it 's the specific  way of stating these these letters . postdoc f: And so anyway , the clean those are those things and then channelized is to then  , get it into this multichannel format . But that 's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized , the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins . postdoc f: And  , Thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based   s s speech - nonspeech segmentation  , up and running and I haven't I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized . phd a: I actually gave grad c: Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ? postdoc f: Oh yes . I spent  actually  I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers , grad c: Oh good . postdoc f: and I went through it last night , it 's it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I I left them discretion at commas . postdoc f:  and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions . postdoc f: And  , and so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in in huge patches of the data . And and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . So  , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up \" gobbledy - gook \" . And on this side , this one 's picking up things like \" neural nets \" and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the  colloquial didn't . phd b: When for the person who missed \" gobbledy - gook \" what did they put ? postdoc f: It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . postdoc f: So they tried to approximate it , but it was phd b: Oh good . More of an attempt to  apparently it was very clear to her that these the a this this was a sound these are the sounds , grad c: It was a technical term that she didn't recognize , phd b: Yeah . But she even though her technical perception is just really  you know I 've I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses grad c: Right . postdoc f: then cuz \" neural nets \" and oh she has some things that are oh \" downsampled \" , she got that right . postdoc f: But ch ten solid  m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data . professor e: And and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ? postdoc f: And  professor e: Is that right ? postdoc f: Yes exactly . professor e: So let 's say roughly ten hours or so of postdoc f:   postdoc f: It 'd be more than that because I my recollection is the minutes that da digits don't take more than half a minute . postdoc f: But  the the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape , professor e: Oh , I see . postdoc f: So they 're still working some of them are Two of them are still working on completing that . professor e: So what what what 's the deal with with your phd a: The channel u thing ? professor e: Yeah . phd a: Oh , it 's just  , I ran the recognizer  , the speech - nonspeech detector on different channels and , it 's just in  in this new multi - channel format and output , and I just gave one one meeting to to Liz who wanted to to try it for for the recognizer professor e: Oh , I see . phd a: as  , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever , professor e: Right . So , I hope grad c: Is this anything different than the  system you were using before ? professor e: Yeah . phd a: There is some ,  as the energy is normalized across channels grad c: You know what  ? Across all of them . What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ? You said you 're trying some different features , or something . phd a: Oh I just  Mmm , I just use  our loudness - based things now as they before there were they were some in in the log domain and I I changed this to the to the professor e: Cu - Cube root ? phd a: Yeah . To No , I changed this to the to the to the loudness thingy with the with the grad c:  . Yeah , and I and I tried t to normalize   the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , within one channel , professor e: OK . phd a: because they 're , yeah to to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . I think the  Were were you basically done with the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this  bleep editing . So the The idea is that we need to have We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages ,  with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , professor e: Yeah . And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . professor e: I I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed .  if people have  , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . professor e: And , I   it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare . grad c: Right ,  so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for other reasons . grad c: And so that that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready ,  I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just  , tell them , \" here 's the web page \" , \" you need a password \" . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it . professor e: That 's I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say \" here is a here is \"  this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , \" here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK \" . grad c: I think that  there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . These are big , and I would much rather be ha be able to just sit and leaf through it . professor e: You find it easier to go through a large  how do you read books ? grad c: Well I certainly read books by hand . professor e: Really ?  , it grad c: Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I I 'm I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these . professor e: Going to a web site is easy , but flipping through a hundred pounds a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web . grad c: Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper . So are you thinking that  the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? Because I I do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the professor e: So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong , postdoc f: Yeah . professor e: but the way I imagined it was that  , the largest set of people is gonna go \" oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the where 's the release ? \" And then there 'll be a subset of people , right ? OK there 's  think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . professor e: OK there 'll be a subset of people , who  , will say  \" well , yeah , I really would like to see that . \" And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document ,  unless you 're searching . Searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that , phd a: Yeah .  if if  you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document ,  whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out .  , so it 's it 's  , you you 're you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where where I  , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go \"  you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , \" and then that group would need it S It seems like i if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . So that  , now we have to worry about privacy , grad c: Well , no fre for the most professor e: we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people grad c: For the most frequent case they just say \" it 's OK \" and then they 're done . postdoc f: The other thing too is it seems like professor e: yeah , that 's true . grad c: cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to . grad c: Oh that was another thing I I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it that an email approval was sufficient . phd b: Are are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ? grad c: Yes . If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I I I think they should be allowed to do that . phd b: So that means other people are editing what you say ? professor e:  I don't know about that . grad c: Well , the only other choice is that the person would say \" no , don't distribute this meeting at all \" , and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say \" don't distribute it at all \" . professor e: But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice . grad c: Well , but if if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient . grad c: If I say \" we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , \" and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side . postdoc f: The I agree that the consent forms were  , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that  , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them . postdoc f: And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that  , we wouldn't want someone to say \" oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but it was too hard to access \" . Now in terms of like editing it by hand ,  I think it 's i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited . But but it seems to me that sometimes  , you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK . professor e:   it 's also a mixture of people ,  some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . You know ? grad c: Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former . grad c: And that Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright . I I think grad c: OK , so does that mean that I can't use email ? Or what ? postdoc f: Cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking . professor e: I I th grad c: Well , I don't think I professor e: well we there was this grad c: well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues . So giving them , you think a web site to say , \" if you wanna print it out here it is \" , is not sufficient ? postdoc f: Good point . I professor e: Certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient . grad c: Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them . professor e: I 'm just wondering about postdoc f: You could mail it to them . phd a: But postdoc f: But I think it 's easier to drop in the box . phd a: Just put the button on on the web page which say \" please send me the the scripts \" . phd b: What  When you display it on the web page , what are what are you showing them ? Utterances , or ? grad c:   phd b: And so can they bleep within an utterance ? grad c: No . grad c: And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's  ,  it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level . Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand . professor e: There 's another aspect to this which maybe is part of why this is bothering me .  , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this . grad c:  that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient . You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go . Because nob you know it There was a one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , but overall people are talking about technical topics . You know , this is this we 're we 're covering We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're we 're we 're looking for the extreme case . If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache . That I think that 's I 'm sort of psyching myself out here , I I 'm trying to  grad c: I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out . professor e: but I I think that 's Well , it 's grad c: So . phd b: I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped . I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there that 's missing from the dialogue . professor e: You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , phd a: Yeah . And , you know where it 's really gonna hurt somebody , in some way the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . And and  , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , and so much fun ! that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff . professor e: and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so \" well I didn't like what he said .  , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like . No , no , I I I don't grad c: The only question is professor e: You - you 've talked me into that , but I I just think that we should make it harder to do . grad c: The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me . Whereas this web interface , I just get email , it 's all formatted , it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it . professor e: So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it . professor e: I 'm sorry so so So maybe this is a s a way out of it . professor e: You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do handle , and useful for someone else if they need it . But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that  , they get access to this if they really need it . grad c: Well phd b: So you 're saying the the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting . grad c: Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords . professor e: There 's there grad c: So , professor e: y but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying . grad c: what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure . professor e: We 're We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l  fall off a log , to do this . professor e: Right ? So th so what I would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the postdoc f: Yeah . professor e: not just for fun , OK ? but to to check this for  things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at from their memory .  and , and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that 's worded , OK ? Then , if someone  wants to review it , and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that is that we then give them a print out . And then if they say that \" I have a potential problem with these things , \" then , you you say \" OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that , \" you issue them a password , i in the grad c: But the the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me . professor e: I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble grad c: Yeah . professor e: we have grad c: So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen . postdoc f: I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing . Cuz I think if they feel that  , it 's I th I th You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , but but they might be able to argue \" oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down \" . So I 'm a little bit worried about  , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint . professor e: Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think , postdoc f: Yeah . grad c: It seems to me that sending them email , saying \" if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK , professor e: because  - huh . grad c: If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password \" , seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise . postdoc f:  we could offer that but but there 's  , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . postdoc f: I don't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage .  I I thought that you were Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it 's professor e: Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean , that having it grad c: Having it . grad c: Well the in professor e: right ? It just means they have the right to have it . grad c: the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it , postdoc f: Alright . grad c: D you want me to grab one ? postdoc f: Sh - sh well I could I 'm closer . grad c: Yeah , but you 're wired postdoc f: I could grad c: aren't you ? postdoc f: Yeah . Yeah ,  I don't wanna fool them , postdoc f: I don't know professor e: I just meant that e every ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a a bias that is presented , postdoc f: Oh yeah yeah oh I know . professor e: right ? grad c: \" If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . grad c: \" Once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r larger research community . grad c: There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . grad c: Well ,  it The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said . professor e: Yeah ,  no that it tha postdoc f: Tha - that 's true . postdoc f: And it doesn't really say we 'll send it to you , or wi it 'll be available for you on the web , or anything .  like like Morgan was saying they they grad c: They just have to make sure that it is available to them . wh  I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , it 's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . So I I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very ,  nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . professor e: That that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out , postdoc f: Good . But if you really think something is gonna And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that that is hurt by our expressing that bias . professor e: you know you might be right , it may be it was just paranoia on my part ,  but people just See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just as just because they can . grad c: It 's just a check box next to the text , it 's not any fun at all . professor e: I grad c: All no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time . professor e: Oh they won't ? grad c: It just sends me professor e: Oh good . professor e: OK , grad c: And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps .  I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data professor e: Yeah . grad c: because  , then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space . grad c: So I I wanna I just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it . Alright , so I think Yeah so if we have if i Again let 's you know , sort of circulate the the wording on each of these things and get it right , grad c: Well since you seem to feel heart  , strongest about it , would you like to do the first pass ? professor e: but but OK . Turn about is fair play , postdoc f: Al - Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that that Adam 's raised ,  about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever professor e: Sorry . i There 's something down there about \" if you agree to \" professor e: I 'm I 'm I 'm I thought I I thought about it with one of my background processes grad c: I don't think so . professor e: and I  it 's  it 's  , it 's fine to do the email . grad c: Yeah because thi th they 're signing here that they 're agreeing to the paragraph which says \" you 'll be given an opportunity . professor e: And Well and furthermore I it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that that  if it 's if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying  \" OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , \"  if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now grad c: Right . grad c: So I guess I probably should at the minimum , think about how to present it in a printed form . The problem is a lot of them are really short , postdoc f: Well grad c: and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line . postdoc f: Well I s I also have this I I think it 's nice you have it  , viewab her hearable on the on the web for those who might wonder about  , the non nonverbal side ,  I I agree that our bias should be as as expressed here , and but I I think it 's nice that a person could check . Cuz sometimes you know you the words on a on the page , come out soun sounding different in terms of the social dynamics if they hear it . postdoc f: And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people you know , shouldn't borrow trouble . What it comes down to but grad c: Yeah I think actually my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is  not good . postdoc f: Oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole  i segment a against some personal i th grad c: Right . grad c: I think Microsoft is postdoc f: Yeah exactly phd a: Oh , grad c: Sorry transcribers . postdoc f: Or or even or even there was a a line you know about how \"  - mmm - mmm Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . postdoc f: but but it was all the words were all visible , but they didn't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript .  , I I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it that nothing will slip by . professor e: But it the some something might sometime , and they  if if it 's something that they said , they might i i  , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said , postdoc f:   professor e: but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant . phd b: how do you how do you indicate sarcasm ? postdoc f: Yeah that 's right . So the so i the so we might we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was , you know , not not really what I said . grad c: So  , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it , phone and in person . postdoc f: You know I just realized something , which is of e th this question about the  the possible mismatch of  i well , and actually also the lawyer saying that  , we shouldn't really have them have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks . So it 's like i in a way it 's it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and and hear the transcript , to have that be the professor e: Well yeah , but you can't dep  , most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though . professor e: And they they have to postdoc f: So it 's not it 's not  Yeah , good . professor e: But  if you were at a meeting , and and you you don't think , at least , that you said anything funny and the meeting was about , you know , some some funny thing about semantics or something , or  grad c: You probably won't listen to it . postdoc f: It is true that tec that the content is technical , I and so i and we 're not having these discussions which professor e: Yeah . postdoc f: I  , when I listen to these things , I don't find things that are questionable , in other people 's speech or in my own . professor e:  we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have postdoc f: Yeah . Actually , I was gonna Di - Did you have anything n that 's going on , or grad d: Not really .  , my project is going along but  , I 'm really just here to  fill the project  the overall progress . grad c:   professor e: Transcribers , he was rattling the b marbles in his brain back and forth just then this this grad c: Shall we do digits ? professor e: Oh yeah . grad c: oh by the way I did find a bunch grad d: It  grad c: we should count out how many more digits to forms do we have back there ? phd b: There were quite a few . I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them , that were blanks , that no one had actually read . postdoc f: Oh , did you do that ? phd a: Burger King grad c: I 'd like a burger with that , phd b: No I never did "

        "Summary": "The remote control design should prioritize functionality, with a focus on a comfortable fit, clear and obvious functions, and legible text. The appearance of the remote should be visually appealing and eye-catching. To meet the Christmas deadline and stay ahead of competition, the remote needs to be in the market soon. The trend for that year was fruit and vegetable shapes, along with a soft and spongy feel. The star features of the remote should be narrowed down to one or two, with voice recognition as a potential option. Marketing identified three key findings: a fancy look and feel, innovative technology, and high ease of use. They aimed to combine these findings with the trendy fruit and vegetable theme and sponge material, while considering the preferences of both the elder and young markets. Specific topics discussed included color design, related symbols and pictures, and the placement of the business logo. Marketing highlighted three main inspirations: the customer's desire for fashion in electronics, the simplicity of technology, and the importance of aesthetics in the remote's shape and color. Evaluation criteria were established, focusing on a fancy look and feel, innovativeness, and ease of use. The Industrial Designer and User Interface teams scored the prototypes, with emphasis on look and feel, innovativeness, and ease of use. The decision was made to create a remote control without an LCD screen, improving the design to make it more visually appealing. All functions would be included in the same set, but some, like speech recognition, would be optional. The team would also explore different shapes and materials for the remote.",
        "Article": "marketing: What's the agenda for this meeting ? project manager: The I will  present here agenda with with with with slides to you . I've also made notes of the previous meeting and  I was about to send them you but then  I had to go to this  meeting so you will get them too  marketing: project manager: Then I hope you all have  worked out some some  some some presentations about  about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .  then I will  bring in some some some new requirements I I got  from the  account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . project manager: and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the marketing:  . industrial designer: You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? project manager: Yes  well yes w who are we going to  to well to sell this , marketing:  . So And then  we will close this meeting  user interface: project manager: and after this meeting we'll  we'll have a lunch . Maybe  why  Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? marketing: No , I don't . project manager:  you want a table to to  marketing: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . project manager: Yes yes maybe maybe you can  can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary  . Well I've just been  presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . It's probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it .  seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . project manager: Do you Do you have this  information on the web page you said ? marketing: I have an a web page yes . So basically  there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control .  , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times  and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Teletext is used  fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . marketing: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that  fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . industrial designer: marketing: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . industrial designer: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's marketing: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . industrial designer: Not enough marketing: I don't know how we'd go about combating that . What do you mean there ? marketing: For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury . project manager: But it's it's the opinion of the  of the users huh ? marketing: Yeah . marketing:  and then it's got a demographic breakdown on industrial designer: Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the marketing:  I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . user interface: You can disconnect it there project manager: You can maybe just just user interface: no ? marketing: Oh no , yeah . industrial designer: Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional  user interface: Oh yeah . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . industrial designer: Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the  both yeah user interface and functional design . marketing: One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute . industrial designer: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint  our design based on what is more important . industrial designer: Speech recognition in marketing: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . industrial designer: So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control marketing: Well potentially yeah ,  project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it would be all based on speech . project manager: Well it would it would be a solution for  when your remote control is lost , marketing: project manager:  when it has speech recognition then  i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . industrial designer: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? user interface: Oh . Well , it depends you know like there is  it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , project manager:  . project manager: Yes , user interface: It's it's going to be li project manager: that that that that's  . user interface: it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case project manager: Do you have some more important facts user interface: but it's but I don't know with twenty fi marketing:  project manager: or can we go to the next presentation ? industrial designer: Okay . So marketing: Well industrial designer: you had to to to summarise maybe the marketing: This is now talking about  who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it ,  . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five ,  twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . marketing: Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , user interface: project manager:  . industrial designer: I thi You us marketing: It'll be in a different window , yep . marketing: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .  I okay project manager: Oh , industrial designer: I stay project manager: this is user interface: Now you can move I think yeah . user interface: It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , marketing: Sorry ? Oh .  I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very  technical background  what is it because I think in the product it is important . industrial designer: So basically  the basic function of a remote control is to send  messages to another system that is fixed . industrial designer: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually  through a  infrared bit marketing: So my method for  designing the yeah the work design  yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional  capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . industrial designer: So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing  Expert  Anna marketing: industrial designer: and  w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions  for this remote control and I show you the the working design .  we want an on off button , it can be  it's simple but it's it's important , and also  the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , marketing:  . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is  will be to well my aim would be to  design the and choose the chips and the infrared  components to build the remote control marketing: This is very quick  design ,  you stop me or interrupt me if  you don't agree on it on that . industrial designer: And  so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this  schema marketing: Well . industrial designer: that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me marketing: You drew it a long time ago ? industrial designer: you know . industrial designer: And  that's it so I won't go into details about that project manager: overwhelming . So project manager: are they cheap , or are they  reliable ? What were your industrial designer: found and yeah th you have always a compromise with  reliability and  i if it's expensive , project manager:  . industrial designer: but  this one was not this one also really  reliable  so yeah that's it for the working design ,  I hope you get clearer view on  what what a remote control is  in terms of  technical components project manager: Yes . industrial designer: but maybe yeah project manager: So user interface: But is it  can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma industrial designer: No no no no we we will  This is a preference but we can always change  project manager: What I w what I was thinking about  the the the schema  about  the sender and the receiver ,  can you can you get back to it ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah  , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not  able to change it . We will use  infrared protocol  using yeah infrared and  and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists project manager: industrial designer: and but we what we can do is   adapting the the chips inside  to the best  chips and  infrared bubbles . Of course yeah user interface: But you should be careful , industrial designer: in the chip you have it yeah . user interface: people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote    which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . user interface: So maybe we should think of marketing: industrial designer: Of course yeah we should take that into account marketing: That's handy . project manager: Yeah yes marketing: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . industrial designer: in the  user interface: Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away industrial designer: user interface: You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . project manager: I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this  th these things . So  I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , marketing: user interface: so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that  basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have  keys or buttons with which people can  press and then  changing a button will basically  change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and   industrial designer: So p as  Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is  s a question which will we have to see later . user interface: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . user interface: And  so generally  I don't have some figures sorry but  so there are two kinds of  remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play ,  volume change and  keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now   even the one  on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but   . Then there is  this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing ,  which which you can vouch . And then you have  what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop  and then you play the movie or  or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those marketing: And then well personal preferences I would  basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the  the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because  some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that  we could  aim for the like in the f coming future  that type of  applications with marketing: Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , user interface: marketing: so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , user interface: Yeah . marketing: so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: or does it know which one you want to use ? user interface:  actually  you could you could think of  having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing marketing: user interface: but   yo you you you still can't  in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option marketing: user interface: and you could play it or You can also think about having like  I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate  sitting setup box marketing: user interface: and  you have   something like   you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you marketing: user interface: and  you can just you know  when you come back you could just switch on that thing and  watch a program . user interface: In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . user interface: It's the next generation thing , project manager:  yes , user interface: but it is going to come in couple of years . project manager: but I think it's i i it's already there , user interface: It's goi project manager:  the hard disk  recorders  I I've seen them in the shop . user interface: it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both   video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . That's , user interface: No no we are not making a universal remote , marketing: yeah . user interface: we are just looking at  giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box marketing:  . user interface: which is going to sit there and  it's going to do that job for me . Because y project manager: W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . project manager: Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible  future p  prospects marketing:  . So we can always discuss about it for example  the presently the video market actually  this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually industrial designer: user interface: so it i like people are providing like  things like   movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and  your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . user interface: and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . industrial designer: Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed  online  yeah . user interface: Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie marketing:  . project manager: I have  received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and  I would like to share them with you . project manager: first thing is  teletext is a well known feature of televisions marketing: Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent  prominent  place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . project manager:  as  a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . project manager: further yes we must think ,  do we stay  to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back  huh , or do we   go further as Matthew indicated by supporting   recording  devices ? user interface: marketing: So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? project manager:  indeed indeed .  , furthermore , w we need really need to interest  y younger customers and then with younger customers  people  below the age of forty , marketing: project manager: So industrial designer: So project manager: that's to that's  there's a market but  they will grow older older marketing: project manager: and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . project manager:  therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be  have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . user interface: Yeah it's  well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , marketing: user interface: but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys marketing:  . user interface: you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and  basically   so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually industrial designer: But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , user interface: Yeah so . Yes yes marketing: that's the the the  the new and the funky things , project manager: mo industrial designer: Because they are already used to that , you know , product . marketing: that's , project manager: Yes it's recognisable industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . So , for example you have  presently  keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and   four five six like that and  you can have keys like this in form like  keys like that project manager: Mael can you hand me over this  ? industrial designer: Yes . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? project manager:  well marketing: 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all project manager: I think fi five min user interface: Forty minutes ? marketing: and it's a very important issue . too sorry , so we basically don't change the  original order of them industrial designer: user interface: but then the keys are more spacious , marketing: user interface: they don't look  so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three ,  four , sorry four here  five and six , marketing:  . user interface: so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice industrial designer: user interface: but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to project manager: Okay . industrial designer: marketing: basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control user interface: Yeah . marketing: wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? user interface: project manager: Of course they have already one . marketing: 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . I well I think many people said  in your in in your research    the appearance of the  R_C_ is is important when they are buying one marketing:  . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . marketing: In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . project manager: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance marketing: Well , we can't , with the price range . project manager: What do What do you think about What componen industrial designer: Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros  per  per R_ s R_C_ marketing:  . industrial designer: and I think  with this now you know that chips are very  cheaps marketing: If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that industrial designer: that's marketing: which would drive the cost up a lot . industrial designer: Ye project manager: Is the L_C_D_ screen marketing: For universal remotes industrial designer: I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term . project manager: I think thi this could be this could be a market because  universal remote controls  tend to be  quite expensive . marketing: And quite complicated to use , project manager: S so we can try to go in between , marketing: yes . project manager: but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal   R_C_ industrial designer: Universal . project manager: marketing: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . project manager:  yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know . project manager: I think  when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . project manager: So d Do you agree ? user interface: Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is  not too expensive . industrial designer: Yeah user interface:  and it d  Our provin industrial designer: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell  four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers  the price of a chip is  price of a chip is very cheap . industrial designer: So I'm okay for designing  a ne  less yeah a a kind of universal  R_C_ yeah . And  basically you can look to the standards of other industrial designer: Yeah that's needed , yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . marketing: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . user interface: Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . project manager: So given we are going for this   universal type  m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific  user interface content industrial designer: Yes . project manager: and  maybe you can look on on what trends are in this  in this type of market . user interface: and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good marketing: project manager: W yes , user interface: for the project manager: we  we can have lunch now . project manager: So  Then th th the next meeting will  user interface: Yeah so we meet in well what are our project manager: after lunch you have  we have  thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting "

        "Query": "What were the opinions of the User Interface and Industrial designers regarding the attractiveness and appearance of the product, as well as the price and ease of use, during the evaluation of the prototype and discussion of functional requirements?",
        "Summary": "The User Interface team believed that the product incorporated fashion elements to attract buyers, as some buttons were shaped like cherries and had a spongy texture. They also mentioned a banana-shaped wireless phone that sold for over a hundred Euros, making their product's price of just 25 Euros very attractive to customers. The product would offer basic functions, with the option for users to pay more for additional features such as an LCD and speech recognition with a microphone. To make the product look fancy and meet different customers' needs, the team suggested offering it in multiple colors instead of just one standard grey. During a discussion about creating a new product that was both fashionable and easy for elderly users to use, the User Interface team emphasized the importance of ensuring better usability and making the remote control visually appealing. The Marketing team also suggested considering different colors or shapes for the remote control.",
        "Article": "project manager:  after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . user interface: The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . user interface: The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . industrial designer: On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype  they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , can't see underneath . industrial designer: So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very nice to stock you know , stick your finger in .  the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , user interface: Thumb-shaped . industrial designer: and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side . And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do . And did you determine  the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ? user interface: industrial designer: I'd say a single . marketing: Yeah , I think it's a beautiful project manager: It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed . project manager: Alright industrial designer: project manager: what's next in our agenda ?  we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with Courtney .  so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable  yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . user interface: Feel good meaning what ? marketing: Like does it feel good , like user interface: Physically , project manager: Right . industrial designer: Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . Okay so , we're using the criteria  for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ? project manager: Are we going to indi user interface: True or false , easy to use . project manager: I say we individually rate what do you say ? marketing: You guys project manager: Just orally . user interface: industrial designer: I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . project manager: Oh , and ma it's a prototype , marketing: Well , that's that's just like that's a clay , it's a prototype . user interface: But then I'm not fashionable , so marketing: Yeah , it's a two . marketing:  user interface: marketing: does it feel good ? project manager: Imagine , since we obviously don't have that . user interface: Does it feel good ? marketing: I feel like industrial designer:  the shape of it actually does  . industrial designer: marketing:  yeah ,  and it does it have voice  the phrase recognition on it ? project manager: Yes . It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , marketing: And there's no way you can represent it on here . marketing: Then yes , then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? industrial designer: It project manager: Well we don' have the you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . marketing: And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , project manager: Right . I'd go for a three or four on that one , so user interface: Yeah I go four . project manager: Alright , and the last criteria is it is it  user interface: Squishy and fruity . project manager: Well , we've covered that with the user interface: It's just trendy , basically . marketing: So  our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: and  hopefully we'll sell millions . industrial designer: How did you get that in there ? user interface: marketing: What ? industrial designer: The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit .  it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a industrial designer: Yep . project manager: But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . What do you say ? industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: marketing: Yeah , let's let's do a lithium . project manager: I think  I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically industrial designer: it's . marketing: We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced , project manager: right . We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , industrial designer: Yep . marketing: But it's Yeah , project manager: This ? marketing: but i so i industrial designer: Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . marketing: But will we w actually we'll need two , won't we ? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . user interface: Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and industrial designer: Push-button . project manager: Right I think she's industrial designer: But we just have push user interface: push-buttons . project manager: I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? marketing: Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . marketing: So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? project manager: I don't know , they might put us well , let's just . user interface: Two interfaces , is that what w should we s say ? project manager: Two or would it be three ? industrial designer: Let's call it th marketing: Or three , because of one on each side and one on top . project manager: and we're gonna user interface: project manager: button supplements the buttons are no  okay . Now we're gonna talk about the project process  and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result .  did we have a lot of room for creativity ? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership ,  teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas . Who want who would like to go first ? industrial designer: We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . project manager: And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? marketing: Oh , overall  I thought we did a good job like user interface: marketing: We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . project manager: Right , and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like marketing: And we're a fashion forward technology company . project manager:  what about  the teamwork aspect ? How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ? marketing: industrial designer: Yeah .  minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? project manager: Irritating . marketing: And the digital the digital pens user interface: Like it's information project manager: Yeah , digital pens . marketing: Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome . project manager: Right , laptops are extremely handy , industrial designer: It was wireless too , so . And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the marketing: And these things whoa . industrial designer: project manager: 'Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ? marketing:  we are really gonna sell this . project manager: For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . project manager: And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . project manager: If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think  that's not what technology . user interface: Well , that's why I don't like  Macs or Apples , just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . user interface: Exactly , so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , no , iPods They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs .  how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . user interface: But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . user interface: I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . marketing: We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf .  the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project , user interface: project manager: and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so "

        "Summary": "The team discussed the use of different frameworks for the external file representation. While the team was familiar with Perl and preferred a flat file format due to its simplicity, the idea of using ATLAS was suggested. It was proposed to initially use ATLAS and evaluate its suitability before fully adopting it. The team also considered P files, but the concern was that they could become large. One team member, C, emphasized the importance of considering the learning curve of other options and believed that a flat file format works well for everyone. C suggested that Perl could be combined with external representations of ATLAS files to create a functional system. Additionally, C mentioned that exploring alternatives to P files could be interesting, despite the potential learning curve. Another team member, F, focused on dealing with prosodic features at the level of small linguistic units. F proposed attaching these features to words or segments, with the option of extracting smaller units. This approach would allow the team to build on their existing work without starting from scratch.",
        "Article": "professor b: So what what from what grad a: Hello ? professor b: Whatever we say from now on , it can be held against us , right ? phd e: That 's right . So I I the the problem is that I actually don't know how th these held meetings are held , if they are very informal and sort of just people are say what 's going on phd e: Yeah . phd e: We just sorta go around and people say what 's going on , what 's the latest  professor b: Yeah . So I guess that what may be a reasonable is if I  first make a report on what 's happening in Aurora in general , at least what from my perspective . professor b: And and  so , I I think that Carmen and Stephane reported on  Amsterdam meeting , phd d:  o professor b: which was kind of interesting because it was for the first time we realized we are not friends really , but we are competitors . phd e: right ? that they were trying to decide ? professor b: There is a plenty of there 're plenty of issues . phd e: Like the voice activity detector , professor b: Well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals , which was French Telecom Alcatel , and us both had  voice activity detector . And I said \" well big surprise ,  we could have told you that n n n four months ago , except we didn't because nobody else was bringing it up \" . professor b: Obviously French Telecom didn't volunteer this information either , cuz we were working on mainly on voice activity detector for past  several months phd e: Right . professor b: I said \" well yeah , you are absolutely right ,  if I wish that you provided better end point at speech because  or at least that if we could modify the recognizer ,  to account for these long silences , because otherwise  that that th that wasn't a correct thing . \" And so then ev ev everybody else says \" well we should we need to do a new eval evaluation without voice activity detector , or we have to do something about it \" . Because  but in that case ,  we would like to change the  the algorithm because  if we are working on different data , we probably will use a different set of tricks . professor b: But unfortunately nobody ever officially can somehow acknowledge that this can be done , because French Telecom was saying \" no , no , no , now everybody has access to our code , so everybody is going to copy what we did . \" Yeah well our argument was everybody ha has access to our code , and everybody always had access to our code . We thought that people are honest , that if you copy something and if it is protected protected by patent then you negotiate , or something , phd e: Yeah . professor b: But And French Telecom was saying \" no , no , no , phd e:   professor b: there is a lot of little tricks which  sort of  cannot be protected and you guys will take them , \" which probably is also true .  , you know , it might be that people will take   th the algorithms apart and use the blocks from that . But I somehow think that it wouldn't be so bad , as long as people are happy abou    honest about it . professor b: And I think they have to be honest in the long run , because winning proposal again  what will be available th is will be a code . So the  the people can go to code and say \" well listen this is what you stole from me \" phd e:   The biggest problem of course is that f that Alcatel French Telecom cl claims \" well we fulfilled the conditions . \" And e and other people don't feel that , because they so they now decided that that is the whole thing will be done on well - endpointed data , essentially that somebody will endpoint the data based on clean speech , because most of this the SpeechDat - Car has the also close speaking mike and endpoints will be provided . professor b: And  we will run again still not clear if we are going to run the if we are allowed to run   new algorithms , but I assume so .  but since  u u n u at least our experience is that only endpointing a a mel cepstrum gets  gets you twenty - one percent improvement overall and twenty - seven improvement on SpeechDat - Car phd e:  . professor b: So they agreed that  there will be a twenty - five percent improvement required on on  h u m bad mis badly mismatched phd e: But wait a minute , I thought the endpointing really only helped in the noisy cases . professor b: Yeah but you have the same prob  MFCC basically has an enormous number of  insertions . professor b: And so , so now they want to say \" we we will require fifty percent improvement only for well matched condition , and only twenty - five percent for the serial cases . professor b: And  and they almost agreed on that except that it wasn't a hundred percent agreed . And so last time  during the meeting , I just  brought up the issue , I said \" well you know  quite frankly I 'm surprised how lightly you are making these decisions because this is a major decision . For two years we are fighting for fifty percent improvement and suddenly you are saying \" oh no we we will do something less \" , but maybe we should discuss that . And everybody said \" oh we discussed that and you were not a mee there \" and I said \" well a lot of other people were not there because not everybody participates at these teleconferencing c things . \" However , there is only ten or fifteen lines , so people can't even con you know participate . \" Immediately Nokia  raised the question and they said \" oh yeah we agree this is not good to to  dissolve the   the  the criterion . professor b: So now officially , Nokia is   complaining and said they they are looking for support ,  I think QualComm is  saying , too \" we shouldn't abandon the fifty percent yet . professor b: Next Wednesday we are going to have  another  teleconferencing call , so we 'll see what  where it goes . phd e: So what about the issue of  the weights on the for the different systems , the well - matched , and medium - mismatched and professor b: Yeah , that 's what that 's a g very good  point , because David says \" well you know we ca we can manipulate this number by choosing the right weights anyways . professor b:  yeah , if of course if you put a zero  weight zero on a mismatched condition , or highly mismatched then then you are done . So phd e: And they 're the staying the same ? professor b: Well , of course people will not like it . Now What is happening now is that I th I think that people try to match the criterion to solution . But it 's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could . professor b: Basically , I think that that this test was a little bit bogus because of the data and  essentially there were these arbitrary decisions made , and and everything . So what we are doing at OGI now is    working basically on our parts which we I think a little bit neglected , like noise separation .  so we are looking in ways is in  which  with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically , which would be a l  , f more robust to noise , and so far not much  success . professor b: We tried  things which  a long time ago Bill Byrne suggested , instead of using Fourier spectrum , from Fourier transform , use the spectrum from LPC model . Their argument there was the LPC model fits the peaks of the spectrum , so it may be m naturally more robust in noise . And I thought \" well , that makes sense , \" but so far we can't get much much out of it . professor b:  we may try some standard techniques like spectral subtraction and phd e: You haven't tried that yet ? professor b: not not not much . professor b: like for instance  Dennis Klatt was suggesting  the one way to  deal with noisy speech is to add noise to everything . phd e: Oh ! professor b: So that makes  th any additive noise less addi less a a effective , phd e: I see . It was kind of like one of these things , you know , but if you think about it , it 's actually pretty ingenious . So well , you know , just take a take a spectrum and and and add of the constant , C , to every every value . And if if then if this data becomes noisy , it b it becomes eff effectively becomes less noisy basically . professor b: But of course you cannot add too much noise because then you 'll s then you 're clean recognition goes down , but  it 's yet to be seen how much , it 's a very simple technique . professor b: Yes indeed it 's a very simple technique , you just take your spectrum and and use whatever is coming from FFT , add constant , phd e:  . That that Or the other thing is of course if you have a spectrum , what you can s start doing , you can leave start leaving out the p the parts which are   low in energy and then perhaps  one could try to find a a all - pole model to such a spectrum . Because a all - pole model will still try to to to put the the continuation basically of the of the model into these parts where the issue set to zero . phd e:  ! What is that ? professor b: Ah , you don't know about TRAPS ! grad a:  . phd e: The TRAPS sound familiar , I but I don't professor b: Yeah  tha This is familiar like sort of because we gave you the name , but , what it is , is that normally what you do is that you recognize  speech based on a shortened spectrum . professor b: Essentially L P - LPC , mel cepstrum , everything starts with a spectral slice .  so if you s So , given the spectrogram you essentially are sliding sliding the spectrogram along the  f frequency axis phd e:   professor b: So you can say \" well you can also take the time trajectory of the energy at a given frequency \" , and what you get is then , that you get a p vector . Namely you can say i it I will I will say that this vector will eh will will describe the phoneme which is in the center of the vector . professor b: And you so you classi so it 's a very different vector , very different properties , we don't know much about it , but the truth is phd e:  . But you have many of those vectors per phoneme , professor b: Well , so you get many decisions . professor b: Because if you run this  recognition , you get you still get about twenty percent error  twenty percent correct . professor b: on on like for the frame by frame basis , so   so it 's much better than chance . But  the latest  observation  is that you you you are you can get quite a big advantage of using two critical bands at the same time . Because there are some reasons I can I could talk about , will have to tell you about things like masking experiments which     yield critical bands , and also experiments with release of masking , which actually tell you that something is happening across critical bands , across bands . And phd e: Well how do you how do you  convert this  energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers ? professor b: It 's     time T - zero is one number , time t phd e: Yeah but what 's the number ? Is it just the professor b: It 's a spectral energy , logarithmic spectral energy , phd e: it 's just the amount of energy in that band from f in that time interval . professor b: And that 's what that 's what I 'm saying then , so this is a this is a starting vector . professor b: for instance a question is like \" how correlated are the elements of this vector ? \" Turns out they are quite correlated , because  , especially the neighboring ones , right ? They they represent the same almost the same configuration of the vocal tract . professor b: Then the question is  \" can you describe elements of this vector by Gaussian distributions \" , or to what extent ? Because  And and and so on and so on . professor b: But  is the is the critical band the right   dimension ? So we somehow made arbitrary decision , \" yes \" . Then but then now we are thinking a lot how to  how to use at least the neighboring band because that seems to be happening This I somehow start to believe that 's what 's happening in recognition . Cuz a lot of experiments point to the fact that people can split the signal into critical bands , but then oh   so you can you are quite capable of processing a signal in   independently in individual critical bands . But at the same time you most likely pay attention to at least neighboring bands when you are making any decisions , you compare what 's happening in in this band to what 's happening to the band to to to the to the neighboring bands . That 's why the articulatory events , which  F F Fletcher talks about , they are about two critical bands . professor b: You need to you need to compare it to something else , what 's happening but it 's what 's happening in the in the close neighborhood . So if you are making decision what 's happening at one kilohertz , you want to know what 's happening at nine hundred hertz and it and maybe at eleven hundred hertz , but you don't much care what 's happening at three kilohertz . phd e: So it 's really w It 's sort of like saying that what 's happening at one kilohertz depends on what 's happening around it . But it 's but for but for instance , th   what what  humans are very much capable of doing is that if th if they are exactly the same thing happening in two neighboring critical bands , recognition can discard it . grad a: Hey ! professor b: Hey ! OK , we need us another another voice here . professor b: And so so so for instance if you d if you a if you add the noise that normally masks masks the  the the signal right ? phd e:   professor b: and you can show that in that if the if you add the noise outside the critical band , that doesn't affect the the decisions you 're making about a signal within a critical band . If the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band , the amount of masking is less . professor b: So the s m masking curve , normally it looks like sort of I start from from here , so you you have  no noise then you you you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching is increasing . And when you e hit a certain point , which is a critical band , then the amount of masking is the same . professor b: But , if you if you if you modulate the noise , the masking goes up and the moment you start hitting the another critical band , the masking goes down . So essentially essentially that 's a very clear indication that that that cognition can take   into consideration what 's happening in the neighboring bands . But if you go too far in a in a if you if the noise is very broad , you are not increasing much more , so so if you if you are far away from the signal  from the signal f  the frequency at which the signal is , then the m even the when the noise is co - modulated it it 's not helping you much . So things like this we are kind of playing with with with the hope that perhaps we could eventually u use this in a in a real recognizer . phd e: But you probably won't have anything before the next time we have to evaluate , professor b: Probably not . phd e: right ? professor b: Well , maybe , most likely we will not have anything which c would comply with the rules . professor b: latency currently chops the require  significant  latency amount of processing , phd e:   professor b: because  we don't know any better , yet , than to use the neural net classifiers ,  and  and  TRAPS . professor b: Though the the work which  everybody is looking at now aims at s trying to find out what to do with these vectors , so that a g simple Gaussian classifier would be happier with it . professor b: or to what extent a Gaussian classifier should be unhappy  that , and how to Gaussian - ize the vectors , and phd e:  . Then Sunil is    asked me f for one month 's vacation and since he did not take any vacation for two years , I had no I didn't have heart to tell him no . professor b: And  phd e: Is he getting married or something ? professor b:  well , he may be looking for a girl , for for I don't I don't I don't ask . Well , I 've known other friends who they they go to Ind - they go back home to India for a month , they come back married , professor b: Yeah . professor b: and then of course then what happened with Narayanan was that he start pushing me that he needs to get a PHD because they wouldn't give him his wife . And she 's very pretty and he loves her and so so we had to really phd e: So he finally had some incentive to finish , professor b: Oh yeah . phd e: huh ? professor b: Sort of figured that That was a  that he  he told me the day when we did very well at our NIST evaluations of speaker recognition , the technology , and he was involved there . So I I said \" well , yeah , OK \" so he took another another three quarter of the year but  he was out . phd e: huh ? professor b: So I wouldn't surprise me if he has a plan like that , though though  Pratibha still needs to get out first . professor b: And S and Satya needs to get out very first because he 's he already has  four years served , though one year he was getting masters . phd e: So have the  when is the next  evaluation ? June or something ? professor b: Which ? Speaker recognition ? phd e: No , for  Aurora ? professor b:  there , we don't know about evaluation , next meeting is in June . But I  , yeah , what I think would be of course extremely useful , if we can come to our next meeting and say \" well you know we did get fifty percent improvement . If if you are interested we eventually can tell you how \" , but  we can get fifty percent improvement . Do you know what the new baseline is ? Oh , I guess if you don't have professor b: Twenty - two t twenty twenty - two percent better than the old baseline . But I assume that it will be similar , I don't I I don't see the reason why it shouldn't be . professor b: Cuz if it is worse , then we will raise the objection , phd e: Yeah . professor b: we say \" well you know how come ? \" Because eh if we just use our voice activity detector , which we don't claim even that it 's wonderful , it 's just like one of them . professor b: We get this sort of improvement , how come that we don't see it on on on on your endpointed data ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: because the voice activity detector that I choosed is something that cheating , it 's using the alignment of the speech recognition system , professor b: Yeah . C yeah  phd c: and only the alignment on the clean channel , and then mapped this alignment to the noisy channel . professor b: Well David told me David told me yesterday or Harry actually he told Harry from QualComm and Harry  brought up the suggestion we should still go for fifty percent he says are you aware that your system does only thirty percent  comparing to to endpointed baselines ? So they must have run already something . But  we think that we we didn't say the last word yet , that we have other other things which we can try . Because Nokia was objecting , with  QualComm 's we basically supported that , we said \" yes \" . \"  The Guenter Hirsch who d doesn't speak for Ericsson anymore because he is not with Ericsson and Ericsson may not may withdraw from the whole Aurora activity because they have so many troubles now . phd e: Where 's  Guenter going ? professor b: Well Guenter is already he got the job  already was working on it for past two years or three years phd e:   professor b: he got a job  at some some Fachschule , the technical college not too far from Aachen . phd e:  ! professor b: So it 's like professor u university professor phd e:   professor b: you know , not quite a university , not quite a sort of it 's not Aachen University , but it 's a good school and he he 's happy .  ! professor b: And he well , he was hoping to work  with Ericsson like on t  like consulting basis , but right now he says says it doesn't look like that anybody is even thinking about speech recognition . But this is being now discussed right now , and it 's possible that  that that it may get through , that we will still stick to fifty percent . Which event es essentially I think that we should be happy with because that that would mean that at least people may be forced to look into alternative solutions phd c:   professor b: but not phd c: Which would mean like sixty percent over the current baseline , which is professor b: Yeah . professor b: Is it like sort of is How did you come up with this number ? If you improve twenty by twenty percent the c the f the all baselines , it 's just a quick c comp co computation ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: Yeah , because it de it depends on the weightings professor b: Yeah , yeah . How 's your documentation or whatever it w what was it you guys were working on last week ? phd c: Yeah , finally we we 've not finished with this . phd d: Ma - nec to need a little more time to improve the English , and maybe s to fill in something some small detail , something like that , phd c:   Well , we have a document that explain a big part of the experiments , phd d: Necessary to to include the bi the bibliography . phd e: So have you been running some new experiments ? I I thought I saw some jobs of yours running on some of the machine phd c: Yeah . We 've fff done some strange things like removing C - zero or C - one from the the vector of parameters , and we noticed that C - one is almost not useful at all . phd e: Eh Is this in the baseline ? or in  phd c: In the No , in the proposal . professor b: So we were just discussing , since you mentioned that , in it w phd c:   professor b: driving in the car with Morgan this morning , we were discussing a good experiment for b for beginning graduate student who wants to run a lot of who wants to get a lot of numbers on something phd c:   professor b: which is , like , \" imagine that you will you will start putting every co any coefficient , which you are using in your vector , in some general power . professor b: So if you put it in a s square root , that effectively makes your model half as efficient . professor b: And and  i i i but it 's the mean is an exponent of the whatever , the the this Gaussian function . phd e: You 're compressing the range , professor b: So you 're compressing the range of this coefficient , so it 's becoming less efficient . Morgan was @ @ and he was he was saying well this might be the alternative way how to play with a with a fudge factor , you know ,  in the phd e: Oh . professor b: And I said \" well in that case why don't we just start compressing individual elements , like when when because in old days we were doing when when people still were doing template matching and Euclidean distances , we were doing this liftering of parameters , right ? phd e:  - huh . professor b: and it 's highly affected by  frequency response of the of the recording equipment and that sort of thing , phd c:   professor b:  Bell Labs had he this   r raised cosine lifter which still I think is built into H HTK for reasons n unknown to anybody , but but  we had exponential lifter , or triangle lifter , basic number of lifters . But so they may be a way to to fiddle with the f with the f phd e: Insertions . professor b: Insertions , deletions , or the the giving a relative  basically modifying relative importance of the various parameters . professor b: The only of course problem is that there 's an infinite number of combinations and if the if you s if y phd e: Oh . You need like a some kind of a professor b: Yeah , you need a lot of graduate students , and a lot of computing power . phd e: You need to have a genetic algorithm , that basically tries random permutations of these things . If you were at Bell Labs or I d d I shouldn't be saying this in on on a mike , right ? Or I  IBM , that 's what maybe that 's what somebody would be doing . professor b: Oh ,  the places which have a lot of computing power , so because it is really it 's a p it 's a it 's it will be reasonable search phd e:   professor b:  but I wonder if there isn't some way of doing this  search like when we are searching say for best discriminants . phd e: You know actually , I don't know that this wouldn't be all that bad . phd e: right ? And then these exponents are just applied to that professor b: Absolutely . Each each phd e: And is this something that you would adjust for training ? or only recognition ? professor b: For both , you would have to do . phd e: So you 'd actually professor b: Because essentially you are saying \"  this feature is not important \" . professor b: Or less important , so that 's th that 's a that 's a painful one , yeah . phd e: So for each  set of exponents that you would try , it would require a training and a recognition ? professor b: Yeah . You just may n may need to c  give  less weight to to  a mod  a component of the model which represents this particular feature . So if you Instead of altering the feature vectors themselves , you you modify the the the Gaussians in the models . You modify the Gaussian in the model , but in the in the test data you would have to put it in the power , but in a training what you c in a training  in trained model , all you would have to do is to multiply a model by appropriate constant . But why if you 're if you 're multi if you 're altering the model , why w in the test data , why would you have to muck with the  cepstral coefficients ? professor b: Because in  test in  test data you ca don't have a model . professor b: That is true , but w  , so what you want to do You want to say if  obs you if you observe something like Stephane observes , that C - one is not important , you can do two things . professor b: If you have a trained trained recognizer , in the model , you know the the the the component which I  di dimension wh phd e:   All of the all of the mean and variances that correspond to C - one , you put them to zero . But what I 'm proposing now , if it is important but not as important , you multiply it by point one in a model . professor b: But but but phd e: But what are you multiplying ? Cuz those are means , right ? grad a: You 're multiplying the standard deviation ? phd e:  you 're grad a: So it 's professor b: I think that you multiply the I would I would have to look in the in the math ,  how how does the model  phd e: I think you professor b: Yeah . phd e: Yeah , I think you 'd have to modify the standard deviation or something , so that you make it wider or narrower . professor b: Effectively you , you know y in f in front of the of the model , you put a constant . grad a: right ? professor b: And and and phd e: So by making th the standard deviation narrower ,  your scores get worse for professor b: Yeah . By making it narrower , phd e: Right ? professor b:  y your phd e:  there 's you 're you 're allowing for less variance . Because see what you are fitting is the multidimensional Gaussian , right ? phd e:   professor b: It 's a it has it has  thirty - nine dimensions , or thirteen dimensions if you g ignore deltas and double - deltas . professor b: So in order if you in order to make dimension which which Stephane sees  less important ,    not not useful , less important , what you do is that this particular component in the model you can multiply by w you can you can basically de - weight it in the model . But you can't do it in a in a test data because you don't have a model for th   when the test comes , but what you can do is that you put this particular component in and and you compress it . phd e: Couldn't you just do that to the test data and not do anything with your training data ? professor b: That would be very bad , because  your t your model was trained  expecting  , that wouldn't work . After you train the model , you sort of y you could do you could do still what I was proposing initially , that during the training you you compress C - one that becomes then it becomes less important in a training . professor b: But if you have if you want to run e ex extensive experiment without retraining the model , you don't have to retrain the model . But after , you wh when you are doing this parametric study of importance of C - one you will de - weight the C - one component in the model , and you will put in the you will compress the this component in a in the test data . phd e: Could you also if you wanted to if you wanted to try an experiment  by leaving out say , C - one , couldn't you , in your test data ,  modify the all of the C - one values to be  way outside of the normal range of the Gaussian for C - one that was trained in the model ? So that effectively , the C - one never really contributes to the score ? phd c:   professor b: No , that would be a severe mismatch , phd e: Do you know what I 'm say professor b: right ? what you are proposing ? N no you don't want that . But what if you set if to the mean of the model , then ? And it was a cons you set all C - ones coming in through your test data , you you change whatever value that was there to the mean that your model had . professor b: I see what you are sa saying , phd c: Right ? grad a: Saying .   , no , the If you set it to a mean , that would No , you can't do that . phd e: Oh , that 's true , right , yeah , because you you have phd c: Wait . Which professor b: Because that would be a really f fiddling with the data , phd e: Yeah .  professor b: But what you can do , I 'm confident you ca phd e:  professor b: well , I 'm reasonably confident and I putting it on the record , right ?  y people will listen to it for for centuries now , is what you can do , is you train the model  with the with the original data . So what you will do is that a component in the model for C - one , you will divide it by by two . Then if you think that some component is more is more important then th th th it then then   i it is , based on training , then you  multiply this particular component in the model by by by phd e: You 're talking about the standard deviation ? professor b: yeah . professor b: Yeah , multiply this component  i it by number b larger than one , phd e:   phd c: Yeah , but , at the phd e: But don't you have to do something to the mean , also ? professor b: No . phd c: But I think it 's  the The variance is on on the denominator in the in the Gaussian equation . If you want to decrease the importance of a c parameter , you have to increase it 's variance . phd e: And now you 're you 're you 're changing that by squaring it . phd e: Do you see what  ? phd c: I think What I see What could be done is you don't change your features , which are computed once for all , professor b:  - huh . phd c: And then if you want to decrease the importance of C - one you just take the variance of the C - one component in the in the model and increase it if you want to decrease the importance of C - one or decrease it phd e: Yeah . Yeah , but  , but it 's it 's i it 's do - able , phd c: Well . phd e: to get  this  this the effect I think that you 're talking about , professor b:   phd e: Yeah , because if you had a huge variance , you 're dividing by a large number , you get a very small contribution . grad a: Doesn't matter phd c: Yeah , it becomes more flat grad a: Right . grad a: Yeah , the sharper the variance , the more more important to get that one right . phd e: Yeah , you know actually , this reminds me of something that happened  when I was at BBN . phd e: And this particular pitch algorithm  when it didn't think there was any voicing , was spitting out zeros . So we were getting  when we did clustering , we were getting groups  of features professor b: p Pretty new outliers , interesting outliers , right ? phd e: yeah , with with a mean of zero and basically zero variance . phd e: So , when ener when anytime any one of those vectors came in that had a zero in it , we got a great score . phd e: So if you have very small variance you get really good scores when you get something that matches . So that 's a way , yeah , yeah That 's a way to increase the yeah , n That 's interesting . phd e: You you have a step where you you modify the models , make a d copy of your models with whatever variance modifications you make , and rerun recognition . phd e: That could be set up fairly easily I think , and you have a whole bunch of you know professor b: Chuck is getting himself in trouble . Huh ! grad a: Didn't you say you got these  HTK 's set up on the new Linux boxes ? phd e: That 's right . professor b: Hey ! phd e: In fact , and and they 're just t right now they 're installing  increasing the memory on that  the Linux box . professor b: And Chuck is sort of really fishing for how to keep his computer busy , grad a: Right . professor b: that 's yeah , that 's a good thing grad a: That 's right . professor b: because then y you just write the \" do \" - loops and then you pretend that you are working while you are sort of you c you can go fishing . Then you are sort of in this mode like all of those ARPA people are , right ? phd e: Yeah . professor b: since it is on the record , I can't say  which company it was , but it was reported to me that  somebody visited a company and during a d during a discussion , there was this guy who was always hitting the carriage returns  on a computer . professor b: So after two hours  the visitor said \" wh why are you hitting this carriage return ? \" And he said \" well you know , we are being paid by a computer ty  we are we have a government contract . \" It was in old days when there were  of PDP - eights and that sort of thing . phd e: Oh , my gosh ! So he had to make it look like professor b: Because so they had a they literally had to c monitor at the time at the time on a computer how much time is being spent I i i or on on this particular project . phd e: Have you ever seen those little  It 's it 's this thing that 's the shape of a bird and it has a red ball and its beak dips into the water ? professor b: Yeah , I know , right . professor b: It would be similar similar to I knew some people who were  that was in old Communist  Czechoslovakia , right ? so we were watching for American airplanes , coming to spy on on  on us at the time , phd e:   professor b: so there were three guys   stationed in the middle of the woods on one l lonely  watching tower , pretty much spending a year and a half there because there was this service right ? And so they very quickly they made friends with local girls and local people in the village phd e: Ugh ! professor b: and phd e: Yeah . professor b: and so but they there was one plane flying over s always   above , and so that was the only work which they had . They like four in the afternoon they had to report there was a plane from Prague to Brno Basically f flying there , phd e: Yeah . professor b: so they f very q f first thing was that they would always run back and and at four o ' clock and and quickly make a call , \" this plane is   passing \" then a second thing was that they they took the line from this u u post to   a local pub . And they but third thing which they made , and when they screwed up , they finally they had to p the the p the pub owner to make these phone calls because they didn't even bother to be there anymore . At least they were sort of smart enough that they looked if the plane is flying there , right ? And the pub owner says \" oh my four o ' clock , OK , quickly p pick up the phone , call that there 's a plane flying . professor b: There was no plane for some reason , phd e: And there wasn't ? professor b: it was downed , or and so they got in trouble . phd e: And we 'll just professor b: Well , at least go test the s test the  assumption about C - C - one  to begin with . It might be that  phd e: Yeah , so the first set of  variance weighting vectors would be just you know one modifying one and leaving the others the same . professor b: Because you see , what is happening here in a in a in a in such a model is that it 's tells you yeah what has a low variance  is  is  is more reliable , phd e: That would be one set of experiment professor b: right ? How do we phd e: Wh - yeah , when the data matches that , then you get really professor b: Yeah . professor b: How do we know , especially when it comes to noise ? phd e: But there could just naturally be low variance . professor b: Yeah ? phd e: Because I Like , I 've noticed in the higher cepstral coefficients , the numbers seem to get smaller , right ? So d phd c: They t phd e: just naturally . professor b: Yeah that 's why  people used these lifters were inverse variance weighting lifters basically that makes   Euclidean distance more like  Mahalanobis distance with a diagonal covariance when you knew what all the variances were over the old data . Turns out that  the variance decreases at least at fast , I believe , as the index of the cepstral coefficients . professor b: So typically what happens is that you you need to weight the  weight the higher coefficients more than  the lower coefficients . When we talked about Aurora still I wanted to m make a plea  encourage for  more communication between between   different  parts of the distributed   center .  even when there is absolutely nothing to to s to say but the weather is good in Ore - in in Berkeley . I 'm sure that it 's being appreciated in Oregon and maybe it will generate similar responses down here , like ,  phd c: We can set up a webcam maybe . phd e: Is the  if we mail to \" Aurora - inhouse \" , does that go up to you guys also ? professor b: I don't think so . professor b: We should definitely set up phd e: Yeah we sh Do we have a mailing list that includes  the OGI people ? professor b: Yeah . And then we also can send the the dis to the same address right , and it goes to everybody phd e:   professor b: Because what 's happening naturally in research , I know , is that people essentially start working on something and they don't want to be much bothered , right ? but what the the then the danger is in a group like this , is that two people are working on the same thing and i c of course both of them come with the s very good solution , but it could have been done somehow in half of the effort or something . reasonably  good one , because he 's doing it for Intel , but I trust that we have  rights to  use it  or distribute it and everything . phd e:  ! professor b: u s And so so  we we will make sure that at least you can see the software and if if if if it is of any use . He says \" well you know it 's very difficult to collaborate if you are working with supposedly the same thing , in quotes , except which is not s is not the same . professor b: Which which   one is using that set of hurdles , another one set is using another set of hurdles . professor b: Yeah because Intel paid us  should I say on a microphone ?  some amount of money , not much . And they wanted  to to have software so that they can also play with it , which means that it has to be in a certain environment phd e:  . professor b: they use actu actually some Intel libraries , but in the process , Lucash just rewrote the whole thing because he figured rather than trying to f make sense  of  including ICSI software  not for training on the nets phd e:  . professor b: but I think he rewrote the the the or so maybe somehow reused over the parts of the thing so that so that the whole thing , including MLP , trained MLP is one piece of  software . professor b: Yeah ? grad a: I remember when we were trying to put together all the ICSI software for the submission . He said that it was like it was like just so many libraries and nobody knew what was used when , and and so that 's where he started and that 's where he realized that it needs to be needs to be   at least cleaned up , grad a: Yeah . Well , the the only thing I would check is if he does he use Intel math libraries , professor b:  e ev phd c: because if it 's the case , it 's maybe not so easy to use it on another architecture . professor b: n not maybe Maybe not in a first maybe not in a first ap approximation because I think he started first just with a plain C C or C - plus - plus or something before phd c: Ah yeah . I never checked carefully these sorts of professor b: I know there was some issues that initially of course we d do all the development on Linux but we use we don't have we have only three     s SUNs and we have them only because they have a SPERT board in . In that way Intel succeeded with us , because they gave us too many good machines for very little money or nothing . phd e: The way that it works is each person goes around in turn , and  you say the transcript number and then you read the digits , the the strings of numbers as individual digits . phd e: So you don't say \" eight hundred and fifty \" , you say \" eight five oh \" , and so forth "

        "Query": "What is the professor's opinion on the pragmatic overview of the project and can you summarize the discussion surrounding it?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed potential improvements for their model, specifically focusing on MSG and multi-band. However, the professor acknowledged that the task was challenging and their current model was not yet suitable for a real system. Despite this, the team was enthusiastic about the Aurora data, which provided a more realistic scenario, and expressed their interest in continuing to explore the task. The professor emphasized the need for further work and encouraged the team to share any ideas they had for pursuing new directions. He suggested experimenting with MSG and multi-band himself and also recommended learning more about different acoustic environments.",
        "Article": "You know how to toggle the display width function grad a: Well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet .  , so we haven't had a meeting for a while , and and probably won't have one next week , I think a number of people are gone .  , so Robert , why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with EDU ? grad b:  in a in a smaller group we had  , talked and decided about continuation of the data collection . So Fey 's time with us is almost officially over , and she brought us some thirty subjects and , t collected the data , and ten dialogues have been transcribed and can be looked at . She 's actually suggested to look  , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements . And  , we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time , two days , for example , to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time , and , sort of package the whole thing in a in a re in a few more complicated  , structure . As for SmartKom , I 'm the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis , which as of this morning should be resolved . grad b: \" should be \" means they aren't yet , but but I think I have the info now that I need . Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow , so maybe   , when tomorrow is over , we 're done . And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again Maybe it 'll take some more time , to be realistic , but at least we 're we 're seeing the end of the tunnel there .  , the  ,  I don't think we need to discuss the formalism that 'll be done officially s once we 're done .  , something happened , in on Eva 's side with the PRM that we 're gonna look at today , and  , we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University . grad a: So when you said \" Andreas \" I thought you were talking about Stolcke . grad b: And , grad a: Now I know that we aren't , OK . grad b: Eh grad c: Cuz there is another Andreas around , grad a:  . grad b: So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University , one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied . And , the  , he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he 's actually doing , and why it is s somewhat related , and by  using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using .  , so , I 've be just been looking at , Ack ! What are you doing ? Yeah .  , so , this is , sort of like the latest thing I have on it , and I sorta constructed a couple of classes . Like , a user class , a site class , and and you know , a time , a route , and then and a query class . And I tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually  , look at it more .  , so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , and then tried to The red lines on the , graph are the  , relations between the different  , classes . Like , a user has like , a query , and then , also has , you know  , reference slots to its preferences , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest . And so this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that . And So I tried to construct the dependency models , and a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on , and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see how I can do ,  put in the computational nodes in between . And so I ended up making several classes Actually , you know , a class of with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility . And so some of these classes are s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . S like , these here , it 's only like , user , but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the  , preference of the user is versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or you know , which form of transportation the user has and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case . And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites in in mind . And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , and that makes a I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . And so , I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , cuz otherwise you would c well , it 's probably the same . But  , No , you would definitely have be able to re - use , like , all the user stuff , and not not having to recompute a lot of the stuff , because it 's all from the user side . But , you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how  , using the PRM will help .  , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes . And that would basically it 's just another class in the model , with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . And then , after you group them together this no the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this .  , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff . And one is basically how desirable a site is meaning , how good it matches the needs of a user .  , so , instead of  , doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of the user wants to visit , I 'll come well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . And for each site , you know , where h how how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it . She 's ac   Eva 's got a little write - up on it that  , probably gives the the details to anybody who needs them .  , so the You you didn't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation . So one so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is grad d:   professor f: we aren't gonna build our own interpreter , so if if we can't find one , then we  , go off and do something else and wait until s one appears .  , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down . If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually  , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it .  , I actually think it is cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , will help in the expression . I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net , without going to some incredible hacking of sort of rebuilding it on the fly .  , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net . So , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert i it looked to me like if Eva were able to come up with a you know , value for each of a number of  , sites plus its EVA thing , that a travel planner should be able to take it from there . And you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever , and then plan a route . grad b:  -  , well , first of all  , great looks , mu much cleaner , nnn , nnn , Certain certain beauty in it , so , if beauty is truth , then ,  we 're in good shape . So if you have a write - up then  , I 'd love to read it grad d:   grad b: and  because , i Can you go all the way back to the the very top ? grad d: Yeah . grad b:  these @ @ these w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ? grad d: I can't really see the whole thing . grad b: or are they have they changed , in a sense ? grad d: Well I think I basically leave them to similar things . grad d: Some of the things might that might be different , maybe like are that the hours for the site . grad d: And , eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not . grad d: And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction , and and or stuff like that . grad b: And the , other question I would have is that presumably , from the way the Stanford people talk about it , you can put the probabilities also on the relations . I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not , grad a: Mmm . grad b: It 's sort of in the definition or in the in Daphne 's definition of a PRM is that classes and relations , professor f: OK . grad b: and you 're gonna have CPT 's over the classes and their relations . grad d: I remember them learning when , you know , you don't know the structure for sure , professor f: Yeah . grad d: but I don't remember reading how you specify grad b: Yeah , that would be exactly my question . So , the the plan is is when Daphne gets back , we 'll get in touch and supposedly , we 'll actually get s deep seriously connected to to their work and grad b: Yep . professor f: somebody 'll  , you know If it 's a group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever . We get rocking and rolling on this again , once we get a package , if , when , and how , then this becomes foregrounded grad d:   grad b: And  , until then we 'll come up with a something that 's @ @ that 's way more complicated for you . grad b: Because this was laughingly easy , right ? grad d: Actually I had to take out a lot of the complicated stuff , cuz I I made it really complicated in the beginning , and Jerry was like , \" this is just too much \" . So , you could , from this , go on and say suppose there 's a group of people traveling together and you wanted to plan something that somehow , with some Pareto optimal  , thing for grad a: That 's good . professor f: or grad a: Except for humans can't really solve it either , so . Well that 's the that would that would be a  , you could sell it , as a grad a: Yeah . professor f: OK , eh you don't have to fight about this , just give your preferences to the grad a: And then you can blame the computer . But what does it  Would a pote potential result be to to split up and never talk to each other again ? You know . So there i there are some some u  , you know , elaborations of this that you could try to put in to this structure , but I don't think it 's worth it now . But  , it 's good , yeah and and there were a couple other ideas of of  , things for Eva to look at in in the interim . So , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's  that 's relevant to you  , a at the moment , the the reason is really for me  , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . And and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , and  , I just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and and so I 'll be  , happy to talk to you and and  , I 'd also like to find out some more and and maybe I 'll just walk around the office and and then and ask some some questions , in a couple days . OK , so , what I started looking at , to begin with is just  , content management systems  , i i in general . So  ,  what 's  Sort of the state of the art there is to   you have a bunch of of  documents or learning units or learning objects , and you store meta - data  , associate to them . So there 's some international standards like the I - triple - E ,  There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard , and  , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have  author information , you have  , size information , format information and so on . One is  you store keywords associated with the  with the document , and one is  , you have sort of a , well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic  , ordering of of the of the units . Now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses ,  you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit  , assumption behind that is that  , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of  , whichever taxonomy is used , and  , I think that 's a that 's a very that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and  As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , science , biology , and then But that 's really all that we have at the moment . Now , what this  a standard like this would give us is we could  , sort of  with a search engine just query  , different repositories all over the world . But we can't really  , so what I 'm what I try to do is  , to have  ,  So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . Now , what what we have at our university quite a bit is that  , students  , try to u program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same problems , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and so , what I want to build is basically a a smart F A Q system . Now , what you  need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than \" I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . I 'm I 'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , context it , and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . So , I want to be able to model information like , so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , maybe what 's the background of that student 's  , which  , which error message was encountered . Now , basically giving this   so we somehow need to have a formalized  , way of writing this down basically , and that 's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again . And , using this and some some  , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some some simple inferences . Like you know that when somebody 's working about  , working on on servlets for example , he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used are written in Java . So some some inferences like that , now , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of  off the documents you 're you 're searching against . So ,  what I wanna do is basically have some sort of  given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match , and use this as a metric in the search . Now , what I plan to do is I want to  sort of do a   try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth  ,  steepest descent approach . So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? And and having  ,  a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , and find out which  which questions are worth  , asking . And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is  , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system  quickly , that that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . And   , so Robert was mentioning  , earlier today is that  , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network , which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . And so ,  what I 'm What I try to do is basically try to model this  , in a way that you could really combine  , knowledge from very different sources , and and  , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community  , came up with . Trying to to have  , an approach how to integrate s  certain  representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , what you can do with those . What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic  , computational model . And then  ,  sort of as an add - on to this whole idea ,  that would be now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which  , which  , rules and which ontologies it it uses , or basically its view of the world ,  you can get very different results . And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach , where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , and  , if you have a question about a homework , it 's probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , rather than going to some Yahoo - like  , search engine . And I think a lot of the even though it 's a it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , issues are are fairly similar . grad a: And so some of the I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , I Are you grad c:  I know , yeah I know abou about it . It 's like , you know , the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret , grad c:   We - we 've kind of talked about that , but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse . grad b: Well , in a in one t one s mmm , small difference in a in a way , is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer , but he wants to point to the places w w grad a: Documents that have the answers . So I 'm I 'm not I 'm not building an expert grad a: you have to s still m understand what the content says about itself , and then match it to what you think the informational needs grad a:   You 're just taking the keywords as a topic text , as grad c: I I assume that that the there will be learning systems that that tag their their content . grad c: And  , m @ @ and basically what I what I envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an FAQ for example you could state sort of like a logic condition , when this document applies . So \" this document explains how to set up your  , mail account on Linux \" or something like this . So something something very specific that you can then But the I think that the key point with these  , learning systems is that  , a learning system is only as good as  the amount of content it it carries . grad c: You can have the best learning system with the best search interface , if there 's no content inside of it , it 's not very useful . So I think ultimately because  ,  developing these these rules and these inference  inferences I think is very costly , so  ,  I think you must be able to reuse some some existing  , domain domain information , or or or ontologies that that  other people wrote and then try to integrate them , and then also search the entire web basically , rather than just the small  , content management system . grad c: So I think that 's that 's crucial for for the success of or @ @ grad a: So , you 're not I guess I 'm trying to figure out how how it maps to the kinds of things that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups , grad c:   grad a: cuz some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses , and I 'm guessing that you you won't be doing that ? OK . grad a: So , you take the query , and and professor f: On the other hand , FrameNet could well be useful . professor f: Because , you know , the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames , and the frames may well give you additional keywords or  , if you know that that that a a bunch of keywords  , indicate a frame , then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame , rather th than just  , individual grad c: Mmm . There 's linguists and stuff and there 's a lot of it and they 're they 're busily working away . And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that . I 'm sure I could learn a lot about  , yeah , just how to how to come up with these structures , grad a: Mmm . grad c: cuz it 's it 's very easy to whip up something quickly , but it maybe then makes sense to to me , but not to anybody else , and and if we want to share and integrate things , they must well , they must be well designed really . grad b: And Andreas and I tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with a eh with him working on an interface for FrameNet , as it was back then , that would p do some of the work for this machine , professor f: Right . grad b: which  , never got done because Prashant found a happy occupation professor f: W yeah , I know ,  it it he w he did w what what he did was much more s sensible for him . professor f: I think  , grad b: But so I 'm just saying , the  , we had that idea professor f: you know Yeah . professor f: Yeah , actually you guys never grad b: And Srini 's doing information extraction also , right ? professor f: Right . grad c: professor f: this was supposedly an exchange program , and I we you know , it 's fine . We don't care , but it just I 'm a little surprised that  , Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send .  I had forgotten a I To be honest with you , I 'd totally forgotten we had a program . grad b:  it 's in the program ? grad c:  I I think it 's it 's really the lack of students  , at IU at the moment . I think it 's ju it 's more the lack of of students , really , and w we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams . grad c: Well  if if I were a student , I 'd love to come here , rather than work for some German company , or professor f: Yeah . professor f: Oh , right ! grad c: Well , I didn't say anybody to anything to offend well , except for the sponsors maybe , but professor f: Right . So I thi tha that 's that 's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you 're here . professor f: unfortunately , Srini , who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town . professor f: I don't know why he @ @ oh , I , who knows ? grad a: The  professor f: Anyway , s yeah , you 'll see you 'll certainly see a lot of the people there . grad a: The other person I thought of is Dan Gildea ? because he did some work on topic spotting professor f: Yeah . I don't Depending on how well you wanna integrate with that end , grad c:   grad a: you know , like , taking the data and fig you said the learning systems that figure out We There 's someone in ICSI who actually has been working on has worked on that kinda stuff , and he 's worked with frame net , so you could talk to him about , you know , both of those things at once . grad c: So , who is that again ? grad a: And , he 's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff , grad b: Who ? I can take you to his office . professor f: Alright , was there anything else for this ? One of these times soon we 're gonna hear about construal . professor f: Good thinking ! grad b:  well , maybe I can I can bribe my way out of this . professor f: Well , no , but he 's he 's he 's he 's as you said , he 's , like the state legislature , he 's trying to offer us bribes . grad b: This  Oh , they refused the budget again ? Is it so about CITRIS ? Yeah , still nothing . professor f: this this this t the s we 're , involved in a literally three hundred million dollar  , program . And , the State of California is now a month and a half behind its legis its legally required date to approve a budget . professor f: and , yesterdayday there was this   I thought that the other branch would just approve it , but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who who approved it got flak from there , eh anyway . So ,  Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , OK ? And then we 'll go . In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS , even though we don't have the money they So they 've been hiring people right and left , so , they think the money 's coming . And , is now doing all the politics for CITRIS , but also , has a  , a lot of interest in  , actually doing things for society , so digital divide and stuff like that . But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , something that is of great social value . He said , \" for example \" , this was his only example , \" if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , and as compelling as a video game , then that would have a huge social impact \" . So it was nice that  , he 's got this view , of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B , language would be a good way to do it . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing , grad a:  - huh . professor f: but , you know , a again , if if you if you grad a: Oh . So this is reading , rather than teaching Another project we started on , and and didn't get funded for was , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , for kids whose first language wasn't English . So , enormous problem in California , and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build  , programs that would be tutors for the kids . professor f: and  , I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now , but it i it 's it 's interesting and I may  , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that . So I I did manage to get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS , professor f: No , no . grad b: but , I I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n  among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings , professor f: Yeah . grad b: and also revising , thanks for all the comments , the c the original construal proposal . And , if I put one and one together , I may end up with a number that 's greater than one and that I I can potentially present once you get back . Yeah , so OK , so that 'd be great , but I 'd I think it 's it 's time again , right ? grad b: Absolutely . grad b: But  , and hopefully all sidetracking  , other things will have disappeared , soon "

        "Query": "Why did User Interface propose using more buttons in the technical function design and what were the advantages of big thick keys? Additionally, what did the User Interface discuss about the shape of the button and what recommendations did the user interface designer make regarding the problem of having fewer buttons?",
        "Summary": "The User Interface team suggested reducing the number of buttons for DVD control compared to the current design, aiming to keep the maximum number of buttons within ten. Taking inspiration from mobile phones, they proposed using big thick keys for the remote control, which are popular among younger generations and create a less cluttered and more spacious look. The team agreed on a round shape for most buttons arranged in a triangle, with a square button in the middle and four buttons for channel and volume control. The industrial designer recommended incorporating multiple functions into one button using a switch menu, categorizing functions and linking them to specific menu categories.",
        "Article": "user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And this  design , detailed design meeting  we will discuss  the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . If you hold it and you press another button ,  the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? user interface: So Yeah . marketing: when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . user interface: that's just  the normal  as th as the normal  remote controls  So  You put it  you  came in  page  one hundred . user interface: Oh yeah ? project manager: But  I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . user interface: industrial designer: I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this . industrial designer: because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ? industrial designer: Yeah , they're project manager: Just n normal plain buttons . user interface: it industrial designer: But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . project manager: If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see  something wrong . project manager: I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . project manager: Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . project manager: I think we can  discard the help and the mute button  by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . project manager: And this is marketing: d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ? project manager: No those are one , I think . Where did  marketing: Well , think actually there're two buttons , user interface: it's just one button . project manager: So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing marketing: Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . user interface: So  , project manager: Yeah w user interface: we've still got four buttons , but just  So project manager: Yeah th I think they count  the materials . user interface: You got  not not a butt button itself , but  on the  project manager: Yeah on the chip there . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . project manager: I think they  try t industrial designer: If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . project manager: That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? marketing: Only the docking station , I guess . industrial designer: Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th  these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . industrial designer: So user interface: Are we gonna buy a  a remote control  when you can  use it ? marketing:  user interface: So  Yeah . marketing: Well , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . So project manager: I think it's  difficult as well , marketing: Or b project manager: but marketing: Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . project manager: Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . marketing: But how does scroll-wheel work here ? project manager: Then you will Or maybe you can  scroll . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ? industrial designer: If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . project manager: Yeah but I think that's That is a big advantage , user interface: So Yeah project manager: if we're user interface: Yeah it's a big advantage . project manager: But user interface: But  , it's project manager: Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? user interface: yeah . project manager: If you push it three times ? marketing: Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are user interface: Yeah . marketing: right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , project manager: Yeah . user interface: But if you push the teletext button twice industrial designer: What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . marketing: I think that's the case on most user interface: It's  One m  one b  , a few buttons . project manager: Ah that's not really that marketing: Well , that could be just  like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . marketing: But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , industrial designer: No . marketing: Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . project manager: I think if you make a good advertisement  on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . industrial designer: If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . industrial designer: So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button project manager:  yeah . user interface: But  , you can make a f quite a big  remote remote control for  just the same price as a small one . It's  it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think .  , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ? marketing: Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design . Yeah I'm ag marketing: I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote . project manager: So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , user interface: Yeah . project manager: No , but I think marketing: So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . project manager: I think the most user interface: But they know the scroll-buttons from  old radios . project manager: We can let l user interface: So maybe it's  project manager: We can stick it out , a bit . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and  But we will see . marketing: Five more minutes ? project manager: No we've got fifteen minutes but marketing: Okay . What ? marketing: 'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . Innovative ? What new functions are there ?  , easy to use ?  , learnability is a very important factor here .  , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions  among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost . If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? And So we're supposed to evaluate it right now . Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . marketing: Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? project manager: I think it's fancy . Sh marketing: I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . project manager: So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ? industrial designer: user interface: marketing: Should be do-able . project manager: Is it functional ? industrial designer: marketing: Is the design functional ?  , do we have all functions that we want to include ? project manager: Yes . Oh , and do we  take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and R_S_I_ influences ? user interface:  m industrial designer: we haven't thought of that one . marketing: Are the production costs within the preset limits ? industrial designer: marketing: Well they are now . project manager: No I think with our new radio button , I think it's  I think it's better . marketing: I think project manager: I think it marketing: I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control . I was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this . marketing: Is this Like after this , are we done ? Or project manager: N We've gonna We're going to evaluate it . project manager: What is it ? marketing: Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here . industrial designer: Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance  marketing: Yeah , true . Was it clear what everybody had to do  according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you two of you with the  last phase ? user interface: So industrial designer: Yes , was okay . industrial designer: The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy . Were the means sufficient for the tasks  we had to do ? Or were they too much ? user interface:  . industrial designer: Well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but The digital the digital pen is very nice . industrial designer: A flip-over or a more precise  digit user interface: A flipper's  easier , so Yeah . user interface: But if you want to share  of  when you make  a picture like this  on the presentation , it's easier to  share it with  other people . user interface: you can sh save it  and  put it on the internet , or   in shared f  folder or  sh  shared directory . marketing: Yeah , user interface: So So marketing: I tried to open the file on my laptop , user interface: Yeah ? No ? industrial designer: No . project manager: But I think you can user interface: T can  can you export it  like a Yeah . Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? Or user interface: yeah maybe   when we n  just  give the numbers of of    o one of  out of s  sev project manager: Yeah . user interface:  it's  easier to  to do the th things that are like that on a computer . project manager: But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well . project manager: Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , still I think  if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . project manager: So you can also try to  reach the younger people by  putting fancy covers on on the market . marketing: Yeah , I think then it would be way more  popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . I didn't get a message from the from ending of the user interface: I believe y  project manager: Oh I think I have one now . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: marketing: project manager: Export as picture , I think . So  project manager: Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents marketing: Yeah , it probably will . marketing: Oh yeah , you're supposed to make a final project manager: And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . marketing: Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? user interface:  maybe we have to fill  another questionnaire "

        "Query": "Why did the Industrial Designer disagree with Marketing and User Interface on various design aspects of the product?",
        "Summary": "The marketing team suggested that the remote control should have only one button and be compatible with Windows media center, allowing it to operate multiple devices simultaneously. However, the industrial designer disagreed, stating that additional buttons, such as play, fast forward, and stop, would be necessary for a video player. The industrial designer also proposed using titanium for a tough and stylish cover, appealing to older customers. They emphasized the importance of using real titanium instead of titanium-like plastic or compromising the LCD screen. The industrial designer also raised questions about the remote control's universality and programmability, suggesting the need for different modes to send out signals. They also considered the size of the remote, given the complexity of integrating various technical parts. Ultimately, the industrial designer proposed an integrated material approach to reduce costs.",
        "Article": "I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So  here we have our detailed design meeting where we will  look at the prototype and  right so  , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary marketing: project manager: and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go  just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . user interface: project manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So  basically the moral of the story from our last minute  last meeting was that  we that we had meetings from  we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer ,  or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here  and what sort of limitations we're operating with   excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with  voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape  because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .  , and  the   the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . What's to be said about it ?  , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting ,  . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see project manager: This is going to be the on off button project manager: industrial designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels  and then two volume buttons down here , d  we decided those were the most important  buttons . And then , for the more advanced  functions there is a slide out panel here  and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away ,  . As far as the  whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , user interface: marketing: Ah . user interface: industrial designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . user interface: No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about  you know the the interchangeable  faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here marketing:  . user interface: of course that's  interchangeable industrial designer: user interface: and  I think it would be desirable for the  for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued marketing:  'kay . user interface:  and as you can see on the television there  we have the  voice detector device  on the top there .  , what other things do we see here , well ,  if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , project manager: user interface: so I think that will work well with regards to our market .  and  let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available .   do you have anything else to add to that ? industrial designer:  I worried about the materials , it is  the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable  , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .  , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . user interface: It's actually important to note that the television ,  you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the  the company's name on the telephone screen , project manager: Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok industrial designer: I thought that was kinda nice . marketing: project manager: industrial designer: This user interface: marketing: Do we need to worry about  rot factors ? project manager: user interface:  it's encased in a new  type of  marketing: Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: we don't need to worry , industrial designer: We got a bit ahead of ourselves , user interface: It's fine . industrial designer: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but user interface:  . user interface: but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , project manager: Brilliant . user interface:  I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that  whether we need to worry about any  other marketing areas or anything of that nature . This cost well to put this into  production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro  and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . industrial designer: One thing that we didn't do  obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and  since we did that marketing:  . industrial designer: we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . industrial designer: So even though it has a lot of modern technology ,  for example the voice recognition , marketing:  . industrial designer: in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and  I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers  we might be able to get even cheaper . Did we talk about the voice recognition  option ? industrial designer: And Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? user interface: So  so  yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition   console project manager: marketing: Okay . user interface: but basically the voice recognition  incorporates  the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw  come up with . industrial designer: Any questions ? project manager: No , no marketing: Do we have  other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? project manager: I think that's user interface: marketing: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? industrial designer: do you wanna answer this one marketing: Do we know where we stand on that yet ? industrial designer: or do you want me to answer it ? user interface: Well we didn't quite have enough material  . user interface: Oh I see , marketing: I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet . industrial designer: well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and  it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like marketing: Okay . marketing: And the whole thing project manager: marketing: Okay user interface: So  there are I marketing: Right user interface: we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look  materials marketing: Yeah . We also continued on with the ideas that f following  Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the  light orange and the green . industrial designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough marketing: Okay . industrial designer: that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way marketing: Okay .  , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it ,  I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . project manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's a solar cell thing right ? industrial designer: Right project manager: With a back-up battery ? industrial designer:  we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , project manager: With the ba okay .  so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a  It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah .  and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that be the general industrial designer: Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say . Push button interface  with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? industrial designer: Yeah , And  a special I guess it's  we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , industrial designer: Yeah , special . industrial designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , project manager: Yeah , it's it's quite unique . project manager: I like it , yeah it's So it looks like marketing: M come in at sixteen ? project manager: a bit over budget ,  . Huh , doesn't match up does it ? user interface: marketing: project manager: So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells  or take out the back-up battery .  industrial designer: How do you feel about that ? user interface:  I think that  if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . industrial designer:  we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working user interface: project manager: industrial designer: it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the  to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , marketing: Nah . project manager: it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way .  if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it ,  user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental  obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . user interface:  you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing marketing:  user interface:  that's what sets us apart marketing: Which , it's user interface: right ? marketing: yeah that's what setting us into this young market ,  that's where we started from , so I don't know , and  you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . user interface: And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the  the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here marketing: Right . user interface: and  you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here project manager: It's either or . industrial designer: It's the only way we're gonna get below our  goal isn't it ? Of twelve fifty . project manager: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're industrial designer: Yeah , . marketing: It kind of project manager:  and we can't get rid of the   removing the user interface: Savings . project manager: changing the case wouldn't be so much of a - , nor would changing the case materials .  , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . project manager: That'd be great industrial designer: user interface: marketing: I didn't even do that one on purpose either , user interface: marketing: damn . Okay , basically I was just evaluating  from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important .  so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ?  . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . marketing: the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface ,  that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . It looks like it's going over well , so user interface: And the paging function works well , industrial designer: Six ? user interface: that's good to hear , marketing: we're we're good yeah . It's I think eventually if we do  branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into  wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good . industrial designer: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel marketing: That's everything from me . marketing: Yeah , it is a set-back , but industrial designer: marketing: Okay , do you need the cord back ? project manager:  yeah , user interface: W we might have  we might have lost that granola market again project manager: I was just go on . user interface: that we're project manager: Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ? industrial designer: True .  so I guess we are going to discuss  our project process  marketing: industrial designer: user interface: project manager: and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go   out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess ,  . industrial designer: Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or marketing: Okay . marketing: It is now , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: you're in charge there you go . so user interface: project manager: But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . project manager:  right ,  so any thoughts ? industrial designer: Are we considering these points here ? marketing:  . project manager: What do you guys feel about the process ? industrial designer: marketing: you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , project manager: and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . We could now if that'd make up for it user interface: And marketing: but really industrial designer: marketing: and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . user interface: also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . marketing: Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual industrial designer: Yeah , it's true . project manager: marketing: Yeah , but I didn't get a response industrial designer: What if you get a response two or three months from now ? user interface: marketing: so project manager: marketing: we'll see . industrial designer: marketing: Well user interface: industrial designer: marketing: what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: I so n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , I don't we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us ,  . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: marketing: And highly resourceful team mates might I add industrial designer: project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: industrial designer: I guess user interface: industrial designer: My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , project manager: user interface: marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . industrial designer: At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , project manager: marketing: Do your own . marketing: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . marketing:  maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . marketing: Nothing , I didn't even get an email , user interface: marketing: like industrial designer: marketing: that was it . So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . user interface: Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to marketing: Whatever . user interface: well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing industrial designer:  . industrial designer: You know user interface:  and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was marketing:  . user interface: but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , industrial designer: Yeah . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you user interface: which was fine . industrial designer: 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . project manager: She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it . That's kind of a good thing though , project manager: I felt like I slipped into it a lot . user interface: An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? project manager: The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . project manager: it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , user interface: project manager: you know ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: marketing: and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , industrial designer: user interface: I had to admit , as soon as w we started  as soon as we got the Play-Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . industrial designer: project manager: Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , user interface: Possibly . project manager: like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos user interface: Oh yeah , marketing: Yeah . project manager:  you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: I think so . user interface: project manager: No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , industrial designer: You don't . project manager: I don't I I was just I marketing: Though we didn't actually  other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It's true huh ? marketing: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . user interface: I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like  . industrial designer: project manager: It d marketing: Yeah that is kind of project manager: But yeah . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ?  the whole process of industrial designer: Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? project manager: I don't know . I I don't know if there was a ri I th marketing: Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , industrial designer: Yeah , that's it marketing: I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . industrial designer: 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , project manager: Nor I . marketing:  I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't . user interface:  it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . project manager: I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized marketing: I know . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because user interface: marketing: I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . user interface: So is this all we need to get through ? project manager: I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . user interface: Is it marketing: It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? project manager: Well , that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , marketing: That slide was like that ? project manager: user interface: Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? project manager: W I kinda like th industrial designer: No , none . user interface: project manager: Yeah you can't industrial designer: I think they're fine actually . marketing: I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form project manager: Yeah . project manager: Does kinda make you wonder , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , you can marketing: It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , project manager: Yeah . user interface: What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ? project manager: So this was other costs . I think this is marketing: Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? project manager: forty ish marketing: How much time do we have left ? project manager: I I I  we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval ,  . project manager: you know what is marketing: Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work project manager: Yep . marketing: and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway user interface: Why ? project manager: Hey . marketing: like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . industrial designer: Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . user interface: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation industrial designer: Yeah . I di user interface: Oh I added like five slides too , marketing: See project manager: Oh . industrial designer: I just got blank ones project manager: What ? Really ? industrial designer: and marketing: My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe user interface: Yeah , mine too . project manager: yeah they didn't come like this ? Like with this was what it looks like . This is what that looked like , marketing: Like with those words already on it ? project manager: literally , just like that . user interface: I added many slides every time marketing: Hey industrial designer: marketing: with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . project manager: industrial designer: I think it would fail , I think marketing: I can't just leave it there . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . marketing: I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . user interface: Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to  fr some other design  modifications . user interface: I hope you appreciate the  incorporation of some tin foil from a  random Kit-Kat bar project manager: marketing: I I noticed that . industrial designer: Yeah , it's  user interface: So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . You know from the the the basics to the conce industrial designer: I wanna see a marketing: I Yeah . project manager: although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . project manager: yeah  i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . project manager: maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea . industrial designer: So we have more slides or ? marketing: project manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it marketing: We got it to be . project manager: We did the project evaluation based on  Sarah's evaluation of on off switches marketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of , project manager: and marketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . marketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us . project manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . marketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that project manager: Oh yeah . project manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . user interface: What the uhs and the marketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . industrial designer: Filler words or ? project manager: Yep , they're called  disfluencies . industrial designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , so  I do the marketing: Yeah , we are addicts . user interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are project manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . project manager: No we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know  ubiquitous marketing: I yeah . marketing: But it's not regular  my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still . user interface: In the eighties ? marketing: My  grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had  an E_D_U_ and gov network . marketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't  household to household yet user interface: Right . marketing: because it hadn't been user interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something . project manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: Where do you find that ? marketing: I have no idea . user interface: industrial designer: Is that the only song you have ? user interface: There is another one . project manager: Is this one of those media player ? industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Huh ? project manager: W oh . project manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it  shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . marketing: So is that a close ? project manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner "

        "Query": "Why did the team have doubts about relying solely on speech recognition and eliminating buttons for the remote control? What challenges did they face in implementing speech recognition in the new remote controls?",
        "Summary": "Age group data for remote control use was not available, but it is acknowledged that many people may not want to learn how to use a new remote control. Despite this, certain buttons such as channel control, volume settings, and on/off are still necessary. The Industrial Designer raised concerns about the size and bulkiness of remote controls with too many buttons, while a small and slim design was deemed prone to being lost. The User Interface suggested a PDA or hand-held type of remote control, but this was deemed unfriendly in terms of unit price. Marketing expressed concerns about the cost and price implications of implementing voice recognition, arguing that the elderly would not find it user-friendly compared to an LCD screen. The Project Manager agreed with Marketing's opinion and prioritized the LCD screen over voice recognition. The Project Manager also noted the difficulty of implementing speech recognition in remotes due to noise interference, which was expensive to solve. However, the User Interface proposed a solution involving a signal-emitting device built into the TV and a microphone and transmitter on the remote control, utilizing subtractive cancellation of noise.",
        "Article": " I think we  made some definite progress at the last one  and come up with some interesting   w suggestions for our our new remote control .  the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly  and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better .  they've got lots of buttons on them that  people don't use and find difficult to learn . And We we thought that f for our our new   remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy ,  that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That  we want to go for  a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the   the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_  as  a trendy remote control , and and B_ as  a Real Reaction product . So that w  when people are  happy with that , they will they will want to buy  everything else from us . So again  , I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then  we'll we'll make a a final a final  decision .  and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are  what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use   a a a long lasting one . And  I I think our discussion was around the fact that  if we're gonna go for  a long lasting power supply , then basically it's  sealed for life and  if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . And  it it'll be  , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's   , you know , for life , guaranteed for life .  now the the the internal chip  and  this is where I need   Kate's expert advice industrial designer: project manager: and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible  d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ?   I'm I'm I'm n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . And then the  , you know , the the overall design of the case  is is is Kendra's field and  user interface: industrial designer: project manager: we we had some discussions last time as as to  how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those  da today .  and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p  go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both .  and then  , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the  ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and   p perhaps you'd like to start  k .  basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated  into  light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ .  the materials we're gonna need to look at  the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip  works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator ,  two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor .  basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and  which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which  changes the channels .  so as for how we should end up  using this in our remote  t couple of main questions are the buttons .  y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need .  however  to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and  raise the production cost . Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that  they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most  cost-effective way of producing it .  also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that  will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea .  we also need to look at the chips ,  v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all  seem to have agreed upon .  , however that's gonna cost more , but  the off the shelf is gonna be  cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like  voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to  to convert , project manager: Okay , industrial designer: so if we were  definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design  our own chip . project manager:  d d d okay ,   inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . project manager: And and do we know how long it'll take to  develop a a custom chip . Oh w yeah , we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , project manager: Right , industrial designer: it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , project manager: okay . project manager: that would appear to  effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology .   now before we go round everybody else , does anybody  h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? user interface: I I just have a question about that .  does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you  can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites  industrial designer: W just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . user interface: and that w industrial designer: Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . project manager: Cause  I must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . project manager: I d d for slightly different well no , it's if you you speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so  bu  the this this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ? industrial designer:  bits of it , yeah . project manager: So  user interface: Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , industrial designer: Yes , as well . project manager: Yeah ,  true , again but if it's without any without any  p price informations that's  difficult to  industrial designer: project manager:  decide . marketing: Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so . It's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is .   I su i  if given that the  the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before ,  th th the double risk ,  perhaps we ought to  stick to  to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Thoughts ? user interface: Well , another thought I marketing: Would user interface: oh , sorry , go ahead . marketing: Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like  maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . project manager:  do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? industrial designer:  it's fundament well  I guess it it's something we've discussed  since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the  the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to project manager:  I think we user interface: Oh yeah . industrial designer: user interface: Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . user interface: Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . marketing:  yeah , it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . project manager: if if that means  if that means we can't afford buttons but  b b industrial designer:  project manager: second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can  j j just sit there pressing buttons ? user interface: Yeah . Sorry , d did you want to say anything ? No ? industrial designer:  nope , project manager: Okay . Is it gonna work ? project manager:  yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , it's thinking about it . user interface: so I did some research on the internet and  what you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users ,  commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . user interface: and these were just a couple examples of  different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . user interface: There're some special ones available , like this one right here , project manager: -huh . user interface: and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like . industrial designer: user interface: So just kind of minimise the clutter , project manager: user interface: avoid too many buttons and also  one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , marketing:  . user interface: and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . project manager:  I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable . I  , I think it's just sort of the the there's a lot of slide buttons out there . user interface: Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down industrial designer:  . user interface: so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Three buttons , channel up channel up down and user interface: Y yes , yes . marketing: Well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . Because if it if you no user interface: marketing: if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what  , up like one unit , if you see what  . marketing: So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something .  user interface: The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel . project manager: This one on the one side and one marketing:  you could you could as l as like a mouse you could project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Ye yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , project manager: Yeah . project manager: or yeah  th th the  thi this is what the user interface: That was marketing: Yeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , with a project manager: we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know  know what it's going to do . project manager: Okay , so we we're looking at sliders for both a  volume and channel change user interface:  well project manager: of one sort . user interface: I was thinking kind of just for the volume , project manager: Just for the volume ,  . user interface: but what what do you guys think ? marketing: Dep I dunno if it user interface: We could marketing: depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: 'cause if yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , project manager: It yeah ,  it it it seems to me that  it  it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , user interface: B industrial designer: just the way it would user interface: Yeah . project manager: that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo user interface: Yes . marketing: The data's come off internet  from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . industrial designer: marketing: And  the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel project manager: This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , project manager:  . So  and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , so  project manager: Well I  I th I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those .  yeah , and  from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . industrial designer: project manager:  I hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly . But  I was gonna say  yeah , project manager: What ? marketing: fruit and vegetables ,  important to this year  important to furniture , I'm just gonna say  f like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . industrial designer: Well that can kinda tie into our changing  face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year marketing:  . project manager: industrial designer: and  whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: and then we can just whip that off and industrial designer: yeah . You know , that kind of spongy industrial designer: yeah , that weird I dunno what that is , project manager:  .  you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have  a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . user interface: project manager: I  it its  I that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where   on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , industrial designer:  . user interface: Wh project manager: yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity industrial designer: I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . project manager: W  we we can   b but  my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . project manager:  but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better . user interface: So  industrial designer: That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers user interface: like industrial designer: and yeah . project manager: I n I know the only p  the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection user interface: So f project manager: and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together industrial designer:  yeah . project manager: but  I d I I  I know what you're saying and  understand where you're coming from . marketing: Or well , but like  like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you've only got like , you know like th  this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip industrial designer: And then project manager: I th I s I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about  even if it costs slightly more than that ,  just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs marketing: Yeah , you probably are right . project manager:  and , you know giving people the option of buying a new  a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work  totally . project manager:  then if , you know , if people lose the cover ,  they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one  rather than a a complete new re remote . industrial designer: Well that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . project manager: Yeah ,  it is it's up to it's up to industrial designer: So , user interface: Yeah , just another five Euro to get industrial designer: yeah . project manager: it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . project manager:  and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . project manager: And  industrial designer: And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . user interface: Yeah , like they have for mobile phones industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly .  we hadn't finished your marketing:  oh , don't worry it's all said , I was just gonna say  yeah , are we gonna make this as part of like like  a part of the f like it it the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? project manager: It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their  coffee table to say this says something about me . marketing: with project manager: I , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design ,  you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory .  , so  the the the basic shape i is is what we   given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for  channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , industrial designer:  . And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but  know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: you know , t to deliberately get away from the    you know , the the the the square look of most  current  remotes industrial designer:  . project manager: and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow .   or  'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently  displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those . industrial designer: I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , project manager: Yeah  the the  or or b industrial designer: but I'd user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: yellow seems a bit of a strong colour user interface: like an . project manager: Yeah , I'd I'd  industrial designer: to make the ent like the thing user interface: Yeah .  no industrial designer: no , but  just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . project manager: I d I I agree ,  we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently  . user interface: Well n project manager: Well , th this is this is the whole point , yes , you know , I'm I've got a a Real Reaction  remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: And  then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff . user interface: Well I was sort of  kinda picturing like maybe  a shape that's almost like a mouse . user interface: So that , you know , when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand  maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and project manager: Yeah . project manager: Oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though user interface: Kind of a c industrial designer: 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . project manager: W it  well it's sort of it's it's sort of  a a mouse , industrial designer: So maybe it'd be user interface: Yeah . project manager: but held , you know , so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons . user interface: Yeah so yeah , kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had industrial designer: Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: and you can fiddle user interface: then wider up here . user interface: And then it would have a l  wider thing to  have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . marketing: Yeah , that sounds  I'm just I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to .  are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . project manager: we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that  yeah . industrial designer: But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that project manager: Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it , industrial designer: and it's microphone-esque , user interface: Yeah , and just say project manager: yeah , yeah . marketing: Yeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , industrial designer:  . project manager: I th I th honest  my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway  . marketing:  I suppose , but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing . project manager: It's cer it's certainly possible  , but they we we're going beyond w w industrial designer: Bu  . project manager: given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work  .   if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness project manager:  marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: and and sc marketing: that's a good idea . industrial designer: and then you can you can minimise the buttons user interface: Yeah , I suppose I sup industrial designer: and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . project manager: If we we're  I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . industrial designer: Yeah user interface: We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . project manager:    marketing: project manager: Okay , if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . Do we need some sort of display ? industrial designer: But the television would be the display project manager: We actually use the television , okay . industrial designer: that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu user interface: Yeah , and then y industrial designer: and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah . marketing: on a onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . user interface: Yeah , press that is t industrial designer: I never understood how that worked though , user interface: yeah , that might work . user interface: Yeah , it's like  yeah , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . user interface: Yeah , and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . project manager: so  I d I think we've actually very conveniently just  come to  a good point to s to sum up  . project manager: So  b b Kate and Kendra now go away and  pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , industrial designer: Play with play-dough . industrial designer: project manager:  and actually put what we've discussed into something  I was gonna say concrete , marketing:  . project manager: but that's a slightly inappropriate word industrial designer: project manager:  to something that we can we can see and  Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can  actually market this as a concept and not j not just a   a a simple remote control . marketing: Our energy source is gonna be project manager: I think I think we decided that we're gonna for marketing: long term . project manager: for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and  maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source  , industrial designer:  .  project manager: I you know , on the basis that  that , you know , if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then  people are more likely to change it anyway  before i it runs out and  make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for  we'll say at least five five ten years marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And we're having a custom chip ? project manager: We're having a a custom chip , but given the the we've cut the functions down ,  that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that  technol technological innovation is important , industrial designer: project manager: then we need to , I'll say it again , technologically innovate . marketing: project manager:  and  we we , know , we must resist any efforts to  to try and water that down  . marketing: And interchangeable case ? project manager: I i interchangeable case seems to be   important to the concept . project manager:  it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . project manager: And  i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it  to whatever they want , then     this is totally new . project manager: We d we don't know whether that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of  covers that they can use anyway , and  and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then  you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to  a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names , industrial designer: marketing: project manager:  it's  it's good for the supermarket user interface: project manager: and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better . marketing: And  are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or project manager:  the that  that's no , because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant . user interface: Yeah , and especially for making them so like different and industrial designer:  different to feel , project manager: Yeah , yeah . project manager: you know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , industrial designer: project manager: so no ,  given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually   unnecessary I think . marketing: Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just project manager: As  as wide industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and  it's  you know , i i it will work most of the time  . project manager: Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work . industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  yeah ,  I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the  the infrared  . project manager: Yeah , 'cause  the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , so if if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes "

        "Summary": "The professor expressed his frustration with the constant delays in the TORRENT chip schedule. Grad F presented his proposal, focusing on the section on intermediate categories and suggesting the inclusion of features from these categories as a means of reducing error. The professor was particularly interested in understanding the impact of the neural net on older models that lacked pure features. While acknowledging the potential for improvement, he also cautioned against overusing nets.",
        "Article": "phd a: And what was that , Morgan ? What project ? professor b: the , TORRENT chip . professor b: we went through it Jim and I went through old emails at one point and and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're we 're two months away from being done . phd a: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we go around and do , status report kind of things ? OK . phd a: Any objection ? Do y OK , M professor b: All in favor phd a: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or ? professor b: I don't do anything . I No , I I 'm involved in discussions with with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ? grad f: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ? phd a: OK . Well , this past week I 've just been , getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal . I just finished a section on ,  on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , as a as a middle step . And , I hope to hope to get this ,  a full rough draft done by , Monday so I can give it to Morgan . phd a: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and ? grad f: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . phd a: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any a little bit about it , grad f: Y s phd a: or ? Mmm .  , a little bit about ? phd a: Wh - what you 're what you 're gonna You said you were talking about the , particular features that you were looking at , grad f: Oh , the the phd a: or grad f: Right . Well , I was , I think one of the perplexing problems is , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away .  , build a system that , classifies these ,  these feat  , these intermediate categories using , multi - band techniques . Look at then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . phd a: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ? grad f: for that for that part of the the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT . grad f: that 's that 's ,  that 's just the ph the phone recognition task . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , something like Schw - Switchboard , where I 'd I would be able to ,  to model , intermediate categories that span across phonemes , phd a:   grad f: not just within the phonemes , themselves , and then do the same process there , on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard .  , and for that for that part I would I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for for Switchboard . phd a: It 's about a month from now ? grad f: It 's a it 's a month and and a week . phd a: So , you want to go next , Dave ? And we 'll do grad e: Oh . And , we we got an improvement , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , six percent to four point five percent , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , the near - mike performance worsened , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , wh why would that be , considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , with some input from , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts .  , first of all HTK sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't .  , so this ,  This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone , depending on the timing of the echo . So , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . professor b: I had another thought just now , which is , remember we were talking before about we were talking in our meeting about , this stuff that some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , getting rid of low - energy sections ?  , if you if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , and , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing .  , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , at n And , what if you did ?  , there 's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . professor b: And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing grad e:   professor b: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , very low or or near zero value .  , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are ,  grad e:  - huh . professor b: or pre - echoes , whichever they are are are , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them . professor b: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech . phd g: what is the reverberation time like there ? grad e: In thi in this room ?  phd g: On , the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like ? grad e: Y Yeah . professor b: so it 's these are just microphone this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on . I think it 's I would guess , point seven , point eight seconds f  , R T grad f:  ! professor b: something like that ? But it 's you know , it 's this room . But the other thing is , he 's putting in w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways . He 's also putting in , a he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't . professor b: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away .  , and if it 's a low energy compo portion , you might actually hear some funny things . grad e: O o one thing , I noticed is that , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them . I don't see why why your signal is louder after processing , because yo grad e: Yeah . professor b: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .  , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio . phd c: Well , well professor b: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . professor b: But just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio grad e: It w i i it wouldn't affect things . phd c: Well , the system is use the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on on the signal level . professor b: So if the if the if you change in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect . phd a: Did you add this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ? grad e:   . Did I w what ? phd a: Well , Morgan was just saying that , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect . But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder . If it 's if it 's like , if it 's trying to find a a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter .  , there 's there 's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing , grad e: Nuh - huh . phd a: I wonder if there could be something like ,  for s for the PZM data , phd c: Eh phd a: you know , if occasionally , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the ,  you know , doing the mean normalization where , it it could cause you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . It it i maybe i If ,  Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger . professor b: So , it 's it 's just a a question of there 's It it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it grad e:   professor b: y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . So , you trained it on TI - digits ? But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on Macrophone . Right ? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . grad e: If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system . So you use VTL -  , vocal tract length normalization and , like MLLR transformations also , grad e:   phd c: and professor b: I 'm sorry , was his point eight percent , er , a a result on testing on Macrophone or or training ? phd c: all that stuff . grad e: That 's phd c: It was training on Macrophone and testing yeah , on on meeting digits . I I 've just been text testing the new Aurora front - end with well , Aurora system actually so front - end and HTK , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . professor b: So , what w ? phd c: And phd g: With the with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ? phd c: Yeah . phd g: I know in the meeting , like phd c: On the meeting we have two point seven . phd c: we have the new LDA filters , and I think , maybe I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation .  , eh Do y did you have a look at at the meet  , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or ? grad e: I I didn't .  , any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it . professor b: typi you know , unless Actually , there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to DC . And you can get , I think it was I think it was in the Wall Street Journal data that that I can't remember , one of the DARPA things . professor b: we didn't we didn't know about for a while , while we were messing with it . And , the interesting thing that I tried was , Adam and Morgan had this idea , since my original attempts to , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work .  , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , problems with , the arithmetic of phases . They they add in this modulo two pi way and , there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct . So , what I did instead is I took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , and I subtracted that phase off to normalize . professor b: You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , and he 's really got something . phd a: Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ? professor b: Ex - exactly . phd g: Oh , it 's professor b: Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite . I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because this is also one big difference between the two systems .  , the other differences were the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more SRI system are more complex . But , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and phd a: It didn't seem to help in the HTK system . professor b: Well , it sounds like they also have he he 's saying they have all these , different kinds of adaptation . phd a: Like they do ,  I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits , phd c: The vocal tr phd a: but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's ,  conversation - side normalization for the non - C - zero components , phd c: Yeah . phd c: So , it might be it might be better with it might be worse if the channel is constant , phd a: Yeah . phd g: And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or or is it the whole word ? phd c: SRI it 's it 's tr grad f: SRI . So there 's there 's these kind of , pooled models and and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies . professor b: They have tied states and I think I I I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . And maybe see with Andreas if Well , I I don't know how much it helps , what 's the model . phd a: So so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ? phd c: That 's right . grad e: You know , the the Aurora baseline is set up with these ,  this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter , and , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which don't have this filter . professor b: So is that ?  , are are these results comparable ? So you you were getting with the , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent on clean TI - digits , when , training the SRI system with clean TR digits TI - digits . And , so , is your two point seven comparable , where you 're , using , the submitted system ? phd c: Yeah . grad e: W w it was one one point two phd c: Ye grad e: with the SRI system , professor b: I 'm sorry . professor b: OK , so the comparable number then ,  for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the  , two point f phd c: It was four point something . Right ? The HTK system with , b grad e: D d professor b: Oh , right , right , right , right . phd c: MFCC features grad e: Do you mean the b ? The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent . And another thing I I maybe would like to do is to just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone test it on , the noisy TI - digits , professor b: Yeah . But I wonder if it 's just because maybe Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than than TI - digit is , which is TI - digits are very clean recorded digits professor b:   phd c: and phd a: You know , it would also be interesting to see ,  to do the regular Aurora test , phd c: f s phd a: but use the SRI system instead of HTK . phd c: So we don't professor b: You 'd have to train the SRI system with with all the different languages . phd a: So , like , comple professor b: It 'd be a lot of work . phd a: I guess the work would be into getting the the files in the right formats , or something . phd a: Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're ,  you 're also training on all the data . professor b: That 's true , but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things phd a:   professor b: because on on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK . professor b: So , it 's it 's a good idea , but it seems like it makes sense to do some pruning phd a:   professor b: first with a a test or two that makes sense for you , phd a: Yeah . But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information about what 's going on .  , the next thing is this this VAD problem that ,  So , I 'm just talking about the the curves that I I sent I sent you so , whi that shows that when the SNR decrease , the current VAD approach doesn't drop much frames for some particular noises , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , acoustically . I They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries . First of all , the boundaries might be ,  like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or before and after speech . professor b: Do we ?  , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ? phd c: And No . professor b: But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when when , the gang gets back from Crete . professor b: And then the thing is if if they really are going to have some means of giving us fairly tight , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue . phd g: Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . And then , like , if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , the way we want professor b:   phd g: to find a  , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us . phd g: But if that is going to be something like a manual , segmenter , then we can't use that information anymore , phd c:   phd g: because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation . There 's an  , I think it 's still for even for the evaluation , it might still be interesting to work on this because the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , starting of speech and end of speech  , at the utterance level . phd c: So phd g: with some pauses in the center , provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking . professor b: So if you could get at some of that ,  phd c: So professor b: although that 'd be hard . It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other things that we want to work on . So I did I just started to test putting together two VAD which was was not much work actually .  , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , energy - based VAD that , the other Aurora guys use . phd c: and , detect detecting the first group of four frames that have a energy that 's above this threshold , and , from this point , tagging the frames there as speech . And it really removes it , still o on the noises where our MLP VAD doesn't work a lot . phd c: professor b: Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral information , phd c: and professor b: you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance  , would give you some better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or or ,  stop consonants , or something like that . So , your point is will be to u use whatever professor b: Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and nonspeech . professor b: just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , some sort of slope . And and most , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a a high - pass kind of characteristic phd c:   professor b: you know , at the beginning of a of a of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy , phd c:   Whereas , a a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency .  , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , but it plus energy is sort of phd c: Yeah . professor b: if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of what they were using then . It it might be that what I did is so , removes like low ,  low - energy , speech frames . Because the way I do it is I just I just combine the two decisions so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based with the with the and operator . So if the energy - based dropped dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they they are they are lost . phd c: But s still , the way it 's done right now it it helps on on the noises where it seems to help on the noises where our VAD was not very good . But but , I guess what you 're saying is that the the MLP - based one has the spectral information . professor b: Well , you can imagine phd c: The way I use a an a \" AND \" operator is So , it I ,  professor b: Is ? phd c: The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are are , dropped , even if the , MLP decides to keep them . phd a: No professor b: but  , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a  , a probability estimated by each one and and put them together . phd a: Something that that I 've used in the past is ,  when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . phd a: But , I 'm I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . phd c: Well , actually if I don't maybe don't want to work too much of on it right now . I just wanted to to see if it 's what I observed was the re was caused by this this VAD problem .  , which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , twenty - five experiments , with different , values for the parameters that are used . So , it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more , noise than the noise spectra that is estimated on the noise portion of the s  , the utterances . And after subtraction , I also add a constant noise , and I also try different , noise , values and we 'll see what happen . But st still when we look at the ,  Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . On the other hand , when you subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but maybe you distort a lot of speech . So the next thing , maybe I what I will try to to do is just to try to smooth mmm , the ,  to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or phd g: Can smooth the SNR estimate , also . So , to get something that 's would be closer to what you tried to do with Wiener filtering . phd c: It phd g: And it 's phd c: Maybe you can phd g: go ahead . And there are there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was I was assuming that always the VAD  , the initial frames were silence . So the it wasn't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence . phd c: So , in some cases s there are also phd g: SpeechDat - Car Italian . And , so once it was cleared , I ran a few experiments with different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the the trend seems to be like , smoothing the current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the estimating the the More smoothing is helping . And , so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So , one is fixed in the line , like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , SNR , because that if some In some cases the clean speech is , like when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't vary a lot in the low - energy regions . The results are , like So far I 've been testing only with the baseline , which is which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , just the spectral  , the mel sp mel , frequency coefficients . And the other thing that I tried was but I just took of those , Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . And it 's it seems to be like it 's not hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a four hertz a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So there must be something that I can that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which I guess I would ask Carlos about that .  , how how he derived those filters and and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll professor b: This is cubic root of power spectra ? phd g: Yeah . professor b: So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . phd g: So it has , like the spectrogram has , like  , it actually , enhances the onset and offset of  , the the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions , professor b:   phd g: So , those are the regions where there are , like when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . There are a few very not a lot of because the filter doesn't have a really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll I 'll Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and but while making this Wiener filter better . professor b: last week you were also talking about building up the subspace stuff ? phd g: Yeah . I I I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . phd a: How about you , Carmen ? phd d: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy . professor b:  ? phd d: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then we decided that that 's it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . I don't hav I don't this is I didn't do the experiment yet to apply VTS in cepstral domain . professor b: The other thing is So so , in i i and Not and C - zero would be a different So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway .  , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have two kinds of normalization with with , different time constants . So , you could do some normalization s  , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . phd d: Well , we s decide to m to to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot It 's a lot of work . phd d: And I want to know if if we have some feeling that the result I I would like to know if I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel in filter bank domain . Well , you 're I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . phd c: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the level of the speech signal . phd d: Yeah ? phd c: And So I expect it If if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to it to , be a better model of speech . And then you have one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level , phd d:   phd d: Ye phd c: Because it 's like first doing general normalization phd d: Yea phd c: and then noise removal , which is phd d: Yeah . We I was thinking to to to estimate the noise with the first frames and then apply the VAD , professor b:   phd d: We we see Well , I am thinking about that and working about that , professor b: Yeah .  , one of the things we 've talked about maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their characteristics are , phd d:  -  "

        "Query": "What were the key points discussed by the group regarding the style, design optimization, design goal, evaluation criteria, features, and use cases of the remote control?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the integration of remote controls for different appliances into one, but Marketing raised concerns about the excessive number of buttons and suggested incorporating a menu display instead. The Project Manager and User Interface agreed, but insisted on keeping basic buttons as well. However, the idea of a flip top was rejected due to cost considerations. As a temporary solution, lightweight plastic was chosen as the material. The team aimed to create an original, trendy, user-friendly, durable, creative, and characteristic remote control that would be intuitive for users. They also determined the price, cost, and expected profit of the remote control. Creativity was emphasized, with the goal of introducing fashion into electronics without compromising functionality. Marketing emphasized the need for a fashionable, technologically innovative, easy-to-use, customer-friendly, uncomplicated, functional, and ergonomically-friendly remote control. The Project Manager agreed and added that it should be quick to learn how to use. User Interface highlighted the importance of channel switching and suggested keeping the remote control as basic as possible. Marketing proposed that the remote control should be multipurpose to compete with existing products. The Project Manager agreed to explore innovative use cases and suggested operating different devices such as TVs, video recorders, and DVD players with the remote control.",
        "Article": " we will start with the  Manager Expert wi who will talk about  user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . marketing: Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted  into  what users want in this remote control . Oh that's okay , it's jus marketing:  so first of all we what we did is we  conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects .  we put them in a in our  usability laboratory and got them to , you know ,  play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire  to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . So basically  the major things we found out was that  basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .  they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we  did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .  they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ .  and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we  tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that  are on remote controls .  so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics  based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control .  and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , while the user's watching T_V_ . industrial designer: project manager: marketing:  the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button ,  which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , all the other , all the other  buttons , such as ch  audio and picture selection  configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour .  we also asked users  which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users ,  note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance .  and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that  w the audio and picture settings were very  weren't very important to them  , and they used them very infrequently a as well . And fifty percent of the users said that  what frustrates them is losing the remote control  somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .  they also said that it  it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface .  and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and  cause u repetitive strain injury . We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition  is a useful feature to have on a remote control . project manager: marketing:  basically our findings are that  amongst a younger age groups  the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . industrial designer: marketing:  for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . Whereas  the the trend was as users as users  became older and older  they were less likely to want these sort of features in a  in a remote control .  and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics ,  I think we're focusing on the younger younger  target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . project manager: So ,  maybe now we can talk about a user interface and  about the technical function of this device . So  Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ? industrial designer: Well , okay , yeah . marketing: Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , industrial designer: marketing: so it's industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . Okay , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for  , for sending some commands by some waves to  another device to to tell different commands  with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device .  first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits  making interface with  keyboard and  r reading  keyboard and reading the keyboard  commands . And then there should be  an electronic circuit making  electronic signals according to these commands and  finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making  making  waves to transmit through the air and   this air this  wave  will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to  r to realise the command . Okay ,  about what I found about  different  these different blocks are  , usually there are two different methods  to for designing a remote control . This is  this can be   the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . And  also as  I understood , and  I think it was a part of  Bob ,   presentation , people prefer to have  to have  the remote control with less button . So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having  some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the  on the remote control . And  personal preferences ,     certainly a remote control with  working with radio waves is  preferred because  you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . marketing: Do you think radio waves  will interfere with other appliances in the home ? user interface: I don't think so , because  we can make  we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home . project manager: So can we use any any frequency ? industrial designer: Yeah , it should be okay . project manager: We have the right to use any frequency ? user interface:  no but as I know , there is a range for  for this  f for for  for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our  transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . And what happen with  radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ? user interface:  for this I'm not  I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting  p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it project manager: Okay . A kind of identification , user interface: Yeah , identification code inside the industrial designer: Yeah f  I know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . So industrial designer: It's  kind of handshaking , when starting to  when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . So industrial designer: So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . A specific  remote control has a specific f industrial designer: Yeah but we we don't have to think  about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made  circuits which we probably bu buy . I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this   in this company .  what  I have to do ? A look at what the other company Okay so  presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because  I didn't work  with these  circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And  I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them .  , okay findings , that's the point that I'm working on currently but  so far I I was  looking what what are the blue circuit ,  radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , marketing: So , I know that  the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can  you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , user interface: industrial designer: but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the  infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . It depends  on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , user interface: industrial designer: because the speech rec Yeah ? marketing: Are we  are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ? industrial designer: No no no no no . This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves . So , speech recognition well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , project manager: industrial designer: so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . industrial designer: But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'm project manager: Or it would be maybe feasible ? industrial designer: Oh . But if we use the L_C_D_  even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and  related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . industrial designer: It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , project manager:  . industrial designer: I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know ,  want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . And  my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view  of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . project manager: Why ? Because it's simpler ? industrial designer: Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . industrial designer: Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy . marketing: What how much more expensive ? Are we talking three times more expensive ? project manager: industrial designer: Well , three to three to five . marketing: Or ten times more expensive ? Or industrial designer: N not ten times , marketing: Okay . marketing: because  all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . project manager: Well I , oh industrial designer: Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know . project manager: we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . marketing: But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . project manager: So  I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . And  Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext .  the second thing is  they suggest that that we should  use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it it makes it's too complex and  because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control .  ,  It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is  , we put fashion of in electronics . So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . So ,  So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this  on this remote control . industrial designer: Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . project manager: Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? industrial designer: You should probably speak . Do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ?  those nine plus one or two ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: I think it would be a b industrial designer: Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . project manager: On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's marketing: Yeah , I user interface: Yeah . project manager: Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like user interface: Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . project manager:  industrial designer: Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . Maybe we could have key buttons , like  discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and industrial designer: You mean like hierarchical structure . project manager: If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . industrial designer: So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you project manager: Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah . marketing: We could maybe also c  incorporate Petre's idea of the  slider for the volume , with the channel . industrial designer: So we are still s speaking about the common devices user interface: industrial designer: or we are inviting the new one ? marketing: I think so . project manager: What about the settings of the T_V_ ? Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway . user interface: we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . Because one solution for this    ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can industrial designer: On the screen , you mean ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: And then marketing: I don't Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones .  this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think . I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_ user interface: W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things . industrial designer: Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price . project manager: So , what are we doing with the settings ? Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but user interface: Yeah . marketing: But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time . marketing:  there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some project manager: Yeah . marketing: So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required . project manager: In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . industrial designer: Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally project manager: It's it's a kind of setting , I think . marketing: well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . project manager: No , I think it's after after five minutes or something a timer industrial designer: Yes . Well I I  project manager: I I think , no ? industrial designer: marketing: But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute industrial designer: project manager: industrial designer: You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . marketing:  based on our usability studies again ,  pe  people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . marketing: you know , it was nine out of ten industrial designer: Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep  keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , marketing: re relevance . industrial designer: we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Because , well it's maybe question for you t marketing: I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , user interface: marketing: which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . marketing:  and all the other f functionality is industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . industrial designer: Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . user interface: industrial designer: Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be project manager: For what ? industrial designer:  power button . marketing: I think it should be a bu industrial designer: If it if it's a button or user interface: Yeah . marketing: S What about things like the clock and  timers ? industrial designer: Do we still have the time ? I I just wonder . Well what w what was the question ? user interface: Clock or marketing: you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display project manager: Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that . industrial designer: Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: no ? Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there . If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ?  , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? user interface:  . project manager: W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better . industrial designer: Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , user interface: project manager: industrial designer: well And based on your user interface: marketing: Very , yeah okay , very occasionally . industrial designer: marketing: But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but user interface:  . industrial designer: Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote . industrial designer: user interface: And  do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? industrial designer: Yes yes . project manager: I think user interface: I I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to  put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . project manager: So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time "

        "Summary": "The company recommends incorporating its corporate colors and design into the product, including the option for different colors like pink or banana yellow and fun shapes such as animals. They also discussed the idea of using buttons with various shapes, like triangles for volume and squares for channels. It was agreed upon that the text on the remote should be clear and the remote itself should be compact. \n\nDuring the discussion, the group realized that balancing the budget and maintaining quality would be challenging. To save costs without compromising user experience, the Project Manager decided to use high-quality recycled plastic as the material for the remote. However, they were willing to invest in a cutting-edge lithium battery for optimal performance.\n\nThe company's slogan and design target revolve around incorporating fashion into electronics. While the idea of providing user-customizable skins was rejected due to the amount of work involved, they decided to add the company logo on the boot-up screen and introduce a dormant mode. This was because most people prefer a non-flashing remote when the TV is on.\n\nThere were two main reasons behind these design choices. Firstly, the unit price of each remote control was relatively high, at twenty-five Euros. To justify this price point, the features of the remote had to be satisfying and of high quality. Secondly, there was competition in the market from other TV remote controls. Therefore, the new remote controls needed to be special and different in order to attract customers.",
        "Article": "First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . user interface: project manager: So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did .  do you have a PowerPoint or no ? user interface: Yeah , it's in the should be in the m Project . marketing: Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or user interface: You know you could you could do it yourself actually .  well , the function of a remote control , as what  we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .  some of the considerations is just  for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like  we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . project manager: user interface: And we can decide if that's what we want ,  if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .  and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , project manager: user interface: and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze ,  slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . user interface: And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . user interface: And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete .  , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . Who would like to  follow that one up ? Now , that we've discussed marketing: I can go . marketing: Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us  if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really  there's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . So user interface: And that meaning what ? marketing: Like They like I guess use the buttons a lot . project manager: What do you mean by  the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . marketing: whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex project manager: Oh , right . marketing: and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , project manager:  . marketing: and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , user interface: S marketing: but  they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . project manager: user interface: Wait , is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? marketing: Sh project manager: Could be , yeah . industrial designer: Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? user interface: Like project manager: Oh . marketing:  yeah , that's what my web site said , I user interface: Channel , volume , power . user interface: It's like if you're holding it marketing: I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . marketing: But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . marketing: Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is .  the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . user interface: marketing: And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . project manager: And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? marketing: I guess so , yeah . marketing: Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . project manager: Didn't they  didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it user interface: It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'm just trying to move it .  I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . industrial designer:  okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . industrial designer: We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . user interface: marketing: What exactly is a smart chip ? industrial designer: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . user interface: Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? industrial designer: I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . user interface: industrial designer:  power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . user interface: industrial designer:  a large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . industrial designer: Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system .  smart chip that perverts  that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch .  extra bulb could just be for flashiness ,  subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device .  the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . marketing: So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? industrial designer: This is just like a rough schematic . project manager: So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? marketing: Oh okay . user interface: Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . project manager: The l the light up kind of industrial designer: Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , marketing: Like that we know the battery's working . industrial designer: 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? project manager:  . project manager: Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ? industrial designer: I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons . user interface: Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like  the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? marketing: I think we should . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , project manager:  . Okay , let's talk about all of our We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's  wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . project manager: in States we don't have it , but  it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , user interface: I know . marketing: What is it ? user interface: project manager: it's very  bland looking , it's just text on the screen , user interface: Yeah , project manager: not even user interface: it's like black , black and white kind of project manager: Yeah , just black with just text . industrial designer: You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so user interface: It'll give you the sports . marketing: Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? project manager: Kind of . project manager: So anyway user interface: You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , industrial designer: Seemingly . marketing: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? project manager: Right . project manager: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements . industrial designer: So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? project manager: Yes . project manager: What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about  the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So our target group is You mentioned  older people ? Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? user interface: project manager: Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically user interface: It's gonna make it nicer .  they want something user-friendly , so industrial designer:  well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so we want  for our target group would we say , young and old , all age ranges , all  , not kids obviously , right ? Or kids ? marketing: No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . project manager: Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range marketing: Yeah , I think we need it all . project manager:  what about technic technical  specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? industrial designer: marketing:  I would say we should say dumber than the average person . industrial designer: how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . And we wanna keep  I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . industrial designer: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? user interface: project manager: I think so . user interface: project manager: A finding kind of device or industrial designer: And marketing: I need we we need a like homing device . industrial designer: like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? user interface: Oh right yeah okay . industrial designer: What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . marketing: Do you think people'll really go for that though ? industrial designer: It's useful for the remote phone . project manager: Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? marketing: I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . user interface: Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . user interface: Well , then we could marketing: Do w user interface: If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled  demo demographic . marketing: Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge project manager: You could  we could hook it up . marketing: It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , project manager: Oh . marketing: They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and industrial designer: project manager: And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has user interface: Well marketing: just sitcoms and stuff . user interface: Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , marketing: So user interface: 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , project manager: Right . user interface: whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ? project manager:  . marketing: Wait , on the remote itself ? project manager: user interface: Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . user interface: Well , I don't know , if you can like well project manager: Unless you could say the channel . user interface: I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ? industrial designer: I think people would find that too foreign . project manager: And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . marketing: You definitely need project manager: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so project manager: 'Kay . user interface: And how do we marketing: I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . project manager: We could just have the logo in yellow , user interface: Can't make it entirely project manager: or maybe a yellow light for the keys . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . So we've simplified , we don't need all those  play , fast-forward , rewind , user interface: Right , yeah . project manager: So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down ,  the numbers Yeah . project manager:  can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those user interface: Two examples . project manager: Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? user interface: Oh , it's a Yeah . marketing: Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? project manager: The T_V_ .  how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? user interface: Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . user interface: and so it's like marketing: Yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . project manager: Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , user interface: I don't well , I don't know . user interface: Well , that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . marketing: Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . project manager: That one ? user interface: So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , project manager: Right . user interface: including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now project manager: In the middle perhaps . Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? industrial designer: I had something , but I forgot . After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail .  I'm gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept ,  U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? No ? Okay , well , this meeting is officially over "

    {
        "Query": "What is the current status of the digits data and what additional assignments were proposed?",
        "Summary": "The test set of digits data, which is almost finished and spans two hours, is nearing completion. Currently, digit extraction has been carried out on approximately half of this data. Moving forward, there are plans to explore the reading of digits in various prosodic groupings as part of future work.",
        "Article": "professor c: So ,  grad f: so I wanted to discuss digits briefly , but that won't take too long . OK , agenda items , we have digits , What else we got ? phd a: New version of the presegmentation . postdoc b: do we wanna say something about the , an update of the , transcript ? phd g: Yeah , why don't you summarize the professor c: Update on transcripts . phd g: And I guess that includes some the filtering for the , the ASI refs , too . professor c: Filtering for what ? phd g: For the references that we need to go from the the fancy transcripts to the sort of brain - dead . postdoc b: It 'll it 'll be basically it 'll be a re - cap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning . OK well , the , w  as you can see from the numbers on the digits we 're almost done . You know , someone fills out the form and then they 're not at the meeting and so it 's blank . And so , once we 're it 's done it would be very nice to train up a recognizer and actually start working with this data . phd d: So we 'll have a corpus that 's the size of TI - digits ? grad f: And so One particular test set of TI - digits . grad f: So , I I extracted , Ther - there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test set . It had been randomized and so on phd d:  grad f: and that 's just what I used to generate the order . professor c: So , I 'm impressed by what we could do , Is take the standard training set for TI - digits , train up with whatever , you know , great features we think we have ,  for instance , and then test on  this test set . grad f:  professor c: And presumably  it should do reasonably well on that , and then , presumably , we should go to the distant mike , and it should do poorly . professor c: And then we should get really smart over the next year or two , and it that should get better . grad f: so that the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that . And so I have a set of scripts and X Waves where you just select the portion , hit R , it tells you what the next one should be , and you just look for that . You know , so it it 'll put on the screen , \" The next set is six nine , nine two two \" . And you find that , and , hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format . professor c: So is this grad f: And so the the question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? Well , some of us . I 've been do I 've done , eight meetings , something like that , just by hand .  professor c: what what do you think ? postdoc b: My feeling is that we discussed this right before coffee and I think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them . And also it is contributing to the , c composition of the transcript cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript . grad f: There is there is professor c: So you think it 's fine to have the transcribers do it ? postdoc b:   grad f: There 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically . grad f: And so it 's just , you know , typing in name , times time , date , and so on .  , which again either they can do , but it is , you know , firing up an editor , or , again , I can do . postdoc b: And , that , you know , I 'm not , that that one I 'm not so sure if it 's into the the , things that , I , wanted to use the hours for , because the , the time that they 'd be spending doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on . postdoc b: But that 's really your choice , it 's your phd d: So are these two separate tasks that can happen ? Or do they have to happen at the same time before grad f: No they don't have this you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they don't have to happen at the same time . grad f: So it 's it 's just I have a file whi which has this information on it , and then when you start using my scripts , for extracting the times , it adds the times at the bottom of the file . And so , it 's easy to create the files and leave them blank , and so actually we could do it in either order . grad f: it 's it 's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double - check , to make sure you 're entering for the right person . Yeah just by way of  , a  , order of magnitude , we 've been working with this Aurora ,  data set . And , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , is about ,  I think the best score was something like five percent , error , per digit . So So the The point there , and this is  car noise  ,  things , but but real real situation , phd d:   professor c: well , \" real \" , the  there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as as this sort of thing , close versus distant .  but in a car , instead of instead of having a projector noise it 's it 's car noise . So , that 's that 's an indication ,  that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth , so . More typical numbers like phd d: Although the models weren't , that good , right ?  , the models are pretty crappy ? professor c: You 're right . I think that we could have done better on the models , but the thing is that we got this this is the kind of typical number , for all of the , things in this task , all of the , languages . Anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . phd d: How did we do on the TI - digits ? grad f: Well the prosodics are so much different s it 's gonna be , strange . grad f: So I 'm I 'm not sure how much of effect that will have . phd d: H how do phd g: What do you mean , the prosodics ? grad f: just what we were talking about with grouping . That with these , the grouping , there 's no grouping at all , and so it 's just the only sort of discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end . phd g: So what are they doing in Aurora , are they reading actual phone numbers , grad f: Aurora I don't know . phd g: or , a a digit at a time , or ? professor c: I 'm not sure how phd g: Cuz it 's professor c: no , no  it 's connected it 's connected , digits , phd g: Connected . phd g: So there 's also the not just the prosody but the cross the cross - word modeling is probably quite different . phd d: H How grad f: But in TI - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that , phd g: Right . phd d: do we do on TI - digits ? grad f: so it 's gonna be different . grad f: One and a half percent , two percent , something like that ? professor c: I th no I think we got under a percent , but it was but it 's but  . The very best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at at Bell Labs , or . It s strikes me that there are more each of them is more informative because it 's so , random , grad f: OK . professor c: But I think a lot of systems sort of get half a percent , or three - quarters a percent , grad f: Right . grad f: But that  it 's really it 's it 's close - talking mikes , no noise , clean signal , just digits , every everything is good . phd g: It 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life , phd d: Pre - prehistory . grad f: OK , so , what I 'll do then is I 'll go ahead and enter , this data . And then , hand off to Jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits . One question I have that that  , we wouldn't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but I was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti  , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on . The only thing is I 'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena , in w i i The reason for doing it is because the the argument is that certainly with conversational speech , the stuff that we 've looked at here before , just doing the simple mapping , from , the phone , to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book , isn't right . In fact there 's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some , you know , some nasality is comes in here , and so forth . But , It could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's it 's for such a limited set , that maybe maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much . Di - an anybody ? Do you have any ? Anybody have any opinion about that , postdoc b: and that people might articulate more , and you that might end up with more a closer correspondence . phd d: Sort of less predictability , grad f: That it 's just postdoc b:   phd d: and You hafta grad f: It 's a Well Would , this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ? phd g: Well it 's definitely true that , when people are , reading , even if they 're re - reading what , they had said spontaneously , that they have very different patterns . phd g: So the fact that they 're reading , first of all , whether they 're reading in a room of , people , or rea you know , just the fact that they 're reading will make a difference . So , may maybe the thing will be do to take some very small subset ,  not have a big , program , but take a small set , subset of the conversational speech and a small subset of the digits , and look and and just get a feeling for it . postdoc b: H That could could be an interesting design , too , cuz then you 'd have the com the comparison of the , predictable speech versus the less predictable speech professor c: Cuz I don't think anybody is , I at least , I don't know , of anybody , well , I don't know , the answers . postdoc b: and maybe you 'd find that it worked in , in the , case of the pr of the , non - predictable . phd d: Hafta think about , the particular acoustic features to mark , too , because , some things , they wouldn't be able to mark , like , you know , tense lax . grad f: M I think we can get Ohala in to , give us some advice on that . postdoc b: Also I thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features , that professor c: Yeah , but I I I I was , like he said , I was gonna bring John in and ask John what he thought . It should be such that if you , if you , if you had o  , all of the features , determined that you that you were  ch have chosen , that that would tell you , in the steady - state case , the phone . grad f: Even , I guess with vowels that would be pretty hard , wouldn't it ? To identify actually , you know , which one it is ? postdoc b: It would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m more , g  ,  that 's I think about articulatory features , I think about , points of articulation , which means , rather than vowels . phd d: Points of articulation ? What do you mean ? postdoc b: So , is it , bilabial or dental or is it , you know , palatal . phd g: Well it 's also , there 's , really a difference between , the pronunciation models in the dictionary , and , the pronunciations that people produce . And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling professor c: Right . That maybe , although I think the meeting context is great , that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence . And you can go from not from that to the articulatory features , but that would be a better starting point for marking , the gestural features , then , data where you don't have that , because , we you wanna know , both about the way that they 're producing a certain sound , and what kinds of , you know what kinds of , phonemic , differences you get between these , transcribed , sequences and the dictionary ones . professor c: Well you might be right that mi might be the way at getting at , what I was talking about , but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I remember , when that happened , and , John Ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones . One you know , one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something , like , \" gonna see you tomorrow \" , grad f: And Or \" gonta \" . phd g: it could be \" going to \" or \" gonna \" or \" gonta s \" you know . And , that it would be nice to have these , intermediate , or these some these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well . phd g: Because , it 's not , that easy to go from the , dictionary , word pronuncia the dictionary phone pronunciation , to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of , representation . grad f: Well I don't think Morgan 's suggesting that we do that , though . professor c: Yeah , I I I 'm jus at the moment of course we 're just talking about what , to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it . So for instance , you might have someone who just has a wor has words with states , and has   , comes from articulatory gestures to that . But  , grad f: But What I 'm imagining is a score - like notation , where each line is a particular feature . grad f: so you would say , you know , it 's voiced through here , and so you have label here , and you have nas nasal here , and , they they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones . professor c:  this is the kind of reason why I remember when at one of the Switchboard , workshops , that  when we talked about doing the transcription project , Dave Talkin said , \" can't be done \" . professor c: He was he was , what what he meant was that this isn't , you know , a sequence of phones , and when you actually look at Switchboard that 's , not what you see , and , you know . It , grad f: And in in fact the inter - annotator agreement was not that good , right ? On the harder ones ? professor c: yeah  it was phd g: It depends how you look at it , and I I understand what you 're saying about this , kind of transcription exactly , professor c: Yeah . phd g: because I 've seen you know , where does the voicing bar start and so forth . phd g: All I 'm saying is that , it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said , and which syllables were reduced .  , if you 're gonna add the features it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries don't give you professor c:   phd g: because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion . phd d: So it would be it would be great if we had , either these kind of , labelings on , the same portion of Switchboard that Steve marked , or , Steve 's type markings on this data , with these . phd g: And Steve 's type is fairly it 's not that slow , I dunno exactly what the , timing was , but . professor c: Yeah u I don't disagree with it the on the only thing is that , What you actually will end en end up with is something , i it 's all compromised , right , so , the string that you end up with isn't , actually , what happened . But it 's it 's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened . And it 's more accurate than the than the dictionary or , if you 've got a pronunciation  lexicon that has three or four , grad f: The word . professor c: this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever , phd d: So it 's like a continuum . phd g: an and in some places it would fill in , So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere . phd g: So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram , phd d:   phd g: but you know what phone it was and that 's about all you can all you can say . phd g: And then there are other cases where , nasality , voicing phd d: It 's basically just having , multiple levels of of , information and marking , on the signal . grad f: Well the other difference is that the the features , are not synchronous , phd g: Right . phd g: Th - there 'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features . grad f: Well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system , that the states were features , rather than phones . phd g: And i if you 're Well , we we 've probably have a separate , discussion of ,  of whether you can do that . postdoc b: That 's Well , isn't that I thought that was , well but that wasn't that kinda the direction ? grad f: Yeah . postdoc b: I thought professor c: Yeah , so  , what , what where this is , I I want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind , so it should be something broader . But , The but  where I 'm coming from is , we 're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with , John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which , they , have , a m a multi - band system that is , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM , to  , estimate , the , value for m for for a particular feature . And this is part of a larger , image that John Dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this . And the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone and and , you know . But that that 's sort of what I was imagining doing , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not .  , but , Again , I wouldn't wanna , wouldn't want what we we produced to be so , know , local in perspective that it it was matched , what we were thinking of doing one week , And and , and , you know , what you 're saying is absolutely right . That , that if we , can we should put in , another level of , of description there if we 're gonna get into some of this low - level stuff . phd d: Well , you know ,   if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , You know , you The the question is , do they do that on , meeting data ? Or do they do that on , Switchboard ? grad f: That 's what I was saying , postdoc b: W Well it seems like you could do both . postdoc b: I was thinking that it would be interesting , to do it with respect to , parts of Switchboard anyway , in terms of , professor c:   postdoc b:  partly to see , if you could , generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be , based on the phone representation at that lower level . phd d: Well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on Switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions . phd d: You 'd have it , from the lowest level , the ac acoustic features , then you 'd have the , you know , the phonetic level that Steve did , postdoc b:   phd g: it is telephone band , so , the bandwidth might be phd d: It 'd be a complete , set then . So  i we 'll see wha how much we can , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing , phd g: Yeah . phd d: But it it might be good to do what Jane was saying  , you know , seed it , with , guesses about what we think the features are , based on , you know , the phone or Steve 's transcriptions or something . grad f: Alright , so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous , but then you could imagine , nudging them here and there . professor c: Well I think what  I 'm I 'm a l little behind in what they 're doing , now , and , the stuff they 're doing on Switchboard now . But I think that , Steve and the gang are doing , something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment . So  that 's probably the right way to go anyway , is to is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that , that , you know , tries , to label it all . postdoc b: So in in our case you 'd think about us s starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry , and then ? Or would we professor c: Well , regular dictionary , this is a pretty rich dictionary . It 's got , got a fair number of pronunciations in it postdoc b: But phd d: Or you could start from the if we were gonna , do the same set , of sentences that Steve had , done , we could start with those transcriptions . phd g: the problem is when you run , if you run a regular dictionary , even if you have variants , in there , which most people don't , you don't always get , out , the actual pronunciations , phd d: Yeah . phd g: so that 's why the human transcriber 's giving you the that pronunciation , postdoc b: Yeah . phd g: and so y they they I thought that they were professor c: Is that what they 're doing ? grad f: They are . professor c: Yeah , so I think that i i we also don't have , we 've got a good start on it , but we don't have a really good , meeting , recorder or recognizer or transcriber or anything yet , so . So ,  another way to look at this is to , is to , do some stuff on Switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it . professor c: And then , As we get , further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time , we can , do some of the same things to the meeting data . postdoc b: And I 'm and these people might they they are , s most of them are trained with IPA . professor c: Yeah postdoc b: They 'd be able to do phonetic - level coding , or articulatory . phd d: Are they busy for the next couple years , or ? postdoc b: Well , you know ,  they , they they 're interested in continuing working with us , so  I , and this would be up their alley , so , we could when the when you d meet with , with John Ohala and find , you know what taxonomy you want to apply , then , they 'd be , good to train onto it . phd g: It might be grad f:  you 'd you 'd want models for spreading . phd g: I was thinking it might be n phd d: Of the f acoustic features ? grad f: Yeah . phd g: Well it might be neat to do some , phonetic , features on these , nonword words . Are are these kinds of words that people never the \" huh \"s and the \"  \"s and the \" huh \" and the  These k No , I 'm serious . phd g: And some of them are , yeah , \"  - huh \"s , and \"  \"s , and , \"  ! \" \"  \" \" OK \" , \"  \" Grunts , that might be interesting . professor c: new version of , presegmentation ? phd a: oh yeah , I worked a little bit on the on the presegmentation to to get another version which does channel - specific , speech - nonspeech detection . And , what I did is I used some normalized features which , look in into the which is normalized energy , energy normalized by the mean over the channels and by the , minimum over the , other . And to to , to , yeah , to normalize also loudness and and modified loudness and things and that those special features actually are in my feature vector . phd a: And , and , therefore to be able to , somewhat distinguish between foreground and background speech in in the different in each channel . And , eh , I tested it on on three or four meetings and it seems to work , well yeah , fairly well , I I would say . grad f: So I I understand that 's what you were saying about your problem with , minimum . phd a: Yeah yeah , then I I did some some some things like that , postdoc b: Interesting . phd a: as there there are some some problems in , when , in the channel , there they the the speaker doesn't doesn't talk much or doesn't talk at all . Then , the , yeah , there are there are some problems with with with n with normalization , and , then , there the system doesn't work at all . So , I 'm I 'm glad that there is the the digit part , where everybody is forced to say something , professor c: Right . And , the thing is I I , then the evaluation of of the system is a little bit hard , as I don't have any references . phd a: Yeah , that 's the one one wh where I do the training on so I can't do the evaluation on So the thing is , can the transcribers perhaps do some , some some meetings in in terms of speech - nonspeech in in the specific channels ? grad f:  . postdoc b: Well , I have phd d: Well won't you have that from their transcriptions ? postdoc b: Well , OK , so , now we need grad f: No , cuz we need is really tight . postdoc b: so , I think I might have done what you 're requesting , though I did it in the service of a different thing . postdoc b: I have thirty minutes that I 've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels . postdoc b: And I could And And grad f: Hopefully that 's not the same meeting that we did . postdoc b: So , e so the , you know , we have the , th they transcribe as if it 's one channel with these with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts . postdoc b: And then we run it through then it then I 'm gonna edit it and I 'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart 's form format . postdoc b: And then you have , all these things split across according to channel , and then that means that , if a person contributed more than once in a given , overlap during that time bend that that two parts of the utterance end up together , it 's the same channel , phd a: OK . postdoc b: and then I took his tool , and last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts , I , tightened up the , boundaries on individual speakers ' channels , phd a: OK . postdoc b: cuz his his interface allows me to have total flexibility in the time tags across the channels . phd a: so , yeah yeah , that that that 's great , but what would be nice to have some more meetings , not just one meeting to to be sure that that , there is a system , phd d: So , current This week . grad f: Yeah , so if we could get a couple meetings done with that level of precision I think that would be a good idea .  , how how m much time so the meetings vary in length , what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you 'd like to have as your as your training set ? phd a: It seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes from from different meetings , so . postdoc b: OK , now you 're saying different meetings because of different speakers or because of different audio quality or both or ? phd a: Both both . professor c: Yeah , we don't have that much variety in meetings yet ,  we have this meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have  , couple examples of . grad e: Even probably with the gains differently will affect it , you mean phd a: not really as professor c: Poten - potentially . phd g: We can try running we haven't done this yet because , Andreas an is is gonna move over the SRI recognizer . phd g: cuz we 're running the evals and I just don't have machine time there . But , once that 's moved over , hopefully in a a couple days , then , we can take , what Jane just told us about as , the presegmented , the the segmentations that you did , at level eight or som at some , threshold that Jane , tha right , and try doing , forced alignment . phd g: And if it 's good , then that will that may give you a good boundary . Of course if it 's good , we don't then we 're we 're fine , phd a: Yeah . M phd g: but , I don't know yet whether these , segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words , will work or not . phd a: I I would quite like to have some manually transcribed references for for the system , as I 'm not sure if if it 's really good to compare with with some other automatic , found boundaries . postdoc b: Well , no , if we were to start with this and then tweak it h manually , would that that would be OK ? phd a: Yeah . phd g: but , I would have maybe a transciber , look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those . phd g: If they 're horrible it won't help at all , but they might not be horrible . postdoc b: How many minutes would you want from  , we could easily , get a section , you know , like say a minute or so , from every meeting that we have so f from the newer ones that we 're working on , everyone that we have . phd a: If it 's not the first minute of of the meeting , that that 's OK with me , but , in in the first minute , Often there are some some strange things going on which which aren't really , well , for , which which aren't re re really good . What what I 'd quite like , perhaps , is , to have , some five minutes of of of different meetings , so . postdoc b: And , then I wanted to ask you just for my inter information , then , would you , be trai cuz I don't quite unders so , would you be training then , the segmenter so that , it could , on the basis of that , segment the rest of the meeting ? So , if I give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to , to , providing tighter time bands ? phd a: I I could do a a retraining with that , yeah . phd a: That 's but but I hope that I I don't need to do it . phd a: I 'm I 'm not sure , but , for for for those three meetings whi which I which I did , it seems to be , quite well , but , there are some some as I said some problems with the lapel mike , but , perhaps we can do something with with cross - correlations to , to get rid of the of those . Well well what I want to do is to to look into cross - correlations for for removing those , false overlaps . phd g: Are the , wireless , different than the wired , mikes , at all ?  , have you noticed any difference ? phd a: I 'm I 'm not sure , if if there are any wired mikes in those meetings , or , I have have to loo have a look at them but , I 'm I 'm I think there 's no difference between , phd g: So it 's just the lapel versus everything else ? phd a: Yeah . postdoc b: OK , so then , if that 's five minutes per meeting we 've got like twelve minutes , twelve meetings , roughly , that I 'm that I 've been working with , then professor c: Of of of the meetings that you 're working with , how many of them are different , tha phd a: No . professor c: are there any of them that are different than , these two meetings ? postdoc b: Well oh wa in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the ? professor c: Yeah , speakers . postdoc b: just from what I 've seen , there are some where , you 're present or not present , and , then then you have the difference between the networks group and this group phd a: Yeah , I know , some of the NSA meetings , yeah . professor c: Do you have any of Jerry 's meetings in your , pack , er , postdoc b: no . professor c: No ? postdoc b: We could ,  you you recorded one last week or so . professor c: and and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that I think . postdoc b: OK , so if I , OK , included include , OK , then , if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour and I could get the transcribers to do that right  , what  is , that would be an hour sampled , and then they 'd transcribe those that hour , right ? That 's what I should do ? professor c: Yeah . So they get it into the multi - channel format and then adjust the timebands so it 's precise . professor c: So that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing , postdoc b: Absolutely . postdoc b: Oh gosh , well , last night , I did about half an hour in , three hours , which is not , terrific , professor c: Yeah . postdoc b: but , anyway , it 's an hour and a half per professor c: Yeah . phd a: Do the transcribers actually start wi with , transcribing new meetings , or are they ? postdoc b: Well ,  they 're still working they still have enough to finish that I haven't assigned a new meeting , phd a: OK . postdoc b: but the next , m m I was about to need to assign a new meeting and I was going to take it from one of the new ones , phd a: OK . phd g: So they 're really running out of , data , prett  that 's good . professor c: They 're running out of data unless we s make the decision that we should go over and start , transcribing the other set . postdoc b: And so I was in the process of like editing them but this is wonderful news . postdoc b: We funded the experiment with ,  also we were thinking maybe applying that that to getting the , Yeah , that 'll be , very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through . So , Liz , and and Don , and I met this morning , in the BARCO room , with the lecture hall , professor c: OK . postdoc b: and this afternoon , it drifted into the afternoon , concerning this issue of , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the SRI recognizer . And , well , so , I mentioned the process that I 'm going through with the data , so , you know , I get the data back from the transcri Well , s  , metaphorically , get the data back from the transcriber , and then I , check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that . And , I 'm going to be doing a more thorough editing , with respect to consistency of the conventions . And , then , I run it through , the channelize program to get it into the multi - channel format , OK . And the , what we discussed this morning , I would summarize as saying that , these units that result , in a a particular channel and a particular timeband , at at that level , vary in length . But it 's really an empirical question , whether the units we get at this point through , just that process I described might be sufficient for them . So , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gonna do , is , I 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after I 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . And I can do that , pretty quickly , with just , that minimal editing , without having to hand - break things . postdoc b: And then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , with the at that level , are sufficient . And if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece - wise , maybe it won't be the whole thing . So , that 's that 's what we were discussing , this morning as far as I Among phd g: Right . postdoc b: also we discussed some adaptational things , phd g: Then lots of postdoc b: so it 's like , phd g: Right . postdoc b:  You know I hadn't , incorporated , a convention explicitly to handle acronyms , for example , but if someone says , PZM it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from , the transcript what they said , professor c:   It 's like y it 's and so , I 've I 've incorporated also convention , with that but that 's easy to handle at the post editing phase , and I 'll mention it to , transcribers for the next phase but that 's OK .  , and also I 'll be , encoding , as I do my post - editing , the , things that are in curly brackets , which are clarificational material . So , it 's gonna be either a gloss or it 's gonna be a vocal sound like a , laugh or a cough , or , so forth . Or a non - vocal sound like a doors door - slam , and that can be easily done with a , you know , just a one little additional thing in the , in the general format . phd g: Yeah we j we just needed a way to , strip , you know , all the comments , all the things th the that linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with .  , but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models , or , you know , mouth noise , or , cough . And then there 's this interesting issue Jane brought up which I hadn't thought about before but I was , realizing as I went through the transcripts , that there are some noises like , well the good example was an inbreath , where a transcriber working from , the mixed , signal , doesn't know whose breath it is , grad f: Right . phd g: and they 've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct . And what we do is , if it 's a breath sound , you know , a sound from the speaker , we map it , to , a noise model , like a mouth - noise model in the recognizer , and , yeah , it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these , but , if they 're in the wrong channel , that 's , not a good idea . And then there 's also , things like door - slams that 's really in no one 's channel , they 're like it 's in the room . phd g: And  , Jane had this nice , idea of having , like an extra ,  couple tiers , grad f: An extra channel . So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel because maybe it was someone else 's breath , or  , so I think that 's a good you can always clean that up , post - processing . phd g: So a lot of little details , but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that . So the idea is then , Don can take , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer and we can , can run these . So when that 's , ready you know , as soon as that 's ready , and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get , twelve hours of force - aligned and recognized data . And , you know , start , working on it , postdoc b: And phd g: so we 're , I dunno a coup a week or two away I would say from , if if that process is automatic once we get your post - process , transcript . I 'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way , will be sufficient cuz I would save a lot of , time , dividing things . Just from I dunno how long were you did one ? grad e: I saw a couple , around twenty seconds , and that was just without looking too hard for it , so , I would imagine that there might be some that are longer . postdoc b: Well n One question , e w would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping ? grad e: No . No , but if we 're gonna segment it , like if there 's one speaker in there , that says \" OK \" or something , right in the middle , it 's gonna have a lot of dead time around it , phd g: Right . It 's not the it 's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment , it 's the fact that , there 's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place grad e: so it 's not postdoc b: Yeah . phd g: You know , if if someone has a very short utterance there , and that 's where , we , might wanna have this individual , you know , ha have your pre pre - process input . phd a: I I I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the those mult multi - channel , speech - nonspeech detections , if they would like to . phd g: So that 's probably what will happen , but we 'll try it this way and see . We 'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross - talk , and , noises and things . postdoc b: Oh I wanted to ask one thing , the microphones the new microphones , professor c: Yeah ? K . postdoc b: when do we get ,  ? grad f: they said it would take about a week . phd g: So what happens to our old microphones ? professor c: They go where old microphones go . grad f:  phd g: Do we give them to someone , or ? grad f: Well the only thing we 're gonna have extra , for now , phd g: We don't have more receivers , we just have grad f: Right , we don so the only thing we 'll have extra now is just the lapel . Since , what I decided to do , on Morgan 's suggestion , was just get two , new microphones , and try them out . grad f: Since they 're they 're like two hundred bucks a piece , we won't , at least try them out . phd d: So it 's a replacement for this headset mike ? grad f: Yep . phd d: What 's the , style of the headset ? grad f: It 's , it 's by Crown , and it 's one of these sort of mount around the ear thingies , and , when I s when I mentioned that we thought it was uncomfortable he said it was a common problem with the Sony . grad f: And I checked on the web , and every site I went to , raved about this particular mike . It 's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well , so we 'll see if it 's any good . postdoc b: You said it was used by aerobics instructors ? grad f:  Yep . professor c: For the recor for the record Adam is not a paid employee or a consultant of Crown . professor c: I said \" For the record Adam is is not a paid consultant or employee of Crown \" . grad f: The P Z Ms are Crown , aren't they ? professor c: Yeah . professor c: So if we go to a workshop about all this this it 's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings . professor c: Oh , yeah , what Which 'll be the meeting about the meeting about the meeting . grad f: Cuz then it would be a meeting about the meeting about the meeting about meetings . phd a: S s grad f: Pause between the lines , remember ? grad e: Excuse me "

        "Query": "Summarize the financing, financial targets, aims, target markets, and cost constraints of the new remote control project.",
        "Summary": "The remote control design includes a double-curved plastic case in special colors, with buttons made of rubber or wood in various forms and colors. The remote does not have a clock. The cost of the remote is within budget, excluding the voice recognizer, with only 4.30 euros remaining. The price of the remote is set at 25 euros, with a production cost of 12.5 euros. The company aims to sell at least 2 million units to achieve a profit goal of 50 million euros. The target market for the remote is international, covering different users, cultures, and trends. The remote will primarily be marketed in Europe and North America, and at least 4 million units need to be sold to meet the profit goals.",
        "Article": "First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . user interface: project manager: So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did .  do you have a PowerPoint or no ? user interface: Yeah , it's in the should be in the m Project . marketing: Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or user interface: You know you could you could do it yourself actually .  well , the function of a remote control , as what  we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .  some of the considerations is just  for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like  we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . project manager: user interface: And we can decide if that's what we want ,  if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .  and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , project manager: user interface: and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze ,  slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . user interface: And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . user interface: And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete .  , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . Who would like to  follow that one up ? Now , that we've discussed marketing: I can go . marketing: Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us  if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really  there's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . So user interface: And that meaning what ? marketing: Like They like I guess use the buttons a lot . project manager: What do you mean by  the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . marketing: whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex project manager: Oh , right . marketing: and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , project manager:  . marketing: and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , user interface: S marketing: but  they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . project manager: user interface: Wait , is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? marketing: Sh project manager: Could be , yeah . industrial designer: Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? user interface: Like project manager: Oh . marketing:  yeah , that's what my web site said , I user interface: Channel , volume , power . user interface: It's like if you're holding it marketing: I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . marketing: But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . marketing: Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is .  the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . user interface: marketing: And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . project manager: And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? marketing: I guess so , yeah . marketing: Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . project manager: Didn't they  didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it user interface: It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'm just trying to move it .  I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . industrial designer:  okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . industrial designer: We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . user interface: marketing: What exactly is a smart chip ? industrial designer: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . user interface: Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? industrial designer: I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . user interface: industrial designer:  power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . user interface: industrial designer:  a large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . industrial designer: Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system .  smart chip that perverts  that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch .  extra bulb could just be for flashiness ,  subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device .  the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . marketing: So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? industrial designer: This is just like a rough schematic . project manager: So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? marketing: Oh okay . user interface: Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . project manager: The l the light up kind of industrial designer: Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , marketing: Like that we know the battery's working . industrial designer: 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? project manager:  . project manager: Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ? industrial designer: I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons . user interface: Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like  the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? marketing: I think we should . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , project manager:  . Okay , let's talk about all of our We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's  wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . project manager: in States we don't have it , but  it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , user interface: I know . marketing: What is it ? user interface: project manager: it's very  bland looking , it's just text on the screen , user interface: Yeah , project manager: not even user interface: it's like black , black and white kind of project manager: Yeah , just black with just text . industrial designer: You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so user interface: It'll give you the sports . marketing: Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? project manager: Kind of . project manager: So anyway user interface: You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , industrial designer: Seemingly . marketing: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? project manager: Right . project manager: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements . industrial designer: So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? project manager: Yes . project manager: What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about  the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So our target group is You mentioned  older people ? Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? user interface: project manager: Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically user interface: It's gonna make it nicer .  they want something user-friendly , so industrial designer:  well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so we want  for our target group would we say , young and old , all age ranges , all  , not kids obviously , right ? Or kids ? marketing: No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . project manager: Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range marketing: Yeah , I think we need it all . project manager:  what about technic technical  specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? industrial designer: marketing:  I would say we should say dumber than the average person . industrial designer: how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . And we wanna keep  I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . industrial designer: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? user interface: project manager: I think so . user interface: project manager: A finding kind of device or industrial designer: And marketing: I need we we need a like homing device . industrial designer: like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? user interface: Oh right yeah okay . industrial designer: What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . marketing: Do you think people'll really go for that though ? industrial designer: It's useful for the remote phone . project manager: Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? marketing: I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . user interface: Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . user interface: Well , then we could marketing: Do w user interface: If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled  demo demographic . marketing: Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge project manager: You could  we could hook it up . marketing: It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , project manager: Oh . marketing: They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and industrial designer: project manager: And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has user interface: Well marketing: just sitcoms and stuff . user interface: Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , marketing: So user interface: 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , project manager: Right . user interface: whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ? project manager:  . marketing: Wait , on the remote itself ? project manager: user interface: Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . user interface: Well , I don't know , if you can like well project manager: Unless you could say the channel . user interface: I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ? industrial designer: I think people would find that too foreign . project manager: And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . marketing: You definitely need project manager: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so project manager: 'Kay . user interface: And how do we marketing: I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . project manager: We could just have the logo in yellow , user interface: Can't make it entirely project manager: or maybe a yellow light for the keys . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . So we've simplified , we don't need all those  play , fast-forward , rewind , user interface: Right , yeah . project manager: So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down ,  the numbers Yeah . project manager:  can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those user interface: Two examples . project manager: Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? user interface: Oh , it's a Yeah . marketing: Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? project manager: The T_V_ .  how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? user interface: Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . user interface: and so it's like marketing: Yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . project manager: Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , user interface: I don't well , I don't know . user interface: Well , that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . marketing: Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . project manager: That one ? user interface: So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , project manager: Right . user interface: including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now project manager: In the middle perhaps . Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? industrial designer: I had something , but I forgot . After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail .  I'm gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept ,  U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? No ? Okay , well , this meeting is officially over "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussions and debates surrounding the government's response to Covid-19, including the delay, companies laying off workers, transparency of information, contact tracing apps, and eligibility for art funding.",
        "Summary": "The Prime Minister responded to the opposition party's concerns by highlighting the government's swift implementation of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and their support for small businesses through the Canada Emergency Business Account. However, the opposition party expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the government did not reach out to enough businesses. They also criticized the rigidity and difficulty of the rent relief program. The Prime Minister reiterated that the government's priority has always been to support workers in need and prevent job losses across all organizations and companies. The Minister of Canadian Heritage emphasized the government's commitment to transparency during the crisis, but the opposition party questioned the allocation of $35 billion in infrastructure funds, suspecting that it may have been used for personal salaries. The government assured that they have been actively exploring ways to enhance contact tracing capabilities in collaboration with provinces, territories, and volunteer organizations, while also addressing concerns raised by the Privacy Commissioner regarding privacy and ethical considerations. Additionally, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced a funding of $500 million to support Canada's arts, sports, and cultural sectors, with further details to be released in the coming days.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): We'll call this meeting to order. Welcome to the fifth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Pursuant to the order passed on Monday, April20, the committee is meeting today to consider ministerial announcements, to allow members of the committee to present petitions, and to question ministers, including the Prime Minister, about the COVID-19 pandemic. Tomorrow, May8, Dr.AndreaMcCrady, Dominion Carillonneur, will give a special recital to mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Victory in Europe Day, VE Day, commemorates the formal acceptance of Germany's surrender by allied forces at the end of the Second World War. While the pandemic prevents us from gathering to celebrate in person, tomorrow at noon the voice of our nation will ring out in remembrance of this milestone in our history. Just so you are aware, the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee. I would like to remind members that, as in the House of Commons or committee, they should not take photos of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of the interpreters and to allow the meeting to proceed smoothly, I would ask you to follow some instructions. When you are ready to speak, click on the microphone icon to activate your microphone, or hold the space bar down while you are speaking. If you release the bar, your microphone will revert to mute, just like a walkie-talkie. Honourable members, I would like to remind you that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should you need to request the floor outside of your designated speaking time, you should activate your mike and state that you have a point of order. If a member of the committee wishes to intervene on a point of order raised by another person, you should use the raised hand function to indicate to the chair that you wish to speak. Should any technical challenges arise, for example, in relation to interpretation, please advise the chair immediately by raising a point of order, and the technical team will work on resolving them. If you get accidentally disconnected, please try to rejoin the meeting with the information you used to join initially. Before we get started, please note that in the top right-hand corner of your screen is a button that you can use to change views. Speaker view allows you to focus on the person currently speaking; gallery view allows you to see a larger number of participants. You can click through the multiple pages in the gallery view to see who is on and how many more participants there are. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. In addition, to ensure a petition is considered properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for a petition certified in a previous Parliament should be mailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. Chair, five years ago when Parliament passed Bill C-14, then justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said that it represented a finely tuned balance between access and safeguards. Petitioners on the first petition I'm presenting are very concerned to see Bill C-7 before Parliament, which removes safeguards ahead of that five-year review. Petitioners specifically mention their concerns about the removal of the mandatory 10-day reflection period, which can already be waived in certain circumstances. They are concerned about reducing the number of witnesses required to oversee it and ensure that a request has been properly made. The second and final petition that I will be presenting today is with respect to Senate Bill S-204. This would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who did not consent. This responds specifically to concerns about organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China involving Falun Gong practitioners and increasing concerns that this is being or about to be applied to Uighurs as well. Petitioners are noting that in the previous Parliament there were bills on this, Bill C-350 and Bill S-240. Now, in this Parliament there is a bill, Bill S-204, and the petitioners hope that this 43rd Parliament will be the one that gets it passed. This is my first occasion to present a petition in our virtual format of the COVID-19 committee. The petition I am presenting today, which was previously approved, is from a number of constituents who are concerned that we pursue the Paris Agreement to hold the global average temperature increase to no more than 1.5C. The Paris Agreement itself embeds in it the concept of Just Transition with a capital J and a capital T, the concept of just transition ensuring fairness and support for all workers in the fossil fuel sector. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to move forward with an act to ensure just transition and to ensure adequate funding so that workers and communities dependent on the fossil fuel sector receive meaningful support to ensure security in their lives in the transition to more sustainable energy use. I want to thank the honourable members for their usual collaboration and now we'll go on to mr. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): On a point of order, Mr. Chair, on Tuesday, at our COVID-19 committee of the whole meeting, I was asking a question which started at 12:56:06 and was cut off at 1:00:32, so I still have 34 seconds of time remaining in my question time of five minutes. If you believe that my time was unjustly cut off and that it was unfair treatment of the official opposition when we were raising our points of order, I would ask that the 34 seconds be tacked on to the opening round for the opposition and credited to Rosemarie Falk, who will be leading off for the Conservatives. the chair: Normally what happens is the chair uses judgment, and with 35 seconds, there isn't enough time obviously for a full question or answer, most of the time. I want everyone to know that I do have a timer next to me and I am timing the questions, and I will be treating the answers the same way. We've taken a little bit of the chair's ability to give judgment on it, but it will be from now on. I would like to remind the honourable members that no member will be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. Will the Prime Minister stand up for Canada's energy workers, or does he agree with the fringe left and those who want to destroy our country? ms. Chair, I believe that the language that the honourable member just used is unparliamentary mr. It is unacceptable to assert that anyone who wants to make a point about our economy is trying to destroy the country. As I pointed out this morning in my press conference, we cannot move forward on a transformation of our energy sector without supporting the workers in that energy sector. We need their innovation and we need their hard work if we are going to lower our emissions, if we are going to reach our the chair: We'll go to Ms. Chair, it has been 43 days since the finance minister promised Canada's energy sector liquidity through the Business Development Bank of Canada. If the government doesn't step up to support our energy sector, they are in effect doubling down on their support for foreign, unethically sourced oil. Chair, when will the credit options be available to Canada's small and medium energy firms? the chair: I want to remind honourable members that we do have interpreters who are listening and translating. Chair, from the very beginning, our priority through this pandemic and this crisis has been to support workers across the country. We have sent billions of dollars to workers right across the country, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, B.C., and Newfoundland and Labrador in the energy sector for them to be able to support their families through this difficult time. The announcements to date fall well short of what is needed to maintain a steady supply of affordable and healthy food. Instead of responding to specific COVID-19 challenges, our farmers are facing the Liberals' reannounced $125 million that was already budgeted in the AgriRecovery program. Will the Prime Minister finally step up and take our food supply chain seriously, or is agriculture just an afterthought for him? right hon. Chair, we take agriculture and our agricultural sector extremely seriously, which is why we announced hundreds of millions of dollars a couple of days ago to respond to pressing needs. We will continue to make investments to ensure both the safety of workers in our agricultural sector and the safety of our communities, as well as the continued flow of high-quality Canadian food onto our tables right across the country. Our farmers are faced with rising operational costs, a disrupted service industry, labour shortages and a reduced capacity at processing plants. When will the Prime Minister deliver adequate support to address the critical changes facing our ag industry? right hon. Chair, I would suggest respectfully that the honourable member take a look once again at the announcement we made, which actually highlights significant new investments to support our agricultural industry. Every step of the way in this unprecedented situation, we've been moving forward on doing more, on adjusting and on investing more. We need to support our agricultural sector and the people who work so hard to put food on Canadians' tables right across the country and we will continue to. Chair, Canadians expect to find healthy and affordable food at their grocery stores, but if the government does not take action now, that's not a given. It is an enormous hit to their bottom line, and the recent carbon tax hike is taking even more money out of the pockets of farmers at a time when they can afford it the least. Will the Prime Minister exempt all farm operations from the carbon tax and reimburse the money that they have already taken from them? right hon. Chair, it's a shame to hear the member opposite accidentallyunintentionally, I'm certainmislead the House and Canadians. This is the way of creating a better future for our kids and grandkids, which I know people in communities right across the country, including our farm communities, want to see happen. We are moving forward in a responsible way to put a price on pollution and put more money in average Canadians' pockets. marilne gill (manicouagan, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I am thinking about the lobster fishery in the Magdalen Islands, the crab fishery on the Cte-Nord or those fishing for herring in the south of the Gasp. Because imports have ceased, because the domestic market is weak and in decline because of the interruption of the tourism and restaurant industries, the fishing industry and its fishers must be supported. justin trudeau: Our fishers do exceptional work that is extremely important in feeding Canadians and in contributing to our economic success through their exports around the world. I know about the processing industry and the $62.5million to be used essentially for freezing products, but I am talking about the fishers themselves. In addition, they feel that they will be losing money, because of the drop in the price of their resource. They are just as essential as farmers, but they are going to have to work at a loss and they are not going to have workers to assist them. Are you going to do anything else, in addition to the assistance of $62.5million? Time is of the essence. We recognize the challenges that fishers must face in terms of social distancing and of work that is often seasonal. We are going to continue working with the industry, with the fishers, and with the coastal communities in order to ensure that people have confidence in their abilities and in their future. In times of crisis, it is important for the government to be there to support people, and that is exactly what we are going to continue to do. But, given the cyclical nature of the industry, some sectors have had to postpone for several weeks the preparations they need for fishing activities. The current program could be modified in a number of ways, to accommodate the cycle, the dates, and the size of the companies. They would really like to take advantage of the $40,000loan, but they cannot because of their payroll. I can already suggest a number of solutions to the government and to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, that would bring help to those businesses very quickly. The fishers carry on, because it is a duty for them, because they want to help us and to be part of the effort at this time of crisis. I would really like to hear a guarantee that they will be supported, that they will be able to put food on the table this year, and that they will be able to support the communities that often depend on the fishing industry, a major industry in those communities. justin trudeau: Minister Jordan has been working with the fishers, the fishing industry and the communities affected by the crisis since the crisis began. From the outset, our priority has been to support the millions of Canadians from coast to coast who have lost their jobs. We have been able to do so, but we are going to continue to work for those who must now face difficulties. the chair: Before we move to the next question, I would like to remind members of the committee to speak slowly, and to address their remarks to the chair and not directly to each other. They've seen revenues plummet, and at the same time the cost of delivering municipal services has risen. As the Prime Minister knows, municipalities are unable to run deficits and so they are facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that Canadians depend on. They're going to be even more important during the recovery, especially when it comes to delivering on the infrastructure programs before us. My question for the Prime Minister is, when can they expect federal financial support to arrive? right hon. Chair, no government in Canada's history has done more to work with our municipalities, with our cities, with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to respond to the challenges they're facing and to partner with them. Things from infrastructure to investments have made a huge difference right across the country in the quality of life of Canadians in towns, large and small, from coast to coast to coast. As I'm sure the member well knows, our Constitution requires that most of the funding for municipalities flow through the provinces. We are working with the provinces, as we continue to work with the cities, to ensure that we're able to support this order of government that delivers the vast majority of services to Canadians with very little financial means. Chair, it would seem that the federal government has the fiscal capacity and the responsibility to help municipalities weather this crisis. Transit systems have been hit particularly hard and have seen the bulk of the layoffs in the municipal sector. These transit services carry essential workers to work, whether they are health care workers, grocery store workers, janitors or others. We will see service cutbacks precisely at a time when we want to be expanding transit and improving transit in our communities. Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that the federal government needs to step in to safeguard and protect Canada's transit services? right hon. Chair, this federal government recognizes how important it is to support all Canadians, which is why we put forward unprecedented measures to help millions upon millions of Canadians with the CERB and with the wage subsidy. I'll be having a conversation with all other first ministers tonight to talk about a broad range of issues. We have continued to engage with them, but again, it is important to respect the Constitution and understand that funding for municipalities and cities does go through the provinces. The federal government is happy to be there to support, but it must be the chair: We will go to Mr. Chair, I am wondering how the Prime Minister could explain to a bus driver in Vancouver who has been laid off that as a public sector worker, she can't access the federal wage subsidy, while an equivalent worker in the airline industry gets to keep her job with the federal help of that program. Chair, I'm happy to explain to the member and to all Canadians that our Constitution creates federal areas of jurisdiction and provincial areas of jurisdiction. The airline industry, like banking, like telecommunications, is a federal area of jurisdiction that we have been able to move forward on. More than that, we brought the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy to all industries across this country, because we knew that as the federal government, it was something that we needed to step up on the chair: We will go back to Mr. Faced with minimal health care capacity, remote indigenous communities in my riding are taking matters into their own hands. The Nuxalk have put up a checkpoint on Highway 20 to protect community members and prevent non-essential travel. In particular, it is to protect the three remaining fluent speakers of the Nuxalk language, these cherished elders in their community. The Haida on Haida Gwaii have set up a similar checkpoint, as have communities throughout British Columbia, yet federal support for indigenous communities amounts to only $39 million for all of the indigenous communities in B.C. Does the Prime Minister not agree that more support is warranted to help indigenous communities in my riding and across the country? right hon. Chair, from the very beginning, we made funds available to Canadians right across the country, particularly people in indigenous remote or northern communities who we knew would be facing more difficult challenges because of the existing vulnerabilities in their health care system and socio-economic circumstances. We have made unprecedented investments and we will continue to make the necessary investments, because we need to make sure that indigenous Canadians, and indeed all Canadians, have the supports they need to make it through this crisis. luc berthold (mganticl'rable, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr.Chair. I am going to keep talking about the area of jurisdiction that the Prime Minister likes to talk about, except that I want to point out the incompetence of the Liberals in keeping their commitments on infrastructure projects. As the provinces gradually restart their economies, can the Prime Minister tell us how many projects that the provinces have submitted are waiting for approval from his government? mr. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, I hope that the length of the pause will not be taken out of my time. catherine mckenna (minister of infrastructure and communities): I'm sorry, Mr.Chair, I was on mute. It is very important to build projects that will create good jobs the chair: We are returning to Mr.Berthold. How many projects are currently awaiting government approval? I know that the minister has been meeting virtually with the provinces over the last few days. Rather than wait for the right political opportunity to approve these files, will the minister commit today to respecting the provinces and approving by next week all the projects that are sitting on her desk? hon. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, I'm pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories. We will announce the approval of projects because it's very important for our economy, our communities and creating good jobs. luc berthold: Does the minister understand that she hasn't told us how many projects are still pending? The construction season is very short. Approval of a project in July means that work can't begin until next year, which won't help revive our economy. catherine mckenna: I want to make it clear that we have approved hundreds of projects in the last few weeks. These projects are important for the economy and the environment, as well as for jobs the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, while the minister is calling for a green recovery of the country's economy, public transit is at risk. The Union des municipalits du Qubec estimates that the monthly losses are between $75million and $100million. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, we recognize the importance of public transit for our economy, since some essential workers use public transit. As the Prime Minister said, it's the provinces that must help because the money the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, once again, what we're hearing is that the government is passing the buck to the provinces. Unfortunately, the minister was unable to answer a single question about the number of infrastructure projects still on the federal government's desk, which is very important. In terms of the number of projects that we've approved, I would be happy to inform the hon. member of the exact number of all the approved projects that my department has been working very hard on over the past few months to approve projects to go forward. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, do I have any time left? the chair: No, your time is up. On March 28, the minister personally tweeted out a thank you to the People's Republic of China for donating PPE to Canada. More recently, Taiwan donated half a million surgical masks to Canada, yet here we are, two weeks later, and the minister has yet to personally thank Taiwan for its generosity. I can say, after my COVID foreign ministers call, that the world community has come together to make sure that supply chains will remain intact and that we will have transit hubs and air bridges. Chair, I didn't hear a thank you there, so I'm going to try again. On May 4, the Government of Taiwan delivered 25,000 surgical masks to the Government of British Columbia. Minister of Citizens' Services Anne Kang and Minister of State for Child Care Katrina Chen, who, as ministers, officially thanked the Government of Taiwan for its donation. Again, will the minister now do the right thing and, on behalf of Canadians, recognize the generosity of Taiwan and thank its government for that timely donation? hon. Chair, as I said to you before, Canada is grateful to all who have given supplies to Canada. As I said, when it comes to global health, when it comes to helping each other, I think it is a duty for all to come together. We are grateful and thankful for all those who have agreed to help Canada and Canadians from coast to coast to coast in times of need. I've repeated that and have said many times in many forums that we are grateful and thankful to all of those who are helping Canada. The Government of Taiwan has been the world leader in successfully fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, the People's Republic of China continues to oppose Taiwan's membership in the World Health Organization. Will the minister now do the right thing and assure Canadians that he will fully support efforts to grant Taiwan membership in the World Health Organization? hon. That said, we support Taiwan to continue meaningful participation in international multilateral forums, particularly when it comes to health. We also believe that Taiwan's role as an observer in the World Health Assembly meeting is of interest to the international health community and we have been supportive of that. Can he tell us exactly how many Canadians remain abroad who have expressed a desire to be repatriated? hon. As of today, we have repatriated more than 20,000 Canadians on 232 flights from 87 countries. As the Prime Minister and I have said from the beginning, we will make our best effort to repatriate everyone who wants to come back home during the crisis. My office has received correspondence from Canadians concerned that trial delays due to COVID-19 may result in criminals walking free. As this government has been working overtime to criminalize law-abiding citizens with new and useless gun laws, will the Minister of Justice ensure that real criminals will not walk free as a result of delays in the justice system? hon. We have been working with my provincial counterparts across Canada, as well as with the various federal courts and also, through my provincial counterparts, with the superior courts and courts of appeal across Canada. Each particular jurisdiction has taken measures to ensure that basic essential services within the court system are maintained, through a variety of means, and we believe that we will be able to solve these various challenges. Chair, the regional relief and recovery fund was announced weeks ago as a way to help small and medium-sized businesses in rural communities, like those in my riding. Can the minister clarify whether we are days away or weeks away from this support flowing to the businesses that need it so desperately? hon. Chair, I had the chance to talk with many of the chambers of commerce and business owners throughout Atlantic Canada, and we hear their anxiety. That's why ACOA's doing great work on the ground to make sure we can help them through this very difficult period. We have increased the budget of ACOAgood newsand I'll be coming up with the details very soon. It will be a pleasure to collaborate with him to make sure that we can help many businesses and business owners across the Atlantic region. In particular, they are unable to access the emergency business account, because they do not have a payroll. There are hundreds and thousands of small businesses in this very situation, vital small businesses in our communities, but they do not meet this requirement. What does the Minister of Finance have to say to these small businesses that are suffering right now? hon. I want all the businesses that he is talking about and all of them throughout the country to know that we continue to work very hard to make sure they're supported through this difficult period. We know that businesses are being supported through getting access to the wage subsidy to keep their employees together, and they're getting help, whether it's with rent or to defray costs by deferring GST and HST or customs duty payments. Some have a personal account that they've dealt with over the years rather than a business account, and that makes them ineligible. Chair, small businesses are concerned about their ability to survive, and no amount of deferrals, loans or subsidies can substitute for their need to be open and servicing their customers. Can the government confirm that a sectoral risk analysis has taken place to assist the provinces in reopening the economy? hon. Chair, I can assure the member that we've been very clear in terms of our strategy around reopening the economy. We need to make sure that we follow the advice of the experts and the health authorities to do so in a manner that does not compromise the health and well-being of Canadians. We of course will have a sectoral lens, and as you can see by some of the initiatives and the support packages we've put forward the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Can the government confirm that the programs currently in place will be expanded to these hard-working Canadians? hon. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we continue to work with all of our small businesses and I want to thank him for raising this very important issue. I want to assure our Canadian small businesses that we are going to continue to do this work to make sure they are supported. james cumming: Can the minister give me a date when she will be able to announce to these businesses that they will be eligible? hon. mary ng: I want to assure our Canadian small businesses of their importance and of the importance of their contributions to all of our communities. I want them to know that we continue to listen and that we will ensure that they are supported and continue to be supported during this difficult time. Can you give me a date when I can tell these thousands of businesses they will be supported if they pay dividends or if they use contractors within their businesses? hon. The landlord says that he doesn't have the 25% needed to be eligible for the program because he's already paying for common area costs and deferrals on utilities, which he will have to pay on his mortgage. Will the government reform the rent relief program to focus on tenants and not just the landlords? hon. Chair, I want to let the member know that we are working to make sure that the details of the emergency program for rent are out there so that both tenants and landlords can understand the situation. We're seeing a significant number of both landlords and tenants coming forward to register for this program, and we are convinced that it will be in the best interests of landlords to move forward and give tenants this relief. Chair, we've been hearing, however, from small business owners that their landlords don't find the government's rent relief program appealing enough. Can the government confirm, given the program's low eligibility rate, that the program will be expanded and be more efficient in helping tenants? hon. Chair, we recognize that it's critically important that all of the details of this program be out there for landlords and tenants to understand. This is a program that we've put out within the last week, and we are confident that it's in the best interests of tenants and landlords. One easy way to do that would be to expand the Canada summer jobs program to businesses with over 50 employees. Will the government consider doing so to allow students to gain that very valuable work experience over the coming months? hon. The second uptake provided employers across the country with the ability to add their needs for students to the mix. During this pandemic, the government has consistently called for a team Canada, non-partisan approach, and I was glad to hear that said a little earlier today. However, at the same time, the current government has used a parliamentary back door to launch a poorly thought out gun ban. We have a government that didn't win the popular vote, and I'm just wondering how I explain to my residents, because I'm getting so many calls, that this is not a bloated response because, quite frankly, it is. Chair, I think the honourable member can explain to his constituents that the forming of regulations through order in council is actually the process prescribed in law in Canada under section 117.15 of the Criminal Code. I would also invite the member to advise his constituents that way back in 1991, when there were some Conservatives who called themselves Progressive, the Mulroney government brought forward, in Bill C-17, the authority under that section for an order in council to prescribe specific makes, models and variants of military firearms as prohibited or restricted. terry dowdall: I'm not sure, but I'm hoping, that I'll get an honest answer on this question from the minister, who has everything from rocket launchers to basically toy guns on the ban list. When will we get the cost of this buyback program? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to please be careful in their language when they are referring to others. I won't comment on this one particularly, but I want all of you to be very, very careful when referring to other members. Chair, to respond to some of the obfuscations and deceptions that have been put out there. I think it's very clear, and I invite the member to look at the list of weapons that are the chair: We'll go back to Mr. bill blair: Actually, I'm very much looking forward to bringing forward legislation as soon as the House resumes. We will have a vigorous debate in Parliament about the form a buyback will take and we will bring forward a budget at that time. bill blair: If people are illegally in possession of the weapons and they're committing a crime, they will be dealt with for the crimes they commit. Canadians in my riding who suffer from cystic fibrosis are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. While these Canadians with existing lung conditions are incredibly worried about a virus that attacks the ability to breathe, the good news is that there are life-saving medicines for those with CF. I am wondering if and when the government will correct these guidelines and give access to life-saving medicines for our most vulnerable. Chair, as you know, the government has been very committed to improving access and affordability for prescription medications for all Canadians. The PMPRB regulatory amendments will help Canadians be able to afford their prescriptions, and Canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines. In fact, many countries with much lower medicine prices gained access to new medicines in the same time frame as Canada frame, or even faster, so we are excited to do this work. Chair, our seniors are being particularly hard hit right now during this pandemic, yet seniors have not been given any direct support. Funding to charities like the United Way is being labelled as support for seniors, but most won't see any of this support. Seniors in my riding have asked for an increase in their CPP and OAS, and to be able to make untaxed bulk withdrawals from their RRSPs while they still have some value. deb schulte (minister of seniors): I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. the chair: You might want to try your space bar and keep it down while you're speaking. I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. We've reduced the minimum RRIF withdrawal by 25%, and we've made the CERB available to working seniors who have lost their jobs due to the COVID pandemic. We know there's more work to do, and we'll have more to say in the future. the chair: I want to remind honourable members that if there are issues, we are taking note of them, and we'll hopefully resolve them by the next meeting. marie-hlne gaudreau (laurentideslabelle, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. In fact, we have been looking at a number of ways to support increased contact tracing across the country, including working with provinces and territories to boost their capacity through human resources and volunteer organizations. Anything we put forward as a digital tool to assist with contact tracing would be thoroughly considerate of Canadians' privacy rights. But you know as well as I do that the Privacy Commissioner has been calling us to task for a very long time now, because there is also a crisis of confidence. You know as well as I do that for 90%of Canadians, the misuse of their personal data is a cause for concern, whether it be for profiling or business development purposes. I'd like to know whether this commitment will be implemented quickly so that legislation can be passed on this issue, in this case the Privacy Act. We're talking about what is going on in Quebec, among other places, and I would like to make sure that the federal government commits to respecting the proposals regarding geolocation and contact tracing possibilities, with full respect for the right to privacy. We have worked very closely with provinces and territories for a long time before the outbreak, but certainly ever since the outbreak. We respect the rights of jurisdictional authorities to use tools that have been properly vetted through their own provincial and territorial legislation. marie-hlne gaudreau: Concerning privacy, there are 30million Quebeckers and Canadians who have had their personal data leaked. Why is it that our laws don't allow us to apply financial penalties so that we can then go further? The very basis is to be concerned about our fundamental rights. As the critic for access to information and privacy, I'd like a commitment that the federal government will deal not with what the provinces are doing, but with the Privacy Act. the chair: Your time is up, but I'll give the floor to the minister for 30seconds. Our government will ensure the privacy of Canadians is respected, support responsible innovation and take reasonable steps to strengthen enforcement powers. yvan baker (etobicoke centre, lib.): Thank you very much, Mr. Minister, in my riding of Etobicoke Centre, we are mourning the loss of 40 residents to COVID-19 at the Eatonville long-term care centre. Of all Canadians who have died from COVID-19, 79% were living in long-term care homes. I understand that long-term care homes fall within the jurisdiction of provincial governments in Canada, but this is a crisis. What is the federal government doing right now to help protect our seniors who are living in long-term care homes from COVID-19? What will we do to reform our long-term care homes in the future to ensure that our seniors in Etobicoke Centre and across Canada get the care they deserve? hon. We are deeply concerned by the outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities, and our thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one. As my colleague mentioned, while these facilities are regulated by provinces and territories, we have been focused on protecting the health and safety of long-term care residents and staff while working with our partners in a team Canada approach. We're working with the provinces and territories to cost-share a temporary salary top-up for long-term care workers. We are working through investing $2 billion to secure personal protective equipment for the health of workers, including those in the long-term care homes, and we've deployed the Canadian Armed Forces to assist 25 long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario. We all have a role to play to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect our seniors and caregivers. At the finance committee, we've heard a lot of concerns from all sectors of the economy as a result of COVID-19 and we've been presented with quite a number of possible solutions as well, several of which the government has acted upon. It is very welcome support, but I sincerely believe the farm sector will be taking the Prime Minister up on the suggestion that $250 million should be seen as an initial investment. However, as a result of reduced processor contracts for next year, plus cancelled seed contracts, millions of dollars of seed and process potatoes have no home. How does the minister see Tuesday's announcement addressing potato farmers' concerns? Second, in 2013, long-term financial safety nets were gutted by the Harper government. We know the importance of our potato farmers, and that's why we are launching a first-ever surplus food purchase program, a $50-million fund designed to help redistribute existing inventories, such as potatoes, to local food organizations. On the financial safety net that we have in place for our farmers, called the business risk management program, we announced up to $125 million in funding through AgriRecovery and made changes to AgriStability that will help producers quickly. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that BRM programs, including AgriInvest, are there to help farmers in difficult times. Robyn, who has owned Arbutus Health in Tofino for over 13 years, can't apply for the Canada emergency business account loan, simply because she doesn't have a payroll of over $20,000. With no business income and without emergency financing, it is virtually impossible for her to pay her bills or come up with the 25% needed for the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program. The government promised to be flexible and willing to adjust its COVID response rollout so that nobody falls through the cracks, but Robyn, like tens of thousands of proprietors who are the economic job creators of our communities, urgently needs the government's help now. Will the government amend its programs to help more business owners so that people like Robyn don't lose their businesses? hon. I know he and I have talked about this, and I appreciate the input and the feedback that he is providing from business directly. I want to assure Robyn and her businesses, and many businesses across the country, that we are absolutely listening, and we will continue to make sure we are supporting those businesses during this period. We also know that more has to be done, and we will continue to work with you and businesses across the country so that we can indeed give them that necessary support to weather this difficult period of COVID-19. I was talking to Heather last night, who also owns a business in Tofino, Basic Goodness Pizzeria, with her partner Marco. Like many proprietors of family businesses who aren't on payroll, they don't qualify for the business loans. Now with the new rollout of the rent support, they're not sure if their landlord is willing to play ball and even apply. Heather was in tears last night as she told me that they have done nothing wrong to deserve being excluded from these emergency programs. Will the government fix the rent support program so that tenants can apply, instead of leaving it up to landlords, and so businesses can get the help they desperately need? hon. We've been working on offering a response for small businesses and charities and non-profit organizations, and we are continuing to listen on the ground to how we can better assist the businesses that fall through the cracks. Chair, when the government rolled out its commercial rent support program, why didn't it negotiate an eviction moratorium with the provinces, as Australia and other countries did, to protect business owners? hon. We've recognized it and we've been working with the provinces and territories to implement the Canada emergency commercial rent the chair: We'll go back to Mr. gord johns: To qualify for the Canada emergency wage subsidy, a 30% drop in revenue has to be shown. Anyone who's owned a business knows that even with this program, it's going to be hard to survive. Why is the government using a 70% measurement drop to qualify for the rent support program, but a 30% drop for the wage subsidy? hon. We've been working with provinces and territories to provide forgivable loans to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rents for their tenants by 75%. We're hoping that tenants and landlords will be working together so we can support businesses during this very difficult crisis. the chair: Before we move on to the next question, Mr.Berthold, did you have a question or a point of order? mr. I checked the clock from the first round of five minutes, and as you may recall, it took a very long time for me to get an answer from the government. During my first turn, it took 50seconds before a government minister deigned to answer my questions. After checking my time, I realized that the discussion between Ms.McKenna and I went on for four minutes and 14seconds, so I wasn't able to ask the minister one final question, a very important one. I would ask you to take that into account and allow me to ask MinisterMcKenna one last question, please. the chair: The person chairing the meeting uses their judgment and does their best to keep an eye on what's going on. I think it's more or less equal for all the members, but I apologize if the honourable member feels that he was denied a few seconds. bill blair: The decision to close the border was made in Canada by Canadians in the best interest of Canadians. todd doherty: When will the government be in a position to inform Canadians of any changes to the agreement? hon. bill blair: I'm pleased to advise the member that we're continuing to monitor the situation, but I'm strongly of the opinion that the circumstances on both sides of our border do not indicate that this is the right time to make a change in the restrictions. todd doherty: Can the government confirm whether there are any discussions about reopening the border to certain modes of transportation and restricting others? the chair: Before I go to the minister, I want to remind the honourable members that we do have translators, and they are trying to translate. With respect to them, I know we're trying to get as many questions in as possible, but they do have to translate them, so please be considerate of our interpreters. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Let me please inform the honourable member that we are, of course, aware that the current agreement expires. navdeep bains: We are engaged with the industry, and we are working with them on a solution, Mr. Chair, will this relief package include funding for airline ticket refunds similar to what other countries around the world have done? Yes or no? hon. Chair, I can confirm that Air Canada has now adopted a policy of checking temperatures for passengers boarding Air Canada flights. Last week I asked the Minister of Labour if they were aware of a letter written on April 6 by CUPE to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Minister, were you aware of that letter? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly. todd doherty: On April 6, CUPE wrote a letter to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Before that I had conversations with CUPE with respect to flight attendants and the use of personal protective equipment. todd doherty: Can the minister confirm whether or not they have provided PPE to the flight attendants and/or training for front-line staff for airlines and airports? hon. This has become a policy to ensure the safety not only of passengers on board but also of the flight attendants and flight crew. He stated that he couldn't give his small business tenants a break on rent because the government is penalizing him for paying off his mortgage. Chair, as you know, we laid out the CECRA program just last week, and we are encouraging landlords to take that opportunity to support the renters. Is the minister aware of this, and are they trying to revise the CECRA program? hon. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with provinces and territories to present that program. We are asking, actually encouraging, landlords to do their part and help tenants, like the one you mentioned, go through this. It's been heartbreaking, frankly, to hear that everything they've built and sacrificed for is in serious jeopardy, and through no fault of their own. Your government has created programs that are supposed to help them, but many legitimate businesses aren't able to apply. I'm hoping to hear specifics, not just nice words, on what you're going to do to help them. First, businesses that recently incorporatedfor example, in late 2019are unable to apply their entire 2019 payroll. As a result, many are falling short of the $20,000 payroll threshold required to qualify for this loan. What is your government going to do about these three scenarios? the chair: I just want to remind honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly to the minister. As well, please take into consideration the interpreters, who have to listen and translate, so that we can have this conversation. Right from the very beginning, we've always said that we will listen and that we will work to make sure that measures go out to help our Canadian small businesses. She's absolutely right: 98% of all our businesses in this country are small businesses, so they absolutely contribute enormously to our communities and are job creators. For the Canada emergency business account, over 550,000 small businesses have been approved and are getting that support. I can assure the honourable member that we will continue to do this work so that businesses, all businesses, are supported, whether it is helping keep your employees together, helping with rent support, helping to keep your business's expenses low, or of course helping with the capital that is needed so that you can pay your operating expenses and your bills through this difficult time. Moving on, there are two issues regarding the 50% commercial rent assistance subsidy, where landlords pay 25%, the government pays 50%, and the tenant is responsible for 25%. First, many of the small landlords aren't able to take a 25% hit to their income, and are unable to provide the subsidy to their tenants. Second, with the 70% decline in revenue threshold for small businesses to even be eligible for the rent assist, many restaurants are at 65% or 67% decline. What is the government planning to do to streamline this program for small businesses that can't access but desperately need the rent subsidy? hon. Chair, as the Minister of Official Languages, I just want to raise the fact that interpretation is very complicated right now. In order to make sure that we can continue to uphold bilingualism within the House, I would love it if my colleagues could take down the pace a bit. I just want to remind everyone again that when you're asking a question, make sure you are doing it at a pace at which you're considering the people who are interpreting ms. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with the provinces and territories to provide this forgivable loan to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rent of their tenants by 75%. It will be very important that we understand what happens across the country, and we will monitor and adapt the program as we ms. Chair, it has been in the media quite a bit that this rent subsidy is not helping many, many, many small business owners. It's falling short of everything that was announced, so I think it needs to be taken a bit more seriously than that. We know that some still fall through the cracks and we will look at how we can continue to support businesses across the country. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We are now going to Mr. Three weeks ago, on April 17, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced funding of $500 million to assist Canada's arts, sports and cultural sectors. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Madam Chair, we will be releasing the details of that announcement, and how the money is going to be spent, in the coming days. kevin waugh: We all know that many media organizations, large and small, in Canada are struggling right now. Allegations have arisen that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, is currently engaging in predatory behaviour and taking advantage of the current situation to harm its competitors using rate cuts. kevin waugh: Local community and ethnic media outlets and papers have strong ties to their communities that often go much deeper than the major media outlets. Is the government currently using any local or ethnic media outlets to provide crucial coronavirus information through advertising? hon. We need to get the information to Canadians on COVID-19, which is why we have started an ad-buy campaign of $30 million, which is being distributed in more than 900 local, regional and national newspapers across the country and 500 radio and TV stations in 12 different languages, including Farsi, Mandarin, Spanish, Italian and many more. It has received two ads from an ad agency in connection with the $30 million the government is doling out to help media outlets. Is this the kind of money you're attempting to dole out to help media: two ads in eight weeks? hon. steven guilbeault: Madam Chair, we have been doing a number of things for our media in Canada over the last few months and will continue to do so. On top of that $30 million ad-buy campaign, we have been investing $50 million in local journalism. Just this year, it means that 200 journalists will be hired in areas across the country where journalism is more poorly defined. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, last week, as the minister would know, 15 community newspapers, including eight in Manitoba and seven in the province of Ontario, closed their doors for good. Is the government currently planning any further measures aimed at assisting community or ethnic media organizations? We understand that many more will close their doors within the next 30 to 60 days. steven guilbeault: We are planning a number of other measures, some of which will be included in the $500 million. Of the $595 million that the media will receive, we have a tax credit that has now entered into force, and the cheques should be in the mail by the end of the summer. So there are a number of things we've done and a number of things we will be doing in the coming months as well. kevin waugh: Well, finally, you have the five members associated with that committee to dole out the $595 million. colleague that in order for us to provide tax breaks for the 2019 period, media outlets had to file their tax returns so we could go ahead. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. This being the first time I've had the floor during a virtual sitting of Parliament, I'd like to take this opportunity to greet my fellow members, all 259participants. I'd like to talk about the Prime Minister's appearance on the show Tout le monde en parle. This is what he had to say about his economic recovery plan:     We are going to remain focused on the economy as a wholeinnovationresearch and science, the green economy and a fairer economyThere are things we are all reflecting on right now that reflection is going to continue. Can the government assure Canadians that it is being proactive and working on a plan to get the economy moving again? It must act now. Our government is wholly committed to restarting the economy, and we are working closely with the provinces to do just that. Last week, our government, together with the provincial and territorial premiers, released the principles that will guide efforts to restore economic activity across the country. jol godin: MadamChair, before we go any further, since it took a while for the minister, or the government, to answer the question, can I have that time back to ask questions? the acting chair (mrs. The Prime Minister's answer during his appearance on Tout le monde en parle didn't inspire much confidence and doesn't line up with the Deputy Prime Minister's comments. How can the government be proud of announcing $252million in assistance for the agri-food sector, when that is less than 1% of all the program funding the government has committed to help Canadians get through the COVID-19 crisis? Clearly, the government doesn't see the food supply chain as a priority and has no regard for farmers and pork and beef producers. Does the government realize that eating is vital to Canadians? When is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food going to adjust the program and show respect for Canadian farmers? hon. This week, we focused on beef and pork producers and processors, as well as sectors with product surpluses that can be redirected to food banks. I can assure my fellow member that this is an additional step and that more supports are on the way in the weeks ahead. PortneufJacques-Cartier is home to a company that is already licensed by Health Canada and that, for 20years, has been manufacturing medical equipment including masks, face shields and thermometers. In mid-March, Health Canada reached out to the company to find out how much equipment it could manufacture to help fight COVID-19. The company confirmed that it could immediately start producing 200,000masks a week, ramping up to a million masks over the next few weeks. Can the health minister tell us why, 45days later, this company licensed by Health Canada hasn't received an order? hon. Industry and suppliers have enthusiastically answered our call to equip Canada with products and goods during the crisis. Seniors living alone are most at risk of economic insecurity, particularly single senior women, as gender inequality in the job market has translated all too often into inadequate retirement income. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a poverty reduction plan that addresses the unique challenges faced by older women? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to assure the member that we are quite aware that this pandemic has typically affected single seniors, and many of those, given that they live longer, are single senior women. I want to assure her that we are working on this issue, and we have provided some supports already through measures such as the GST supplementary payment. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, older women represent a high proportion of residents in long-term care facilities. Having spent their lives caring for parents, children and often their partners, they find themselves needing care in nursing homes. Multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Canada have highlighted systemic gaps that senior and elderly women may face in such facilities, as well as the working conditions of the female-dominated ranks of nurses and personal support workers. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a federal strategy for long-term care homes that recognizes quality of life for residents and working conditions for the employees, ideally one that goes hand in hand with a poverty reduction plan and enhanced home and community care investments across the country? hon. We are obviously deeply saddened by the outbreaks that have been going on in long-term care facilities and those who have lost their lives. We do recognize that the administration of long-term care and palliative care is the responsibility of provinces and territories; however, we have been taking a team Canada approach, and as you already know, we've been doing tremendous work with them to try to ensure that those who live in those facilities can be well cared for and safe. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, from May 4 to May 10, we are observing Mental Health Week. We know that our essential workers right now are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety, on top of putting their own physical safety and health on the line. Most of these workers work in precarious jobs with no access to paid sick leave or vacation, and without any benefits to access mental health services. Apart from the very welcome investments in online resources, can the minister explain how the government will support these workers now and once the crisis is behind us? hon. I'm so glad that she's raising the issue of mental health and in particular how poor mental health is oftentimes connected to our socio-economic status. We do have new resources that are available to all Canadians free of charge through the Wellness Together portal, but there is more to do. I think the announcement of top-up wages, for example, which the Prime Minister spoke about today, is another example of how we're taking the health and wellness of all low-income Canadians very seriously. We know that mental health is not divorced from socio-economic status, and I look forward to working with her more on other measures that we can take together. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, we're all very aware of the importance of temporary foreign workers and their role in ensuring our food sovereignty across this country. How are we protecting them? Madam Chair, will the government take action to strengthen legislation and ensure Canadians have access to the food they need while the workers who help bring it to our tables have safe working conditions, regardless of where they are working in this country? hon. We are very concerned, as are countries around the world, that we support and create the environment for the health and safety of our temporary foreign workers and we value their contribution to our food supply chain here in Canada. We have issued guidelines to employers and are working very closely with local public health authorities in the provinces and territories to make sure workers are protected, that physical distancing and other recommendations are adhered to and that there are severe consequences if employers don't take care of their workers. alistair macgregor (cowichanmalahatlangford, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. My first question is this: Will the Liberal government prevent federal bailout funds from going to companies that use tax havens and avoid paying their fair share here in Canada, yes or no? hon. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): We are working to make sure that anyone who tries to circumvent the rules faces serious consequences. Anyone who abuses the program could face fines of up to 225% of the subsidy amount as well as five years in prison. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, I didn't really hear a yes to that question, so I'll repeat it. Does the government really think it's appropriate for tax-avoiding corporations to receive funding provided for by taxpayers? hon. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, the agriculture funding announced by the government earlier this week amounts to less than 10% of what the Canadian Federation of Agriculture estimates will be required to help farmers weather this crisis. I have to remind my colleague that we have put in $5 billion through FCC, $50 million for the temporary foreign workers, two times $50 million for pork and beef producers this week, and $77 million for food processing. This is only the beginning, and we should not forget that the business risk management programs are still there to offer support. alistair macgregor: Yes, Madam Chair, but we're nearly two months into this pandemic and this announcement only came this week. marie-claude bibeau: Madam Chair, we are working closely with the farmers and their representatives to identify where the gaps are, but once again, we have made improvements to the AgriStability program. They can get, depending on the province, either 50% or 75% in advance payments, and they can also, right now, access their AgriInvest program. There is more than $2 billion ready to access today, if they have the acting chair (mrs. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, federal disability recipients and seniors on fixed incomes have been hardest hit by cost of living increases from COVID-19. If we acknowledge that $2,000 per month is the minimum needed to get through this time, why are they being asked to survive on far less? When can they expect assistance, and how much will they receive? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to make sure people realize that we have provided some assistance through the GST supplementary benefit. We are also providing support to those who are still working, and we have done that by allowing them to access the CERB. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, as I think we've heard through today's question period, there are countless example of this government designing programs to exclude many small businesses that desperately need help. Whether it's the payroll requirements or other eligibility, we still, to this day, almost two months into the pandemic, have too many small businesses falling through the cracks. Madam Chair, why has the government taken this approach and when can we finally expect fixes to the whole system? hon. mary ng: Madam Chair, right from the get-go, we have been committed to making sure that Canadians are helped through this crisis, and that small businesses get the support that they need, so that we are saving businesses and jobs in this country. yves perron (berthiermaskinong, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I hear the questions my fellow members are asking, and to be frank, I don't find the answers satisfactory. It is well and good to talk about existing programs, but they aren't working, so enough with that refrain. This morning, both farmers and processors came together for a press conference at the Union des producteurs agricoles's head office in Longueuil. Can the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food therefore tell us when she will announce significant supports for the industry? hon. marie-claude bibeau: We have already announced significant amounts of support, and more is on the way. It's not that the programs aren't working; it's that they aren't generous enough in farmers' eyes. That's why I'm working with my provincial counterparts to make improvements to programming, including AgriStability. After using the online AgriStability benefit estimator, a pork producer found out that he would get $11 per head, as they say in the industry. Pork producers are calling for $20 per head, so it's a good start, even though it's not enough and it isn't what they are asking for. We want to keep working together, but farmers have to access the money available to them through AgriStability. Even before the crisis, we were hearing from people in the industry that the programs were neither suitable nor sufficient. A few days ago, the government announced $50million in funding for pork producers, even though they are asking for $20per hog for 27million hogs. When is the government going to announce a whole lot more in funding support? What's been announced so far is only 10% of what farmers are asking for. However, I would point out to the member that, when it comes to AgriRecovery, we made an exception to the rule. That's two funding envelopes of $50million each to help cover the additional costs from the decrease in plant processing capacity. As the Prime Minister said, we are going to do more, and we are moving forward step by step. yves perron: What we concluded in committee this week is that the $125million is not new money. The government can't say that programs already exist and, at the same time, claim that they are new programs. Everyone knows that the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement came into force a month earlier than planned, despite the promises that had been made. An easy way to make money available without committing new spending is to provide compensation and announce programs for supply-managed sectors that got nothing. It seems to me that a time of crisis is a time for the government to practise some judo and announce measures. I am reaching out to the government, as I always do, but it has to come forward with announcements. marie-claude bibeau: Our commitment to farmers in supply-managed sectorsmeaning, egg, poultry and dairy farmersis as strong as it always was. Support for poultry and egg farmers is in the form of investment programs, which aligns well with the recovery. At this time, we are focusing on emergency programs to help farmers hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. As you know, legislative changes are needed to grant the Canadian Dairy Commission's request and increase its borrowing limit by $200million so it can buy more butter and cheese. Chair, we're all inundated, as we've heard during this entire question period, with Canadians' concerns about the economic restrictions and the social restrictions that they're under. Over the last couple of months, the WHO has given one very consistent message in terms of coming out of those economic and social restrictions. Tedros said in his briefing, We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. On March 25, 44 days ago, he said, Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictionstheyre also the best way to prevent them. Does the minister agree with the WHO that relentless testing and tracing are critical to a successful economic and social relaunch strategy in Canada? hon. Absolutely, we agree that testing and contact tracing will form an important part of our response to living with COVID. We've been investing heavily in ensuring that we have the lab capacity, the collaboration across provinces and territories, and the variety of testing options to help us increase our capacity to test. We are aiming right now for a high volume of tests, but I will also say that in Canada we have one of the highest testing rates in the world. Although we're doing well, I can assure him that I am with him and I believe we need to do more. Chair, as I mentioned to his colleagues yesterday, we have currently the capacity to do approximately 60,000 tests per day across the country. Chair, it's hard for me to get that exact number, but I will get back to him with the exact number. She said, As a first tranche, roughly close to 60,000 is where the provinces can potentially expand to as a target already. Does the minister happen to know, ballpark, what the average number of daily tests in Canada has been since that statement? hon. patty hajdu: Your estimate was slightly higher than what my estimate was going to be, so that's a great piece of news. Listen, I will just say that I think if the premise here is that we could be doing more testing. I would agree, but I will also say that the provinces and territories are working incredibly hard on testing strategies that meet their own specific needs. Tam works with all the chief public health officers across the country to ensure that their testing strategy is going to be applicable and appropriate for their particular jurisdictions. mike lake: Following up on that, is there a jurisdiction in Canada where relentless testing is not the appropriate strategy as provinces consider relaunching? hon. For example, in British Columbia, where there are relatively fewer cases in general and less disease activity, they may have a different testing strategy than a province like Ontario, which is currently struggling with more outbreaks. mike lake: Given your comment that our current testing capability is 60,000, and acknowledging that only at one point in the entire history of our COVID response, over several months, has our weekly average been over 30,000it was about 31,000 for one day on a rolling basisMinister, are you satisfied with our current testing amounts right now, given that we're testing 50% of what the public health officer advises would be best? hon. patty hajdu: I'm so amazed by the work the provinces and territories have done in a very short time to increase their capacity. We are supporting them with the tools that they need to get more testing done, but also to have other components in place that will allow them to do the rapid tracing of positive cases. I think it's very important to remember that testing strategies will be different across the provinces, based on the outbreak disease epidemiology. Having said that, I know that we can all do better, and I'm certain that my counterparts feel the same"

        "Query": "What were the team's decisions and solutions regarding the remote control's visibility, ease of finding, and prevention of loss during the discussion of technical issues, market interests, and the function of \"glow in the dark\"?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed various options for the remote control design. User Interface suggested a base station next to the TV, but it was deemed technically complicated and costly. Marketing proposed implementing an audio signal, which was ultimately adopted. There were debates about where to place the logo on the remote. Project Manager suggested printing it on a button, but User Interface was concerned about wear and tear. Industrial Designer suggested putting it on the back, but visibility was an issue. User Interface proposed a two-piece remote, but it didn't align with the cover design. Finally, it was agreed to leave a cut-out space on the latex covers to display the logo. The team decided on a beeping feature for when the remote gets lost and a fixed charger to prevent loss. Marketing suggested additional features like beeping or blinking lights when clapping, and a signal when in a dark spot. However, voice and clapping were deemed insufficient, and the team settled on glow-in-the-dark material combined with speech recognition for easy location. This choice was cost-effective and believed to boost market sales.",
        "Article": "user interface: project manager: and  , I'll be taking minutes on this one , and  Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for  myself , because it'll be more about  , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , marketing: industrial designer: which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . industrial designer: so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to  allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are .  , from  , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or  something fam familiar . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just  take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . So if we lost the  remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room .  , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design .  , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects ,  we've learnt about smart materials where   specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . user interface: marketing: industrial designer: So they can be heated and  and cooled , and they change the shape of  the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So  , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated ,  everything would spring apart . So , all the  individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much  responsibility for all the  companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . project manager: So that , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? industrial designer:  And then Yeah . Yeah they would ,  you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy .  , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made .  , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . Would we be the company that would break down these , or  metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ? industrial designer: You could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . industrial designer: but project manager: One thing we have to consider is our  one hundred percent  turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . project manager: so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Well I the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de  deconstructed . industrial designer: So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high  quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but project manager: Alright . project manager: I'm sorry , could you industrial designer: There we go project manager: Those were  industrial designer: .  , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . industrial designer: Okay ? So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? Or escape ? There we go . Can you see ? marketing: Oh , user interface: Do you think Is it  , function eight yeah ? project manager: Yeah .  , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international .  , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . user interface: I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use .  , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . Does anyone have any questions ? marketing: So as far as we know , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? user interface: Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it  compatible with different brands of devices . user interface: And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , marketing: D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? user interface: yeah , project manager: Right . project manager: Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? industrial designer: I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . Do you think ? marketing: Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . project manager: Alright , well , marketing: project manager: are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ? marketing: Yes I am . Except you're not hooked up to the marketing: Oh , user interface: marketing: I'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready .  , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first  kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly .  , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , and some internet research . project manager: I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ? marketing: we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . marketing: Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , industrial designer:  . marketing: you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . project manager: I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ? marketing: Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . marketing: As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . project manager: And another thing with  lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be  a lot more durable , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: because I find with  channel-changers that , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button . marketing: And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the  relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used .  , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . user interface: It has T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . marketing: So like a running banner , underneath project manager: No it's a button that you press , and then you , like a menu pops up . industrial designer: It's like user interface: And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up . industrial designer: Yeah , it's just information that  , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and marketing: Right . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , industrial designer: To get the right reception and picture , I suppose . marketing: Is that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ? project manager: That's rather sad . industrial designer: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: maybe our industrial designer: Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . marketing: But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control .  , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . project manager: I agree with  if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . project manager: and especially if we are  trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . project manager: ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . marketing: So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway . industrial designer: And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , project manager: industrial designer: but could be very difficult to get the specific  design . project manager: We need to decide if that is our  intention is , is a simplistic design . project manager: because if , if it is then I think voice ,  voice-activated marketing: It looks like project manager: Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , marketing: project manager: because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure .  an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . industrial designer: What , what would appear on the screen ? project manager: I have no idea still . marketing: now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . Could it it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . But that would probably be industrial designer: Like linked in with the teletext , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . user interface: marketing: Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . Every remote control looks the same , so  in my opinion it should be , user-friendly and unique . user interface: marketing: So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product industrial designer:  .  if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . user interface: And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out marketing: you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . marketing: so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . And if one of the largest , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , user interface: Twenties . project manager: I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . Before we go into  more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions .  , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control .  , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television  function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Another thing that might  affect other decisions is that  the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . industrial designer: Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? project manager: well ,  we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , industrial designer: Yeah . This is for the design , the design of the product is that  we wanna create ,  more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , all the remote controls must have our  We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . project manager: So , perhaps  our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . project manager: it doesn't have to be the colour of our  of our company industrial designer: Just project manager: but , another thing is that ,  industrial designer: project manager: we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon .  , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be  somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .  , so , now we need to discuss ,  and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . industrial designer: marketing: Okay , so I Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: I think it would be annoying though if I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if project manager: Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous . project manager: Do you know if anywhere else has it ? industrial designer: I don't know . industrial designer: But if Was it a management decision that we're having project manager: It was a management decision , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point . industrial designer: Minimal marketing: And the What was the word they used ? F findability is important . project manager: 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared user interface: Yeah . user interface: Would you be able to , put the little device anywhere ? 'Cause  isn't our remote control for all T_V_s , so industrial designer: If user interface: you'd ha industrial designer: Do you mean the the link between the user interface: Yeah , with the button that you pressed . user interface: C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . project manager: Yeah , it would have t industrial designer: Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be  yeah not very obtrusive . Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . user interface: Would it need a battery then ? project manager: Maybe ,  industrial designer: Pr probably . industrial designer: Unless it could be project manager: That's your department you'll have to sort that out .  , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . project manager: Yeah , you'll have to industrial designer: So , more research into that one . project manager: Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that , user interface: industrial designer: Yeah .  , alright , and I'm sure that , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system ,  is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ? industrial designer: Y marketing: On the buttons ? user interface: I I like the light up suggestion . user interface: 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: it doesn't user interface: I would go for marketing: It could it could be a tactile thing as well .  right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . industrial designer: Like a raised marketing: and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S user interface: Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? Like raised . user interface: Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ? industrial designer: Yeah marketing: Yeah . marketing: I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . project manager: But  industrial designer: And also y ,  Heather you mentioned before ,  like how it should be accessible to everybody . industrial designer: So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody . Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . project manager: 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , like the actual soft plastic , costs that much more than other colours . marketing: I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , industrial designer: Yeah . I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . marketing: And you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . industrial designer: I project manager: for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? marketing: Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . marketing: if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . marketing: Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . industrial designer: So , self-timed marketing: So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . project manager: So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed . And it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , better for people with  els no industrial designer: durable . project manager: what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? industrial designer: Oh yeah .  , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? industrial designer: project manager: Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? user interface: If project manager: Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . industrial designer: Yeah , and we could marketing: whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . industrial designer: Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , marketing: So industrial designer: which could like link in with the company colours . industrial designer: or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so project manager: Right . user interface: I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the  Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . And do you have anything marketing: What  project manager: Do you have anything to say ? marketing: Oh sorry . So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Interchangeable thing ? marketing: Yeah , project manager: Like an iPod or something ? user interface: That would be good . marketing: And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . user interface: Yeah , and then that would be  more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . industrial designer: als project manager: You'd just get one mould , user interface: No . industrial designer: Interchan And also possible  , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or project manager: Yeah . project manager: So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out . project manager: Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? industrial designer: I've project manager: Because we need to investigate the financial implications . Is it industrial designer: Let's project manager: Does it need to be  decided on now ? Or should we industrial designer: I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion and opinions on choosing a stylish fruit for remote design.",
        "Summary": "The market research conducted by the Marketing department suggested that the ideal design for the remote should be spongy and resemble a fruit or vegetable. After considering options like banana, apple, and pear, the banana was chosen due to its appealing color and recognizable shape. The Marketing team believed that the current trend of incorporating fruits and vegetables into fashion in Milan and Paris indicated that a remote with a similar style would be both fashionable and technologically innovative. They also considered the pear as a potential shape for the remote, as it is easy to hold and preferred a spongy material for its durability. The Project Manager supported the use of spongy material and prioritized the inclusion of a wheel, as it would set their remote apart from competitors. Additionally, the Project Manager agreed that the banana would be a suitable choice due to its ease of identification.",
        "Article": "Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that .  so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And  the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . project manager: Oh is that broccoli ? industrial designer: This one's broccoli . project manager: industrial designer: The it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .  I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but project manager: 'S a very bright strawberry . industrial designer: So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out . user interface: It's been a l project manager: user interface: It's been a little bit difficult to  make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big .  but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . user interface: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the  thing the locator . user interface: Okay so that's just industrial designer: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere user interface: So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the industrial designer: Yeah we didn't design that . But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed industrial designer: project manager: we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be industrial designer: My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . industrial designer: But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means . industrial designer: marketing: project manager:  so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Do you see anything that I've missed ? industrial designer: No I think that's alright . project manager: Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . I think that's marketing: So I need where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to  decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually  meets the standards we were set at the start .  the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And  the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything's listed down .  , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And we we have therefore in total  We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . marketing:  so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own marketing: Yeah it's in the  it's in the project documents . marketing: Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? project manager:  we can do it separately and then discuss it marketing: Yeah okay . project manager: Wait , one is true and marketing: project manager: so these are the questions we're answering . And one is marketing: yes it's if it's fancy you put one , project manager: One , right okay . Should be more like Are the batteries easy to insert ? industrial designer: I'm gonna say yes . project manager: Are we just about ready ? marketing: Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . It's marketing: We'll just do  project manager: yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah . project manager: Un unless you feel you need it t to marketing: I don't feel any project manager: okay okay . industrial designer: project manager: We'll user interface: marketing: right  Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ? project manager: I I think we should industrial designer: It's four if you wanna do that . One point three is user interface: So it's a one was true and seven was false ? project manager:  . industrial designer: Huh ? user interface: Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way marketing: Well  industrial designer: Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top . user interface: I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? marketing: Yeah . Wait , is that two point one ? industrial designer: Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason . industrial designer: marketing: Okay I'll  I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue .  marketing: Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone . project manager: No no that's  I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four , where  it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote . marketing: do you want to change it ? What are the suggestions ? I don't know , anyone ? project manager:  user interface: Which one is that again sorry ? Three point one ? project manager: user interface: I think marketing: Four point two ? project manager: See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the is it  gonna be the size , like the the controller ? It or bigger ? industrial designer: I think the wheel would probably be  . project manager: Because user interface: What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: And like then it you could hold it in your hand better . industrial designer: I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of user interface: Yeah . project manager:  but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat industrial designer: Well if they're that s  stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . And would it even resemble fruit that way ? industrial designer: project manager:  user interface: Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection , project manager: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like sorta like a joystick . So industrial designer: marketing: Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ? user interface:  . marketing:  despite the user interface: I think we needn't project manager: What if  the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . project manager: But if we if we need marketing: Yeah and just have the colour match or something . And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be user interface: project manager:  if it if it in if it  conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah . user interface: Or like I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think see as like marketing: user interface: like you could if it was only this you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable . user interface: So like maybe that's just too big project manager: Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , user interface: because project manager: which is a nice kind of user interface: Yeah it's sorta like a joystick . project manager:  is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ? user interface: I guess project manager: 'Cause like kind of industrial designer: We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . project manager: Or like even user interface: Dif industrial designer: We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . project manager: And you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part . project manager: But  it do we have any other ideas about that ? marketing:  user interface: We could tr I don't know . Batteries easy to insert for some reason , industrial designer: marketing: which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more . project manager: The batteries are going in the back ? industrial designer: That everyone gave that a one or a two . project manager: The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip industrial designer: No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door , project manager: no you could Just like any other one . industrial designer: So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably . marketing: industrial designer: user interface:  so  I can't think of any So we'll have to like  . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , industrial designer: It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape . project manager: I guess we're supposed to discuss  the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh , oh it's alright . marketing: It's alright yeah ? project manager:  Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of industrial designer: Sure . marketing: user interface: The prototype making was very creatively stimulating industrial designer: user interface: and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria . project manager: And how was our leadership and teamwork ? industrial designer: I think it was good . industrial designer: Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters . project manager: Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager:  yeah , I thought we all worked very well together . user interface: Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like I don't know , all had ideas about it but project manager: Yeah . marketing: project manager:  and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? Like the the pens , the whiteboard , industrial designer: project manager:  we used industrial designer: Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff . project manager: Are you a Mac person ? industrial designer: No no I never touch Macs either . marketing: industrial designer: I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things . Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . user interface: I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role , but l but  I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda it was kinda like okay , I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations , project manager: Yeah . user interface: But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , think it's kinda stupid . project manager: It industrial designer: My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works . marketing: I though it was brilliant no ? project manager: Really ? user interface: marketing: No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think . user interface: So like a f marketing: I think it depends on the role project manager: yeah , yeah . marketing: no ? project manager: 'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff right ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . And when you were talking about it I was just like industrial designer: project manager: you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things , marketing: project manager: 'cause I industrial designer: Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . marketing: a whole system , industrial designer: marketing: 'cause of course they can't give you   anything comparable to the internet for the project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah  , it industrial designer: Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and marketing: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah I kinda thought that  I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated industrial designer: user interface: because project manager: Yeah . But  project manager: Well  we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So it's industrial designer: If I hadn't been told that fruit was marketing: But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing . given certain information or Just marketing: Yeah , like if everyone's given the same input project manager: yeah . marketing:  what's next ? Looks like oh no that's not  project manager: What do you guys think of the pens ? marketing: It's quite project manager: It asks about that . industrial designer: user interface: I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the industrial designer: They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write . project manager: And new ideas found ? industrial designer: marketing: Yeah it's all very new , project manager: Yeah . user interface: I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like . user interface:  I think , and I think that  all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company , user interface: or like I dunno . And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . project manager: industrial designer: There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company . industrial designer: And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know . industrial designer: It's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through . industrial designer: Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . industrial designer: I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and project manager: Yeah . user interface: I guess it would be it's gotta be worth it to I 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno . How about a p a ? project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  I dunno . project manager: Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? industrial designer: project manager: Any other ideas for marketing: What what's the end ? Are we are we supposed to  you supposed to write a report ? Or we ending ? project manager:  we still have time if there's any other input . marketing: Is that the end ? industrial designer: project manager:  the I think we did really well personally , which is why we've you know , gone through this so quickly . 'Cause  we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy "

The group unanimously agreed that the scroll wheel was superior to average remotes, giving it a score of two on this criterion. They also agreed that the remote scored highly in terms of locatability, initially assuming it would be intuitive.

And after a while they start to develop  some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . industrial designer: They n they need to understand what  how to change channels and  change the volume , so it's easier for them project manager: Could could I see the scroll bar as  as as a sort of shortcut ? A a and the voice recognition as well , industrial designer: Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's project manager: th maybe you could  could  industrial designer: Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our  . And and the case is is rubber ? industrial designer: Yes , rubber ? project manager: And the buttons ? user interface: Plastic or rubber . project manager: and  the colouring ? industrial designer:  yellow with  project manager: with with grey or black . project manager: Okay , user interface: project manager: we'll we'll come to that later . industrial designer: But marketing: Well , you could use two of them to programme the  channels on the two channel button , industrial designer: Yes , but it marketing: 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels . industrial designer: Or not ? project manager: M m but maybe you do want a programme button to  for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . project manager: Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Okay , well marketing: So  project manager: the then we'll switch to my presentation . project manager: Yeah , it's it's w way above   above the the the twelve Euro fifty . user interface: Why does the price and and the s oh , one  exa project manager: Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .  if you would user interface: And and does it project manager: if you look at the  w w w what we could do to make it more  to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty ,  then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells ,  by not using the voice recognition feature , industrial designer: project manager: I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out ,  user interface: So the button we can use plastic . user interface: And the pla  And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas  instead of rubber . industrial designer: Well , b basically it when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in  an enhanced case with these dull functions . Maybe we should look at an  focus on another  industrial designer: So Type of m maybe another market segment . project manager: Yeah , m  maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy    basic industrial designer: Yeah . Although I think we yeah , but we could still make  a remote control that ap   applies  more to young people  by giving it another colour already . project manager:  so it is possible to make   a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . industrial designer: Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . industrial designer: So project manager: Well industrial designer: Is it fancy ? project manager: I d it is it is marketing:  industrial designer: marketing: Yay . industrial designer:  I think  I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing . It would be even more project manager: You like tita user interface: industrial designer: oh , you really like titanium .  user interface: project manager: Yeah , I know , marketing: Is it  project manager: but but it but that's fancy in the way   fancy has has a lot of industrial designer: It has to do with fashion , I guess . user interface: It's trendy trendy , fun industrial designer: So do marketing: And w user interface: yeah . user interface: It's not the ultimate  fancy two , but industrial designer: I think I th I think it would have been I would have think  it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . user interface: Yeah , but that's sti that's  industrial designer: So user interface: Looking at the user  needs , we only  don't we don't have the double-curved case . marketing: Okay , and  was it innovative ? user interface: project manager: Well , marketing: project manager: with the voice recognition feature and  user interface: But that's not in it . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic  energy source , but it's it's way too marketing: Yeah , and  project manager: That would have been a thrill . industrial designer: yes , but marketing: So  also a  two ? industrial designer: I think  it's a two . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . industrial designer: So  It's maybe it's not very  easy for user interface: Wouldn't give it more .  two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ?  ease of use  does not only apply to the most basic functions . You're right in that , but I I guess  an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , project manager: Yeah . project manager: So I could make it e easy ? user interface: If you make it a four it will be three in general . Three ? marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Two ? marketing: two , two , three project manager: No , user interface: And a three ? project manager: I haven't said anything yet . project manager: Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . industrial designer: That's not even project manager: Does it will so it will be a two point five . marketing: industrial designer: But that's not possible to fill in , project manager: Yes , it is . It's not about the content , it's about okay ,  is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . user interface: we haven't re  re  really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . user interface: Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker  industrial designer: Yes . Maybe you have to  programme it once , so to that l respond to  a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . marketing: project manager: Well , I  industrial designer: So , I th project manager: we should not  stay too long on this subject  because of the time , but I personally give it a one . There are cases  in which the outside casing is  can be  how d how do you prono is is moldable . user interface: Was it one of our options ? industrial designer: No , it's not one of our option , marketing: No .  project manager: No okay , but but user interface: So , in the in industrial designer: but when you look in the market , when you look marketing: this this was a most spongy option . industrial designer: but that's not that's not  what they are talking about , I think . user interface: But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . industrial designer: Yes , but it's not good enough , project manager: I'll give it a one . industrial designer: You take one ? What do you give it ? marketing: Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could project manager: Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig  a number .  I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . user interface: project manager: Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? marketing: Well , the basic layout doesn't offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . project manager: What what we didn't talk about is   user interface: Yeah , but it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's If you  ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is it has all the features  a normal remote has . Bec because you can  we didn't talk about it , but you do have  remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . project manager: you place a a regular  remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the  the  the the signals . project manager: So you could    enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . But that that's its power , I guess , because  a regular programmable  remote control contains , well ,  really a lot of buttons . marketing:  I think think a one , 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like  industrial designer: Yes . I I've I think we've  succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . project manager: The product is is is  b high qua  has a high quality and and is  advanced . But whether or not our clients are are  willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure . user interface: But we could couldn't  what what's the selling price ? Fifty ? project manager: Twenty five Euros . industrial designer: That's quite ex user interface: That's price , but w w industrial designer: well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind ,  a Phillips remote control , y you pay  industrial designer: Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . user interface: Yeah , I kn I know  from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders . project manager: Bu but well yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are  remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros . industrial designer: And it's easier to use because those  remote controls don't offer voice recognition project manager: .  What did you think about  the process , the project process ? Ruud ? marketing: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: Try to translate that . project manager: Any any other  , Roo ? user interface: Yeah , I think  industrial designer: Well , I think marketing: Ye project manager: Roo . industrial designer: So And   the the the well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . industrial designer: So there was not really a process of  project manager: So we could we we could be we could've been creative . industrial designer: We we thought of possibilities who are not possible  with the the current  offer of  manufacturing components . project manager: Okay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ? user interface: No , no . project manager: I think so too , it's it's it's  of course a laboratory environment . So  user interface: marketing: project manager: Yeah , but but si  w w w when taken in account the the situation ,  I think we performed pretty well . project manager: Because of the response industrial designer: It it's project manager: or user interface: Response industrial designer: The response is very slow user interface: and industrial designer: and the possibilities are very limited . The p the pointing of the pen is not  the place where it it writes its   where it  marketing: Draws . project manager: Okay , so user interface: So  project manager: it it had to be  better aligned , or what's the word ? user interface: You to take in account that your you m project manager:  yeah . user interface: It's too slow project manager: It it was calibrated just before this meeting . industrial designer: It is ? project manager: So  it's not the calibration , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  Ruud , w  did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ? marketing: No . user interface: If it has O_C_R_ ,  I think  I would use , but  I I just  took notes for myself and and and that's it . user interface: So industrial designer: But I think it's a great solution for  for  a known problem ,  writing down some notes , some some inf  information , and then  forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . industrial designer: Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way .  What w  Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ? marketing: Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit , project manager: Yeah . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or user interface: Yeah . project manager: Or the other way around , that you could show but m industrial designer: Yes , yes . project manager: I know , but user interface: So it's almost project manager: I know , but we couldn't use that feature , user interface: yeah . industrial designer: And and  w you were when you're using  Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons ,  which you can use for drawing . industrial designer: user interface: industrial designer:  we're done , we're finished , I believe . Thank you for your industrial designer: But  how much time did we get for this meeting ? project manager: Forty minutes . project manager: So , we can  redesign our   I would like to industrial designer: Well , I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . industrial designer: No , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market "

He believed that the effort put into developing a good Voice Activity Detection (VAD) was worthwhile. In order to determine the latency added by the VAD, the professor suggested running the process in parallel. Additionally, the professor informed the team that the maximum latency was still unknown. PhD C provided an explanation of the delays caused by various factors, including a 100ms delay from silence probabilities, a 40ms delay from delta at the input, and a 10ms delay from LDA filters. The professor criticized the insistence on using a flawed system and emphasized the need for straightforward solutions. He emphasized the importance of keeping the lag short for the task at hand.",
        "Article": "professor c: OK , what are we talking about today ? phd b: I don't know . phd a: Oh , this was the , talk where they were supposed to try to decide phd b: To to decide what to do , phd a: Ah , right .  , so  , let 's let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead , phd b: Yeah . professor c: because even if they tell us that , the rules are different , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing .  , well , we 've a little bit worked on trying to see , what were the bugs and the problem with the latencies . phd d: To improve phd b: So , We took first we took the LDA filters and , we designed new filters , using  recursive filters actually . professor c: So when you say \" we \" , is that something Sunil is doing or is that ? phd b: I 'm sorry ? professor c: Who is doing that ? phd b: us . phd b: So we took the filters the FIR filters and we designed , IIR filters that have the same frequency response . phd b: So they had two filters , one for the low frequency bands and another for the high frequency bands . And the low frequency band has sixty - four milliseconds of delay , and the high frequency band filter has something like eleven milliseconds compared to the two hundred milliseconds of the IIR filters . So we have the filters but we still have to implement a routine that does recursive filtering professor c: OK . phd b: and professor c: You you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ? phd b: No . professor c: right ? So so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing , phd b: Yeah .  , I yeah , I don't know if th that 's what they were trying to They were trying to do something different like taking ,  well , using filter that takes only a past professor c: Right . I think that the the fact that we we did that with had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication . Well , there is w one , remark about these filters , that they don't have a linear phase . phd b: Well , I don't know , perhaps it perhaps it doesn't hurt because the phase is almost linear but .  , and so , yeah , for the delay I gave you here , it 's it 's , computed on the five hertz modulation frequency , which is the mmm , well , the most important for speech so . professor c: So that would be , a reduction of a hundred and thirty - six milliseconds , phd d: The low f f phd b: Yeah . professor c: which ,  What was the total we ended up with through the whole system ? phd b: Three hundred and thirty . professor c: So that would be within ? phd b: Yeah , but there are other points actually , which will perhaps add some more delay . Is that some other other stuff in the process were perhaps not very  perf well , not very correct , like the downsampling which w was simply dropping frames . phd b: so we will try also to add a nice downsampling having a filter that that professor c:  - huh .  , because wh when when we look at the LDA filters , well , they are basically low - pass but they leave a lot of what 's above twenty - five hertz . phd b: and so , yeah , this will be another filter which would add ten milliseconds again . phd b: yeah , and then there 's a third thing , is that , basically the way on - line normalization was done  , is just using this recursion on on the  , on the feature stream , professor c: Yeah .  , and when we look at this filter actually it has a delay of eighty - five milliseconds . If we want to be very correct , so if we want to the estimation of the mean t t to to be well , the right estimation of the mean , we have to t to take eighty - five milliseconds in the future . We would be at six so , sixty - five , plus ten , plus for the downsampling , plus eighty - five for the on - line normalization . So it 's professor c: phd b: plus plus eighty for the neural net and PCA . phd b: So it would be around two hundred and forty so , well , professor c: Just just barely in there . phd a: What 's the allowable ? professor c: Two - fifty , unless they changed the rules . phd a: What were they thinking of changing it to ? professor c: But phd b: Yeah . professor c: well the people who had very low latency want it to be low  , very very very narrow , latency bound . professor c: Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency , but phd a: Ah ! professor c: But , phd b: Yeah , and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency . professor c: Yeah , so they were basically  , they were more or less trading computation for performance and we were , trading latency for performance . And they were dealing with noise explicitly and we weren't , and so I think of it as complementary , that if we can put the phd a: Think of it as what ? professor c: Complementary . professor c: I think the best systems so , everything that we did in in a way it was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system , which is something actually , we 've done a lot over the last thirteen years . So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise . And , we did this , RASTA - like filtering which was done in the log domain and was tending to handle convolutional noise . So , the , spectral sub subtraction schemes a couple places did seem to seem to do a nice job . And so , we 're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff . I think you should be able to end up with a system that 's better than both but clearly the way that we 're operating for this other stuff does involved some latency to to get rid of most of that latency . To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we 'd have to throw out most of what we 're doing . And and , I don't think there 's any good reason for it in the application actually .  , you 're you 're you 're speaking to a recognizer on a remote server and , having a a a quarter second for some processing to clean it up . professor c: These aren't large vocabulary things so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time , and . phd a: And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency . What what does wa was your experience when you were doing this stuff with , the the the surgical , microscopes and so forth .  , how long was it from when somebody , finished an utterance to when , something started happening ? phd a: we had a silence detector , so we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector . phd a: And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance . phd a: but it was , I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds . phd a: So professor c: Yeah , so you you so you had a phd a: this w professor c: so you had a a quarter second delay before , plus some little processing time , phd a: Right . professor c: And there 's physical inertia there , so probably the the motion itself was all phd a: And it felt to , the users that it was instantaneous . professor c: Yeah , so you would think as long as it 's under half a second or something . A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds , and I 'm not even sure if we can tell the difference between a quarter of a second and half a second .  , basically if you yeah , if you said , \" what 's the ,  what 's the shortest route to the opera ? \" and it took half a second to get back to you , phd a: Yeah . phd a: because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other 's utterances . So like if I 'm asking you a question , you may start answering before I 'm even done . Well , anyway , I think we could cut we know what else , we could cut down on the neural net time by by , playing around a little bit , going more into the past , or something like that . phd a: So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ? professor c:   professor c: And there 's also well , there 's the neural net and there 's also this , multi - frame , KLT . phd a: Wasn't there Was it in the , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all ? professor c: They weren't looking ahead much . And and then But you also could just , we haven't experimented with this but I imagine you could , predict a , a label , from more in the past than in than than in the future . phd a: but I don't think professor c: Yeah , but we 've but we played a little bit with with asymmetric , guys . So , that 's what that 's what you 're busy with , s messing around with this , phd b: yeah . And , phd d: Also we were thinking to to , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson phd b: Yeah . professor c: phd a: What is the advantage of that ? phd d:  phd b: Well , it 's that by the for the moment we have , something that 's discriminant and nonlinear . Well , it 's it 's a linear transformation , that  professor c: So at least just to understand maybe what the difference was between how much you were getting from just putting the frames together and how much you 're getting from the discriminative , what the nonlinearity does for you or doesn't do for you . Actually what we want to do , perhaps it 's to replace to to have something that 's discriminant but linear , also . And to see if it if it improves ov over over the non - discriminant linear transformation . professor c: Yeah , well , that 's what I meant , is to see whether whether it having the neural net really buys you anything . professor c: But maybe it 's just the discrimination and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary . But the other part you were saying was the spectral subtraction , so you just kind of ,  phd b: Yeah . professor c: At what stage do you do that ? Do you you 're doing that ,  ? phd b: So it would be on the  on on the mel frequency bands , phd d: We was think phd b: so . professor c: OK , phd d: Yeah , professor c: so just do that on the mel f phd d: we no nnn We we was thinking to do before after VAD or phd b: Yeah , phd d: Oh , we don't know exactly when it 's better . phd b:  phd d: Before after VAD or professor c: So so you know that that that the way that they 're phd d: and then phd b:  . professor c: one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , run a good VAD , and and determine boundaries . professor c: The reason for that was that ,  if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't , or one had a better VAD than the other since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the the task , and that any any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection . It still wouldn't be perfect but  , e the argument was \" let 's not have that be part of this test . \" And so , I guess they argued about that yesterday and , yeah , I 'm sorry , I don't don't know the answer but we should find out . So ,  Yeah , so there 's the question of the VAD but otherwise it 's it 's on the the ,  the mel fil filter bank , energies I guess ? phd d:   professor c: And you 're you 're subtracting in the in the in the I guess it 's power power domain , or or magnitude domain . phd b: and professor c: if you look at the theory , it 's it should be in the power domain but but , I 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain phd b: Yeah . professor c: I have asked people why and they shrug their shoulders and say , \" oh , it works . professor c: and there 's this I guess there 's this mysterious  people who do this a lot I guess have developed little tricks of the trade .  , there 's there 's this ,  you don't just subtract the the estimate of the noise spectrum . phd b: so you have the estimation of the power spectra of the noise , and you multiply this by a factor which is depend dependent on the SNR . phd a:  ! phd b: When the speech lev when the signal level is more important , compared to this noise level , the coefficient is small , and around one . But when the power le the s signal level is  small compared to the noise level , the coefficient is more important . And this reduce actually the music musical noise , phd a: Oh ! phd b:  which is more important during silence portions , phd a:  - huh . professor c: Well , that 's  , that 's what differs from different different tasks and different s  , spectral subtraction methods . phd a:  ! professor c: if if you have , fair assurance that , the noise is is quite stationary , then the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise , get a much better estimate , and subtract it off . professor c: But if it 's varying at all , which is gonna be the case for almost any real situation , you have to do it on - line , with some forgetting factor or something . phd a: So do you is there some long window that extends into the past over which you calculate the average ? professor c: Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum . So one of the things that , Hans - Guenter Hirsch did ,  and pas and other people actually , he 's he wasn't the only one I guess , was to , take some period of of of speech and in each band , develop a histogram . And , in fact I think the NIST standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this . phd a: A couple seconds ? professor c: So No , no , it 's based on this kind of method , phd a:  . Now , if you have signal and you have noise , you basically have these two bumps in the histogram , which you could approximate as two Gaussians . professor c: So so basically now you have this mixture of two Gaussians , you you n know what they are , and , sorry , you estimate what they are , and , so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum . And the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to , determine through magical means that that , there 's no speech in some period , and then see what the spectrum is .  , a variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio is to just ,  you can do a w a  an iterative thing , EM - like thing , to determine means only . professor c: And then you just use those mean values as being the the ,   signal - to - noise ratio in that band . phd a: But what is the it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency . Cuz if you don't look into the future , right ? phd a: OK , well that I guess that was my question , professor c: if you just yeah phd a: yeah . professor c: if you just if you you ,  a at the beginning you have some phd a: Guess . professor c: esti some guess and and ,  phd b: Yeah , but it professor c: It 's an interesting question . I wonder how they did do it ? phd b: Actually , it 's a mmm If - if you want to have a good estimation on non - stationary noise you have to look in the in the future .  , if you take your window and build your histogram in this window , what you can expect is to have an estimation of th of the noise in in the middle of the window , not at the end . So professor c: Well , yeah , phd b: the but but people professor c: but what does what what what does Alcatel do ? phd d:   grad e: Pretty stationary , phd b: but ,  professor c: Well , the thing , e e e e grad e: yeah . professor c: Yeah , y  , you 're talking about non - stationary noise but I think that spectral subtraction is rarely is is not gonna work really well for for non - stationary noise , phd b: Well , if y if you have a good estimation of the noise , professor c: you know ? phd b: yeah , because well it it has to work . professor c: But it 's hard to phd b: i professor c: but that 's hard to do . So so I think that that what what is wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with r slowly varying or stationary noise . professor c: If it varies a lot , to get a If if to get a good estimate you need a few seconds of speech , even if it 's centered , right ? phd b:   professor c: if you need a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it 's changed a lot in a few seconds , then it , you know , i it 's kind of a problem . professor c: imagine e five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum , phd b: Mmm . So , phd b: So in this case , yeah , sure , you cannot professor c: Yeah . phd b: But I think y  , Hirsch does experiment with windows of like between five hundred milliseconds and one second .  and he worked on non - stationary noises , like noise modulated with well , wi with amplitude modulations and things like that , phd a: Were his , windows centered around the phd b: and But  , yeah . professor c: No , I understand it 's better to do but I just think that that , for real noises wh what what 's most likely to happen is that there 'll be some things that are relatively stationary phd b: Mmm . professor c: and other things where it 's not so stationary and  , you can always pick something that that falls between your methods , phd b:  . professor c: but I don't know if , you know , if sinusoidally , modul amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice . professor c: I think that it 's  phd a: We could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files , and built the averages from them . phd b: What What do you mean ? professor c: Just cheat You 're saying , cheat . phd b: But if the if the noise is stationary perhaps you don't even need some kind of noise estimation algorithm . phd b: We just take th th th the beginning of the utterance and professor c: Oh , yeah , sure . phd b: Well , everybody seems to use some kind of adaptive , well , scheme professor c: But but phd d: Yeah . phd b: is it very useful professor c: you know , stationary phd a: Very slow adaptation . phd b: and is the c phd a: th professor c: Right , the word \" stationary \" is has a very precise statistical meaning . But , you know , in in signal - processing really what we 're talking about I think is things that change slowly , compared with our our processing techniques . professor c: So if you 're driving along in a car I I would think that most of the time the nature of the noise is going to change relatively slowly . If you if you check it out , five minutes later you may be in a different part of the road phd b:   But it 's it 's i i i using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well . professor c: But you could get hurt a lot if you just took some something from the beginning of all the speech , of , you know , an hour of speech and then later phd b: Yeah . professor c: so they may be you know , may be overly , complicated for for this test but but but , I don't know .  , if possible you shouldn't you should you should make it , the center of the center of the window .  , phd a: If they 're going to provide a , voice activity detector that will tell you the boundaries of the speech , then , couldn't you just go outside those boundaries and do your estimate there ? professor c: Oh , yeah . So I I imagine that 's what they 're doing , right ? Is they 're they 're probably looking in nonspeech sections and getting some ,  phd b: Yeah , they have some kind of threshold on on the previous estimate , and So . Yeah , so , they h they have an estimate of the noise level and they put a threshold like six or ten DB above , and what 's under this threshold is used to update the estimate . It 's like saying what 's under the threshold is silence , professor c: Does France Telecom do this phd b: and grad e:  . professor c: Does France Telecom do th do the same thing ? More or less ? phd b: I d I Y you know , perhaps ? phd d: No .  , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly , just , things that that we 've been chatting about but haven't made it into these meetings yet . So you 're coming up with your quals proposal , and ,  Wanna just give a two three minute summary of what you 're planning on doing ? grad e: Oh , two , three , it can be shorter than that .  , but I 'm , looking into extending the work done by Larry Saul and John Allen and  Mazin Rahim .  , they they have a system that 's , a multi - band , system but their multi - band is is a little different than the way that we 've been doing multi - band in the past , where  Where we 've been @ @  taking  sub - band features and i training up these neural nets and on on phonetic targets , and then combining them some somehow down the line , they 're they 're taking sub - band features and , training up a detector that detects for , these phonetic features for example , he presents  , a detector to detect sonorance . And so what what it basically is is ,  it 's there 's at the lowest level , there it 's it 's an OR ga  , it 's an AND gate . So , on each sub - band you have several independent tests , to test whether  , there 's the existence of sonorance in a sub - band . And at the at the higher level , for every if ,  The higher level there 's a soft OR gate .  , so if if this detector detects  , the presence of of sonorance in any of the sub - bands , then the detect  , the OR gate at the top says , \" OK , well this frame has evidence of sonorance . \" phd a: What are what are some of the low level detectors that they use ? grad e: And these are all Oh , OK .  , and the ,  professor c: So that , by the way , basically is a is one of the units in our in our our neural network . Yeah , so he uses , an EM algorithm to to  train up these  parameters for the logistic regression . professor c: Well , actually , yeah , grad e: The professor c: so I was using EM to get the targets . So so you have this this this AND gate what we were calling an AND gate , but it 's a product product rule thing at the output . And then he uses , i u and then feeding into that are I 'm sorry , there 's it 's an OR at the output , isn't it ? Yeah , grad e:   phd a: And so are each of these , low level detectors are they ,  are these something that you decide ahead of time , like \" I 'm going to look for this particular feature or I 'm going to look at this frequency , \" or What what what are they looking at ? grad e:  phd a: What are their inputs ? grad e:  Right , so the OK , so at each for each sub - band there are basically , several measures of SNR and and correlation .  , and for for every s every sub - band , e you you just pick ahead of time , \" I 'm going to have like five i independent logistic tests . grad e: And you initialize these parameters , in some some way and use EM to come up with your training targets for a for the the low - level detectors . grad e: And then , once you get that done , you you you train the whole whole thing on maximum likelihood .  , and h he shows that using this this method to detect sonorance is it 's very robust compared to ,  to typical , full - band Gaussian mixtures  estimations of of sonorance . You get enough of these detectors together , then you have enough information to do , higher level discrimination , for example , discriminating between phones phd a:   grad e: and then you keep working your way up until you you build a full recognizer . grad e: So , that 's that 's the direction which I 'm I 'm thinking about going in my quals .  , one is the going towards , using narrow band information for , ph phonetic features of some sort rather than just , immediately going for the the typical sound units . professor c: Another thing I like about it is that you t this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for a product of errors rule , which is what , Allen keeps pointing out that Fletcher observed in the twenties , phd a:   And then , the third thing I like about it is , and we 've played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit but it hasn't been our dominant way of of operating anything , this issue of where the targets come from . So in our case when we 've been training it multi - band things , the way we get the targets for the individual bands is , that we get the phonetic label for the sound there phd a:   professor c: and we say , \" OK , we train every \" What this is saying is , OK , that 's maybe what our ultimate goal is or not ultimate but penultimate goal is getting these these small sound units . But but , along the way how much should we , what should we be training these intermediate things for ?  , because , we don't know  , that this is a particularly good feature .  , there 's no way ,  someone in the audience yesterday was asking , \" well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not ? \" phd a:   professor c: But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide , chunks of speech trying to determine whether I think it 'd be impossible . professor c: It 's all gonna sound like like sine waves to you , more or less . professor c:  Well not  , it 's g all g narrow band  , i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination . It could sh be that you should , not be paying that much attention to , certain bands for certain sounds , in order to get the best result . professor c: So , what we have been doing there , just sort of mixing it all together , is certainly much much cruder than that . Now we have I guess done experiments you 've probably done stuff where you have , done separate , Viterbis on the different grad e: Yeah . Did did that help at all ? grad e: it helps for one or t one iteration but  , anything after that it doesn't help . professor c: So so that may or may t it that aspect of what he 's doing may or may not be helpful because in a sense that 's the same sort of thing . You 're taking global information and determining what you how you should But this is this is , I th I think a little more direct . phd a: How did they measure the performance of their detector ? professor c: And Well , he 's look he 's just actually looking at , the confusions between sonorant and non - sonorant . professor c: So he hasn't applied it to recognition or if he did he didn't talk about it . It 's it 's just And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , the ,  he he did a comparison to , you know , our old foil , the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth . But the one of the good questions in the audience was , well , yeah , but that wasn't trained for that .  , this use of a very smooth , spectral envelope is something that , you know , has evolved as being generally a good thing for speech recognition but if you knew that what you were gonna do is detect sonorants or not So sonorants and non - sonorants is is is almost like voiced - unvoiced , except I guess that the voiced stops are are also called \" obstruents \" .  , so it 's it 's  , but with the exception of the stops I guess it 's pretty much the same as voiced - unvoiced , phd a:   So , if you knew you were doing that , if you were doing something say for a a ,  a a Vocoder , you wouldn't use the same kind of features . Nonetheless , it was one that was interesting because , this is what we are actually using for speech recognition , these smooth envelopes . And this says that perhaps even , you know , trying to use them in the best way that we can , that that that we ordinarily do , with , you know , Gaussian mixtures and H M Ms and so forth , you you don't , actually do that well on determining whether something is sonorant or not . phd a: Didn't they professor c: Which means you 're gonna make errors between similar sounds that are son sonorant or obstruent . phd a: Didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment where they said \" if we could detect the sonorants perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition ? I thought I remember hearing about an experiment like that . professor c: That would that 's you 're right , that 's exactly the question to follow up this discussion , is suppose you did that , got that right . phd b: What could be the other low level detectors , for Other kind of features , or ? in addition to detecting sonorants or ? Th - that 's what you want to to to go for also grad e:  phd b: or ? grad e: What t Oh , build other other detectors on different phonetic features ? phd b: Other low level detectors ? Yeah . e  , w easiest thing would be to go go do some voicing stuff but that 's very similar to sonorance . grad e: phd a: When we when we talked with John Ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that w grad e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah , so there 's a half dozen like that that are grad e: Yeah , nasality . professor c: Now this was coming at it from a different angle but maybe it 's a good way to start .  , these are things which , John felt that a a ,  a human annotator would be able to reliably mark . So the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark would be tongue position kinds of things . professor c: But stress doesn't , fit in this thing of coming up with features that will distinguish words from one another , grad e:   professor c: right ? It 's a it 's a good thing to mark and will probably help us ultimate with recognition phd a: Yeah , there 's a few cases where it can like permit and permit . professor c: Well , yeah , but i either case you 'd write PERMIT , right ? So you 'd get the word right . phd a: No , I 'm saying , i i e I thought you were saying that stress doesn't help you distinguish between words . As long as you get The sequence , professor c: We 're g if we 're doing if we 're talking about transcription as opposed to something else phd a: right ? Yeah . Yeah , so that 's yeah , that 's , you know , a neat neat thing and and ,  So . grad e: S so , Ohala 's going to help do these ,  transcriptions of the meeting data ? phd a: well I don't know .  , we just talked about some possible features that could be marked by humans and , grad e:  . phd a: because of having maybe some extra transcriber time we thought we could go through and mark some portion of the data for that . professor c: that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time . professor c: But but , in the long term I guess Chuck is gonna continue the dialogue with John and and , and , we 'll we 'll end up doing some I think .  , so , y you want to talk maybe a c two or three minutes about what we 've been talking about today and other days ? grad f: Ri Yeah , OK , so , we 're interested in , methods for far mike speech recognition , mainly , methods that deal with the reverberation in the far mike signal . So , one approach would be , say MSG and PLP , like was used in Aurora one and , there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG . And so we 're interested in , comparing the performance of  , a robust approach like MSG with these , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches . grad f: And , it looks like we 're gonna use the Meeting Recorder digits data for that . phd b: And the de - reverberation algorithm , do you have can you give some more details on this or ? Does it use one microphone ? grad f: o o phd b: Several microphones ? Does it ? grad f: OK , well , there was something that was done by , a guy named Carlos , I forget his last name , who worked with Hynek , who , professor c: Avendano . grad f: it was like RASTA in the sense that of it was , de - convolution by filtering  , except he used a longer time window , phd b:   And the reason for that is RASTA 's time window is too short to ,  include the whole , reverberation  , I don't know what you call it the reverberation response . The reverberation filter from my mouth to that mike is like it 's t got it 's too long in the in the time domain for the  for the RASTA filtering to take care of it . And , then there are a couple of other speech enhancement approaches which haven't been tried for speech recognition yet but have just been tried for enhancement , which , have the assumption that  , you can do LPC  analysis of th of the signal you get at the far microphone and the , all pole filter that you get out of that should be good . It 's just the , excitation signal that is going to be distorted by the reverberation and so you can try and reconstruct a better excitation signal and , feed that through the i  , all pole filter and get enhanced speech with reverberation reduced . professor c: There 's also this , echo cancellation stuff that we 've sort of been chasing , so ,  we have ,  and when we 're saying these digits now we do have a close microphone signal and then there 's the distant microphone signal . And you could as a kind of baseline say , \" OK , given that we have both of these , we should be able to do , a cancellation . \" So that , we we , essentially identify the system in between the linear time invariant system between the microphones and and and and re and invert it , or or cancel it out to to some some reasonable approximation phd b: that 's not a practical thing , if you have a distant mike , you don't have a close mike ordinarily , but we thought that might make also might make a good baseline .  , but And then there are s  , there are single microphone methods that I think people have done for ,  for this kind of de - reverberation . Do y do you know any references to any ? Cuz I I w I was w w I I lead him down a a bad path on that . phd b: I g I guess I guess when people are working with single microphones , they are more trying to do professor c: But . phd b: well , not not very Well , there is the Avendano work , professor c: Right . phd b: but also trying to mmm ,  trying to f t find the de - convolution filter but in the  not in the time domain but in the  the stream of features  I guess . Well , @ @ there there 's someone working on this on i in Mons professor c: Yeah , OK . phd b: So perhaps , yeah , we should try t to He 's working on this , on trying to professor c: Yeah . phd b: on re reverberation ,  professor c: The first paper on this is gonna have great references , I can tell already . professor c: It 's always good to have references , especially when reviewers read it or or one of the authors and , feel they 'll \" You 're OK , you 've r You cited me . Well , he did echo cancellation and he did some fancier things like , training different network on different reverberation conditions and then trying to find the best one , but . professor c: The oth the other thing , that Dave was talking about earlier was , multiple mike things , where they 're all distant . So , there 's there 's all this work on arrays , but the other thing is , what can we do that 's cleverer that can take some advantage of only two mikes , particularly if there 's an obstruction between them , as we as we have over there . It 's part of why you have such good directionality with , with two ears phd b:   professor c: So that Yeah , the the head , in the way , is really that 's what it 's for . It 's basically , phd a: That 's what the head 's for ? To separate the ears ? professor c: Yeah , it 's to separate the ears . professor c: Yeah ? phd a: I think th that may be due to the fact that Adam ran out of digits , and didn't have time to regenerate any . professor c: Oh ! Oh ! I guess it 's Well there 's no real reason to write our names on here then , phd a: Yeah , if you want to put your credit card numbers and ,  professor c: is there ? grad e: Oh , no ? professor c: Or do did any do we need the names for the other stuff , phd a: yeah , I do need your names and and the time , and all that , professor c: or ? Oh , OK "

        "Query": "Why was the concept of an intelligent controller proposed by the user interface designer and disapproved by the project manager?",
        "Summary": "The user interface designer proposed incorporating speech recognition and gesture recognition technologies into the controller for convenience and to differentiate it from traditional controllers. However, the project manager raised concerns about the reliability of these features and the potential increase in cost. The designer suggested collaborating with a research institute to address these issues, as the vocabulary would be limited and language adaptations could be made for international users. Despite these solutions, there were still unresolved problems with the necessary microphone and camera for the technologies.",
        "Article": "I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So  here we have our detailed design meeting where we will  look at the prototype and  right so  , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary marketing: project manager: and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go  just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . user interface: project manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So  basically the moral of the story from our last minute  last meeting was that  we that we had meetings from  we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer ,  or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here  and what sort of limitations we're operating with   excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with  voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape  because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .  , and  the   the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . What's to be said about it ?  , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting ,  . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see project manager: This is going to be the on off button project manager: industrial designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels  and then two volume buttons down here , d  we decided those were the most important  buttons . And then , for the more advanced  functions there is a slide out panel here  and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away ,  . As far as the  whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , user interface: marketing: Ah . user interface: industrial designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . user interface: No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about  you know the the interchangeable  faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here marketing:  . user interface: of course that's  interchangeable industrial designer: user interface: and  I think it would be desirable for the  for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued marketing:  'kay . user interface:  and as you can see on the television there  we have the  voice detector device  on the top there .  , what other things do we see here , well ,  if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , project manager: user interface: so I think that will work well with regards to our market .  and  let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available .   do you have anything else to add to that ? industrial designer:  I worried about the materials , it is  the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable  , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .  , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . user interface: It's actually important to note that the television ,  you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the  the company's name on the telephone screen , project manager: Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok industrial designer: I thought that was kinda nice . marketing: project manager: industrial designer: This user interface: marketing: Do we need to worry about  rot factors ? project manager: user interface:  it's encased in a new  type of  marketing: Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: we don't need to worry , industrial designer: We got a bit ahead of ourselves , user interface: It's fine . industrial designer: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but user interface:  . user interface: but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , project manager: Brilliant . user interface:  I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that  whether we need to worry about any  other marketing areas or anything of that nature . This cost well to put this into  production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro  and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . industrial designer: One thing that we didn't do  obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and  since we did that marketing:  . industrial designer: we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . industrial designer: So even though it has a lot of modern technology ,  for example the voice recognition , marketing:  . industrial designer: in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and  I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers  we might be able to get even cheaper . Did we talk about the voice recognition  option ? industrial designer: And Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? user interface: So  so  yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition   console project manager: marketing: Okay . user interface: but basically the voice recognition  incorporates  the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw  come up with . industrial designer: Any questions ? project manager: No , no marketing: Do we have  other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? project manager: I think that's user interface: marketing: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? industrial designer: do you wanna answer this one marketing: Do we know where we stand on that yet ? industrial designer: or do you want me to answer it ? user interface: Well we didn't quite have enough material  . user interface: Oh I see , marketing: I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet . industrial designer: well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and  it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like marketing: Okay . marketing: And the whole thing project manager: marketing: Okay user interface: So  there are I marketing: Right user interface: we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look  materials marketing: Yeah . We also continued on with the ideas that f following  Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the  light orange and the green . industrial designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough marketing: Okay . industrial designer: that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way marketing: Okay .  , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it ,  I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . project manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's a solar cell thing right ? industrial designer: Right project manager: With a back-up battery ? industrial designer:  we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , project manager: With the ba okay .  so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a  It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah .  and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that be the general industrial designer: Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say . Push button interface  with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? industrial designer: Yeah , And  a special I guess it's  we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , industrial designer: Yeah , special . industrial designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , project manager: Yeah , it's it's quite unique . project manager: I like it , yeah it's So it looks like marketing: M come in at sixteen ? project manager: a bit over budget ,  . Huh , doesn't match up does it ? user interface: marketing: project manager: So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells  or take out the back-up battery .  industrial designer: How do you feel about that ? user interface:  I think that  if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . industrial designer:  we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working user interface: project manager: industrial designer: it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the  to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , marketing: Nah . project manager: it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way .  if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it ,  user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental  obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . user interface:  you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing marketing:  user interface:  that's what sets us apart marketing: Which , it's user interface: right ? marketing: yeah that's what setting us into this young market ,  that's where we started from , so I don't know , and  you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . user interface: And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the  the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here marketing: Right . user interface: and  you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here project manager: It's either or . industrial designer: It's the only way we're gonna get below our  goal isn't it ? Of twelve fifty . project manager: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're industrial designer: Yeah , . marketing: It kind of project manager:  and we can't get rid of the   removing the user interface: Savings . project manager: changing the case wouldn't be so much of a - , nor would changing the case materials .  , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . project manager: That'd be great industrial designer: user interface: marketing: I didn't even do that one on purpose either , user interface: marketing: damn . Okay , basically I was just evaluating  from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important .  so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ?  . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . marketing: the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface ,  that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . It looks like it's going over well , so user interface: And the paging function works well , industrial designer: Six ? user interface: that's good to hear , marketing: we're we're good yeah . It's I think eventually if we do  branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into  wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good . industrial designer: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel marketing: That's everything from me . marketing: Yeah , it is a set-back , but industrial designer: marketing: Okay , do you need the cord back ? project manager:  yeah , user interface: W we might have  we might have lost that granola market again project manager: I was just go on . user interface: that we're project manager: Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ? industrial designer: True .  so I guess we are going to discuss  our project process  marketing: industrial designer: user interface: project manager: and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go   out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess ,  . industrial designer: Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or marketing: Okay . marketing: It is now , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: you're in charge there you go . so user interface: project manager: But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . project manager:  right ,  so any thoughts ? industrial designer: Are we considering these points here ? marketing:  . project manager: What do you guys feel about the process ? industrial designer: marketing: you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , project manager: and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . We could now if that'd make up for it user interface: And marketing: but really industrial designer: marketing: and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . user interface: also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . marketing: Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual industrial designer: Yeah , it's true . project manager: marketing: Yeah , but I didn't get a response industrial designer: What if you get a response two or three months from now ? user interface: marketing: so project manager: marketing: we'll see . industrial designer: marketing: Well user interface: industrial designer: marketing: what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: I so n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , I don't we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us ,  . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: marketing: And highly resourceful team mates might I add industrial designer: project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: industrial designer: I guess user interface: industrial designer: My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , project manager: user interface: marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . industrial designer: At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , project manager: marketing: Do your own . marketing: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . marketing:  maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . marketing: Nothing , I didn't even get an email , user interface: marketing: like industrial designer: marketing: that was it . So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . user interface: Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to marketing: Whatever . user interface: well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing industrial designer:  . industrial designer: You know user interface:  and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was marketing:  . user interface: but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , industrial designer: Yeah . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you user interface: which was fine . industrial designer: 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . project manager: She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it . That's kind of a good thing though , project manager: I felt like I slipped into it a lot . user interface: An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? project manager: The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . project manager: it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , user interface: project manager: you know ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: marketing: and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , industrial designer: user interface: I had to admit , as soon as w we started  as soon as we got the Play-Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . industrial designer: project manager: Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , user interface: Possibly . project manager: like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos user interface: Oh yeah , marketing: Yeah . project manager:  you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: I think so . user interface: project manager: No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , industrial designer: You don't . project manager: I don't I I was just I marketing: Though we didn't actually  other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It's true huh ? marketing: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . user interface: I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like  . industrial designer: project manager: It d marketing: Yeah that is kind of project manager: But yeah . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ?  the whole process of industrial designer: Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? project manager: I don't know . I I don't know if there was a ri I th marketing: Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , industrial designer: Yeah , that's it marketing: I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . industrial designer: 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , project manager: Nor I . marketing:  I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't . user interface:  it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . project manager: I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized marketing: I know . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because user interface: marketing: I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . user interface: So is this all we need to get through ? project manager: I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . user interface: Is it marketing: It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? project manager: Well , that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , marketing: That slide was like that ? project manager: user interface: Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? project manager: W I kinda like th industrial designer: No , none . user interface: project manager: Yeah you can't industrial designer: I think they're fine actually . marketing: I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form project manager: Yeah . project manager: Does kinda make you wonder , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , you can marketing: It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , project manager: Yeah . user interface: What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ? project manager: So this was other costs . I think this is marketing: Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? project manager: forty ish marketing: How much time do we have left ? project manager: I I I  we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval ,  . project manager: you know what is marketing: Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work project manager: Yep . marketing: and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway user interface: Why ? project manager: Hey . marketing: like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . industrial designer: Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . user interface: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation industrial designer: Yeah . I di user interface: Oh I added like five slides too , marketing: See project manager: Oh . industrial designer: I just got blank ones project manager: What ? Really ? industrial designer: and marketing: My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe user interface: Yeah , mine too . project manager: yeah they didn't come like this ? Like with this was what it looks like . This is what that looked like , marketing: Like with those words already on it ? project manager: literally , just like that . user interface: I added many slides every time marketing: Hey industrial designer: marketing: with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . project manager: industrial designer: I think it would fail , I think marketing: I can't just leave it there . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . marketing: I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . user interface: Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to  fr some other design  modifications . user interface: I hope you appreciate the  incorporation of some tin foil from a  random Kit-Kat bar project manager: marketing: I I noticed that . industrial designer: Yeah , it's  user interface: So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . You know from the the the basics to the conce industrial designer: I wanna see a marketing: I Yeah . project manager: although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . project manager: yeah  i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . project manager: maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea . industrial designer: So we have more slides or ? marketing: project manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it marketing: We got it to be . project manager: We did the project evaluation based on  Sarah's evaluation of on off switches marketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of , project manager: and marketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . marketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us . project manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . marketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that project manager: Oh yeah . project manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . user interface: What the uhs and the marketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . industrial designer: Filler words or ? project manager: Yep , they're called  disfluencies . industrial designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , so  I do the marketing: Yeah , we are addicts . user interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are project manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . project manager: No we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know  ubiquitous marketing: I yeah . marketing: But it's not regular  my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still . user interface: In the eighties ? marketing: My  grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had  an E_D_U_ and gov network . marketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't  household to household yet user interface: Right . marketing: because it hadn't been user interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something . project manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: Where do you find that ? marketing: I have no idea . user interface: industrial designer: Is that the only song you have ? user interface: There is another one . project manager: Is this one of those media player ? industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Huh ? project manager: W oh . project manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it  shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . marketing: So is that a close ? project manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner "

        "Query": "What are the future prospects for data collection?",
        "Summary": "In the second phase of data collection, the group plans to use more complex scenarios to generate intricate dialogues. To ensure an adequate number of participants, subjects will be recruited from within the Psychology department, as their participation in experiments is mandatory. The group's goal is to collect over 100 hours of Meeting Recorder data, and they are currently revising the speaker consent forms. It has been proposed that subjects should sign a new consent form after every 10 recording sessions.",
        "Article": "professor a: We 're not recording yet , are we ? grad g: Well , I don't think phd f: No , that that wasn't recorded . phd f: I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something . phd f: I was just noticing a big s professor d: So are we recording now ? Is this phd e: Yeah . professor d: So , what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ? grad g: I think that phd e: It 's a good idea . grad g: u usually we 've done that and also we 've s done digits as well , but I forgot to print any out . Besides with this big a group , phd b: You can write them on the board , if you want . I it 'd be even better with this big grad g: it would take too much time . phd e: Mari ? postdoc h: What professor a: What ? professor d: It 's not that long . professor d: w u phd e: So that thing the little th that part should be pointing upwards . professor a: It 's kind of professor d: Oh , yeah , the element , yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection , and , you you put up there data format , professor a:  . professor d: and other tasks during data collection , professor a: So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get professor d: and professor a: what can you add to it to get , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like grad g: especially for querying . postdoc h: Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , i  , if he I ,  if he has s I I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? grad g: Landay . postdoc h: La - Landay ? So he has , these , tsk note - taking things , professor a:   postdoc h: then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . professor a: Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or  , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . grad g: But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , postdoc h:   And so , you know phd f: the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up professor a: So grad g: pretty easily . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things . So , if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . professor d: I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . professor a: But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? professor d: No , not a No , I just My mind went elsewhere . So , yeah , I 'm Morgan , and where am I ? I 'm on channel three . postdoc h: Should we have used pseudo - names ? Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . professor d: I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel phd e: Let me , turn that off . grad g: And , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z phd e: Oh . phd e: PDM - right , PZA - right PDA - right , PDA - left . grad g: Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . postdoc h: I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say \" Jimlet \" and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? You know , the Jimlet  , the box that contains the professor d: Well , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know . professor d: we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?  , do we have s people write summaries ? Everybody or one person ? And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? Is that phd f: There 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? professor a: Right . phd f: that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . phd f: But there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . professor d: There 's there 's another problem grad g: And professor d: which is , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . And , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group and and , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , \" OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , the summar \" grad g: Well , I asked them to and none of them did . grad g: So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting postdoc h:   grad g: So I didn't track them down and say \" please do th do it now \" . professor d: I I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , professor a: Right . professor d: as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . grad g: I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say \" that 's important , that might be a query \" . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , there are certain key words like , you know , \" action item \" and things like that , which could be used in , t to some degree finding the structure . phd e: Although professor a: W postdoc h: And and I also , was thinking , with reference to the n  , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , I think they should be recorded instead of written because I think that , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . professor a: How about this idea ? That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . professor a: And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? postdoc h: Yeah . grad g: that gives you a summary but it doesn't really How do you generate queries from that ? phd e: Well . But , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . phd b: Actually And so grad g: James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me . professor d: Well , I think that we  , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings professor a: Well professor d: and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed grad g: Yep . professor d: And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and at the very least . So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . phd b: you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . phd b: It may not be kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important . phd b: And that wouldn't take any extra postdoc h: That 's a nice idea . phd b: Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad professor d: It professor c:   It 's professor d: That 's a good idea but that doesn't Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? professor a: Well , what it does phd b: Well , then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . phd b: And grad g: y professor a: I I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se , but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say \" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? \" phd b: Yeah . professor d: That that 's what  , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , \" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? \" , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . phd e: Well , see , there are th professor a: I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , when  , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . phd b: At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords professor d: Maybe . grad g: i this would tell you what the hit is , phd b: and grad g: not what the query is . grad g: And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , professor a: Right . grad g: but phd b: We don't even know what  , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user , professor d:   professor d: Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that phd b:  . professor d: because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in in i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of of of queries . So he 's just sort of going \" where where do I where do I start ? \" professor a: w Well , th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there , professor d: OK . One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . professor a: So \" action item \" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . professor a: the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying \" here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? \" grad g: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . professor a: Well grad g: But , I think it would give professor a: That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , grad g:   So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . phd e: But th there is this ,  There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think \" oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? \" And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you professor a:   phd e: And that 's kind of what this kind of , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . phd e: Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . So ,  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur . phd e: But  , it 's difficult to sort of say \" and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? \" Those aren't the kind of things that come up . postdoc h: I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , \" we discussed types of na data collection \" . If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it even if you don't have a direct route to that . postdoc h: I think that grad g: That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . phd b: No , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker grad g: But they phd b: And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , and they can use it for their research .  , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , grad g:   But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , professor d:   Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it . grad g: And so the question is \" is there such a person ? \" And I think right now , the answer is \" no \" . professor a: Well professor d: I 've b been thinking grad g: We 'll just have to see . professor d: I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the  , th this , e  I think that the now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , is actually a reasonable , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at . It 's it 's not ideal , but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . So I was I was just thinking about , suppose we wanted to get w We have this collection of meeting . So now we have five hours of meetings and , you ask me , \" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? \"  , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go \" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , I remember that , what was the part that \" And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , professor d:   professor a:  phd b: So how does the summary get generated ? professor a: Well , i i ? phd b: I 'm not against the idea of a summary , grad g: By hand . phd b: but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it professor a: Or , d o phd b: and how because the summary will drive the queries . professor a: What I I think , you know , in most meetings , phd b: So professor a: this one being different , but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  , you can just make it be on a laptop , phd b:   professor a: so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . postdoc h: I I I think that , there 's we 're using \" summary \" in two different ways . postdoc h: And what I originally thought was , if you asked someone \" what was the meeting about ? \" phd b: OK . postdoc h: And then they would say \" well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about \" And then you 'd have , like I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that professor a:   postdoc h: Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , with mult See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . And , you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , professor d:   professor d: A postdoc h: So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , professor a: OK . postdoc h: no longer than two minutes , professor d: Adam , you can postdoc h: from multiple people . professor d: but but , my impression was that , pretty much , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w  , with a laptop grad g: Never . Does anyone ? phd b: Dan ? professor d: I grad g: Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , phd e: Yeah . Most of the meetings we have are four or five people grad g: That 's true are four or five people . professor d: and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . professor a: So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . grad g: The IRAM meeting , they they take notes every professor d: Do they ? grad g: There 's  a person with a laptop at each meeting . phd b: I don't know how , but for instance , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . phd e: We sh we should grad g: I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , postdoc h: I agree . phd e: f u I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera grad g: Yeah , different phd b: y phd e: just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . grad g: But don't you think that 's Don't you think that But postdoc h: I agree .  , I I just think  , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . phd e: Not not as part of the not as a part of the data that you have to recover . phd e: Just just in terms of phd b: We should just Like archiving it or storing it . postdoc h: It 's i because discourse is about things , phd b: Because someone postdoc h: and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . phd b: someone later might be able to take these and say \" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there phd e: So phd b: and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and \" and just postdoc h: Yes . professor d: Li postdoc h: Like you said , three snapshots professor d: L L L postdoc h: and professor d: Liz , you postdoc h: Just to archive . professor d: u  , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , subcommittee meeting or whatever phd e: Actually professor d: on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the ,  that workshop we were at that , Mark Liberman was was having . They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect professor d:   phd b: And professor d: I think you  , that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing . professor d: And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . professor d: So ,  grad g: But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . So we 're gonna So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us . phd b: I think even doing something very crude professor d: But having phd b: Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . phd b: And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . So if you can find some really , you know , low , perplexity , grad g: Low fidelity . And if it 's simple as  , as simple as just the digital phd b: Otherwise you 'd you lose it . professor d: Well , minimally , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so ,  grad g: Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier professor d: Yeah . grad g: But phd b: Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time professor d:   phd b: and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room . So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded . grad g: So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say \" I won't participate \" . phd b: Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head grad g:  phd b: and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting talking . phd b: That would be an interes Bu postdoc h: Well professor d: Great idea . But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards , phd b: Yeah . postdoc h: sp spatial organization And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , this is grad g: But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work . postdoc h: We can talk about the grad g: To set it up and then anonymize it ? postdoc h: It 's just one snapshot . phd b: No , it wa n not ,  professor a: No , no , no , no . Maybe we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it , phd f: Did they store it digitally , or ? postdoc h: but phd b:   I think they just phd f: or just put it on videotape ? phd b: I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Well , I think for  , for our purposes we probably will d phd b: I 'm not sure . professor d: we we might try that some and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think . postdoc h: Th The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And phd b: I 'm just The community If LDC collects this data u  , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there . phd b: And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , easier made easier if you had the video . professor d: I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . professor d: As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , and and will include all that . professor d: professor a: e professor d: I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , subsets of that . Like for a meeting like this , at least , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , phd b: Of the board . phd b: Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board . professor d: a and know the position of the people phd b: That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . phd b: otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .  , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . grad g: except in postdoc h: s grad g: er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost .  , I just think that the grad g: The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . postdoc h: Well professor a: What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , is in the record . postdoc h: Well professor a: Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  , we  , we don't need to require it . professor a: so so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . professor d: So So , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody from from today ? OK . professor d: So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . professor d: And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries and are we gonna do anything about that . professor a: So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? professor d: Yeah . professor a: So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna n I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . professor d: I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . professor d: So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . professor d: So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero , professor a: Nothing . professor d: and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou professor a: OK . phd b: I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . grad g: And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well . So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . I think it it it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . grad g: but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . professor d: I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another . That if if people have something in front of them phd b: I 'd be sort of cool . So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? grad g: Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . professor d: So who who does this summarization ? postdoc h: Yeah , I 'm thinking that grad g: People in the meeting . grad g: You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go , postdoc h:  - huh . phd e: People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . phd b: Well , then you should try them a few weeks later postdoc h: How fascinating . phd b: and They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain grad g: And see score them ? phd e: That 's right . phd b: and wasn't phd e: If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . professor a: But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , professor d: Ru grad g: I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . professor a: because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . grad g: Maybe e Is email easier ? postdoc h: Well , I think if grad g: I when you first said do do it , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up postdoc h:   postdoc h: Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . But , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay . professor a: But , you know , if you get even one postdoc h: w professor d: Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , postdoc h: I would s Yeah . professor d: that that y that you can't certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . postdoc h: And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be  , phd e: Yeah . postdoc h: Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed , phd e: Right . postdoc h: just phd f: So I have a question about queries , grad g: God , that 's bugging me . phd f: which is , grad g: Can we turn that light off ? postdoc h: You turn phd f:  grad g: If can we turn that just that that let professor d: The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . grad g: Yeah , there 's a phd b: Oh , it is it is like OK . professor a: That and y Too much caffeine and really tired , grad g: Too much caffeine . phd f: the question I had about queries was , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are are we gonna try and o grad g: We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? phd f: Yeah . phd f: so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?  , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , professor d: Mmm . phd f: n phd b: Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? professor d: Yeah . phd b: They 're the expert phd e: Mari ? professor a: Yeah ? phd e: Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ? professor a: what 's our schedule ? professor d: Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . professor a: Let 's see , you and I need dis  , no , we did the Liz talk . professor a: We need to finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So , grad g: And what ? professor a:  professor d: I 'm at your disposal . professor a: what what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should professor d: I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? grad g: At least . professor a: So , I think phd b: It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free professor d: Well , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . professor d: And professor a: e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't phd e: OK , five - thirty . grad g: Well , in answer to \" is it Landay 's problem ? \" , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . professor d: Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I I actually think that that , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .  , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and ,  phd b: But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . phd f: Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . phd f: Right ? Of how to how to generate queries from a phd b: How to do this from the summary . phd b: So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . phd b: and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or or a deeper Yeah . phd b: You postdoc h: I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be \" what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? \" Becau - in terms of like informativeness , phd b: That 's a good one . postdoc h: it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . professor a: But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . postdoc h: Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . postdoc h: So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary . But with the \" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? \"  , so the fact that , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting phd b: Going to see the kids . So , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings professor a:   professor c: Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? grad g: As many are willing to do it . Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? professor c: and then Yeah . phd e: So grad g: Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done  , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . professor a: But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , grad g: Mmm . postdoc h: And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the some some of the little things that would be hidden . professor d: Boy , I I don't know how we get at this postdoc h: That would be interesting . professor c: Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something grad g: Or want to get up and leave . professor c: and then you go around the room and they say \" yeah , me too , I agree . professor c: So phd e: On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? professor d: Well phd e: They might say \" oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else \" . grad g: Well , you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll  , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say .  , It seemed The kind of , interest that I had in this thing initially was , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , professor a:   So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else professor a: Right . professor d: in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now You weren't interested Say I I said \" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person \" . professor d: But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm \" well what is what was that part that that that , Mari was saying ? \" grad g: Yeah , like Jim Bass says \" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf \" professor a:  professor d: Yeah . professor d: And then I 'm trying to fi  , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . professor a: Well , I That 's hard to generate professor d: So , I don't I don't know . phd f: Do we professor a: and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times  , make you know , think to myself \" this is interesting , professor d:   professor a: So , things that I think are interesting , I would be , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . That that might get at some of what I was I was concerned about , being interested in something later that w  , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up . grad g: But But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . grad g: Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it , professor d: Yeah . phd f: The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? professor d:   But postdoc h: Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying \" important \" and we 're saying \" interesting \" . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that  , postdoc h:   professor d: W phd f: does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? professor d: Well , irreversible . phd f: That 's that 's professor d: I I  , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and ,  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . If you know , if  , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that . postdoc h: I will say that that I I chose \" interesting \" because I think it includes also \" important \" in some cases . postdoc h: Well , and and also i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate . You know , I think inter \" interesting \" is is non - threatening in professor a: OK - OK . professor a: In the interest of , grad g: Importance ? postdoc h: Yeah . professor a: No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , and also moving on to action items and other things , let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , that we at least decided on . CrossPads we were going to try , if Landay can get the ,  get them to to you guys , and see if they 're interesting . professor a: getting just , digital pictures a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .  , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , postdoc h: k professor a: and that way you 'll get more variety . \" And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . professor a: OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? That well , that we want to do ? postdoc h:   grad g: Yeah , that 's like n I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then . postdoc h: And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . phd e: there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . phd e: And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . grad g: Give them a reward , a dollar a query ? phd e: Yeah , really . So professor d: Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then  , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to postdoc h: Yeah .  , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? grad g: Well , we 're gonna phd b: So you need to have some sort of if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha phd e:  . phd b: In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . phd b: It But it may well grad g: But professor d: Because  , b because it depends on , what our goal is . grad g: Really ? professor d: If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . professor d: And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , phd e: Yeah . grad g: Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings . phd e: Well just imagine if professor d: But but just phd e: Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , professor d: Yeah . w Just \" what would you like to know ? \" phd e: but grad g: Yep . postdoc h: I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like \" action item \" , professor a: OK . postdoc h: Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , phd b: Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you . phd b: So , in general , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to do this . Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , \" other than your action item \" , you know , whatever . phd e: Well postdoc h: But but the action item would be a way to get , maybe an additional query . Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ professor a: Well , we 're piloting . professor a: or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav professor d: We we had  , phd e: Yeah . professor d: somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , from the description things ? professor a: I got Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . professor d: And , you know , there 's obviously detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , requirements . professor a: people are supposed to send me U R for their for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . We professor a:  ? phd e: we need to look at our web page professor a: And and you also need to look at your web page phd e: and make one that 's that 's p professor a: and clean it up by mid - July . And so ,  professor a: How about if I just c  , Right now all I want I personally only want text data . I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . professor d: Wh postdoc h: You could email to both of us , just  , if you wanted to . postdoc h: I don't think either of us would mind recei professor a: OK . postdoc h: but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the professor a: And your email is ? professor d: i postdoc h: Edwards at ICSI . professor a: And then professor d: In in our phone call , before , we we ,  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , And ,  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service , that will grad g: Oh , is this IBM ? professor d: Yeah . postdoc h: Yeah , using foot pedals professor d: Yeah , foot foot pedals postdoc h: and professor d: and grad g: so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? professor d: See , that 's a good question . professor d: probably about like you did , grad g: Mix ? professor d: and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well . And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll they 'll ,  they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . professor d: We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff grad g: So we 'll give them all sixteen channels professor d: and grad g: and they 'll do whatever they want with it . phd b: But you also should probably give them the mixed You know , equal sound - level professor d: Yeah . professor d: It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . phd f: But w phd b: I phd f: It 's not professor a: Right . phd b: You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did . I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , the on - line , data that Adam set up , The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up postdoc h: Good . grad g: And then p possibly postdoc h: I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . grad g: Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . We were gonna grad g: Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . professor a: That 's postdoc h: Well ,  professor a: W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work phd e: Well  , yeah . So , what n important thing professor a: but Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , postdoc h: Well , it c phd e: Right . professor d: So a key thing will be that you we tell you postdoc h: Great . phd f: and \" professor d: We also had the ,  that we were s  , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number professor a: Oh , yeah . professor d: and we 're all gonna we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , depending on how you define it , users . professor c: Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users . Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , professor a: Yeah . Or , like if you have a professor c: who know that you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . professor a: Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you , professor c: So . e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . professor d: My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it grad g: He would never use it . So I have the professor d: We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , w e e e they 're you know , they 're p m If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , major communications between Dan and UW folks phd e: Yeah .  , professor a: I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August . professor d: as to phd e: we should talk about it , but postdoc h: Mmm . professor a: So , you know , if professor d: But we have it it 's it 's pretty We don't know .  , he he s  , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust professor a: We don't know . professor d: and and so we don't know , professor a: i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , professor d: i e professor a: but a at least it 's worth trying .  , and I will email these notes  , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . professor d: and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have grad g:   professor a: Oh ! professor d: some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . phd e: Yeah , that was  , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . But it 's p it might be phd e: so professor a: But but that 's actually what I wanna do . grad g: Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . If I don't get something grad g: Who ? Landay or Jason ? professor a: Landay . professor a: you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers or I could I could use ,  I could use your web pages . You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor professor d: Yeah , why search for them ? professor a: Yeah ! professor d: They 're we know where they are . professor d: There 's there 's some , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On on meeting recording , grad g: Yep . professor a: So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox , professor d: and phd b: And there 's You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , professor d: And Xerox . phd b: smart rooms , grad g: the \" Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand \" is a good one . J There 's th That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , professor a:   phd b: because of all these classroom grad g: Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of . postdoc h: Can I ask , one thing ? It relates to data data collection and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  , so , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , are lessened . But I wonder if  , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , u w we would c  , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever . postdoc h: Now , you know , it 's true , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . phd f: Adam ! postdoc h: But , i i  , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? professor d:  . phd e: turn off professor a: I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , postdoc h: OK . Just want to be sure there 's enough data to professor a: phd b: They 're still gonna overlap , postdoc h: OK , good . phd b: but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . professor d: Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . postdoc h: because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . postdoc h: Not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired . But if if that 's sufficient data I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people postdoc h: Time . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . professor a: Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . Well , I just as as as a contributary eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know you know , \" wait till each person is finished before you say something \" . professor a: Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , unintrusive as possi postdoc h:   I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u  , you know , as much data as we can . Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ? phd b:   professor d: What phd b: And there was a big division , professor d: What what do they phd b: so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . phd b: So there 's lots of recordings that They 're not close - talk mike , professor d: Yeah . phd b: but And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings .  , and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , professor d:   Is that is that going to be publicly available , phd b: As far as I know , they h have not . grad g: It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? phd b: I 'm not sure .  , if people were interested they could talk to them , but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved . grad g: Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field , phd b: I think you need to talk to Waibel and grad g: intelligent - room sorts of things . phd b: But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . Well , once we send out postdoc h: Yeah , I think professor d: we still haven't sent out the first note saying \" hey , this list exists \" . But but , once we do that professor a: Is that an action item ? professor d: Yeah . We should at least check that everybody here ? grad g: I think everyone here is on the list . grad g: I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me . grad g: You are on it , aren't you ? postdoc h: Yeah , I am . So \" found data \" , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ? phd b: What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect , postdoc h: It sounds like such a t phd b: and especially good postdoc h: Yeah , OK . It 's things occur without any You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . Of course it 's not \" found \" in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . phd b: But what he means is that You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , postdoc h: That 's interesting . phd e: We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? professor a: Oh . phd b: Rrrh ! grad g: Now , I was already thinking about it , so professor d: Oh ! Good man . phd b: I grad g: So , I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that . postdoc h: Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , I I found this discussion very , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought was worthwhile . grad g: Did you take pictures of the boards ? phd e: Not that I postdoc h: Yeah .  , I will take pictures of them , but postdoc h: That 's a good point . phd f: I 'm gonna pass because I can't  , of the Jane took my answer . But I will say  , I will actually  , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , in this project . professor d: Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . phd e: How are we gonna find that in the data ? grad g: Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time phd e: Oh , yeah . grad g: Yeah , I think phd f: Well , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . phd e: How happy were they ? professor d: I 'd probably search for something like that . postdoc h:  h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ? professor d: Now these we turn off "

        "Summary": "The remote control should not only be small, easy to use, and eye-catching, but also have buttons with a soft feel and a trendy design, possibly incorporating fruit and vegetable elements. Marketing suggested incorporating one or two star features, such as speech recognition, to build the campaign around. The energy source for the remote should be a battery, and it was emphasized that the remote should be brought to the market before the competition. Marketing emphasized the importance of adopting the latest trends and fashion updates for the remote control, particularly for the targeted young users. This includes features like an LCD screen, vivid colors, and a cool shape. However, it was noted that the decisions made regarding the interface did not align with the desired look and feel. The team discussed the possibility of incorporating Bluetooth functionality, but ultimately decided against it. They also explored the idea of using squeezable rubber as an energy generator. Easy usability was another key point raised by Marketing, who suggested incorporating fruit-shaped buttons to align with the upcoming fashion trend. The Project Manager proposed marketing the control in different colors for different groups of people, similar to the iPod. During the evaluation process, Marketing expressed dissent regarding the financial aspects of the design, highlighting the need for further adjustments during budget control. The lack of information about prices led to unrealistic discussions about costly functions like recognition. Marketing believed that users would be interested in a speech recognizer to simplify program selection and reduce the number of buttons. The remote control should also be small and affordable. The team briefly considered lighting adapting options but ultimately left the decision to the Industrial Designer and User Interface designer. The team also discussed potential user-friendly features, including tracking devices to recognize personal preferences and a voice activator to help locate the remote. However, due to budget constraints, these ideas were set aside. The Industrial Designer mentioned the importance of considering repetitive strain injury (RSI) in the ergonomic design process and suggested using touch buttons instead of press buttons to mitigate this issue.",
        "Article": "marketing: What's the agenda for this meeting ? project manager: The I will  present here agenda with with with with slides to you . I've also made notes of the previous meeting and  I was about to send them you but then  I had to go to this  meeting so you will get them too  marketing: project manager: Then I hope you all have  worked out some some  some some presentations about  about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .  then I will  bring in some some some new requirements I I got  from the  account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . project manager: and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the marketing:  . industrial designer: You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? project manager: Yes  well yes w who are we going to  to well to sell this , marketing:  . So And then  we will close this meeting  user interface: project manager: and after this meeting we'll  we'll have a lunch . Maybe  why  Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? marketing: No , I don't . project manager:  you want a table to to  marketing: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . project manager: Yes yes maybe maybe you can  can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary  . Well I've just been  presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . It's probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it .  seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . project manager: Do you Do you have this  information on the web page you said ? marketing: I have an a web page yes . So basically  there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control .  , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times  and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Teletext is used  fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . marketing: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that  fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . industrial designer: marketing: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . industrial designer: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's marketing: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . industrial designer: Not enough marketing: I don't know how we'd go about combating that . What do you mean there ? marketing: For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury . project manager: But it's it's the opinion of the  of the users huh ? marketing: Yeah . marketing:  and then it's got a demographic breakdown on industrial designer: Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the marketing:  I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . user interface: You can disconnect it there project manager: You can maybe just just user interface: no ? marketing: Oh no , yeah . industrial designer: Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional  user interface: Oh yeah . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . industrial designer: Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the  both yeah user interface and functional design . marketing: One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute . industrial designer: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint  our design based on what is more important . industrial designer: Speech recognition in marketing: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . industrial designer: So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control marketing: Well potentially yeah ,  project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it would be all based on speech . project manager: Well it would it would be a solution for  when your remote control is lost , marketing: project manager:  when it has speech recognition then  i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . industrial designer: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? user interface: Oh . Well , it depends you know like there is  it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , project manager:  . project manager: Yes , user interface: It's it's going to be li project manager: that that that that's  . user interface: it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case project manager: Do you have some more important facts user interface: but it's but I don't know with twenty fi marketing:  project manager: or can we go to the next presentation ? industrial designer: Okay . So marketing: Well industrial designer: you had to to to summarise maybe the marketing: This is now talking about  who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it ,  . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five ,  twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . marketing: Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , user interface: project manager:  . industrial designer: I thi You us marketing: It'll be in a different window , yep . marketing: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .  I okay project manager: Oh , industrial designer: I stay project manager: this is user interface: Now you can move I think yeah . user interface: It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , marketing: Sorry ? Oh .  I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very  technical background  what is it because I think in the product it is important . industrial designer: So basically  the basic function of a remote control is to send  messages to another system that is fixed . industrial designer: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually  through a  infrared bit marketing: So my method for  designing the yeah the work design  yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional  capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . industrial designer: So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing  Expert  Anna marketing: industrial designer: and  w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions  for this remote control and I show you the the working design .  we want an on off button , it can be  it's simple but it's it's important , and also  the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , marketing:  . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is  will be to well my aim would be to  design the and choose the chips and the infrared  components to build the remote control marketing: This is very quick  design ,  you stop me or interrupt me if  you don't agree on it on that . industrial designer: And  so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this  schema marketing: Well . industrial designer: that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me marketing: You drew it a long time ago ? industrial designer: you know . industrial designer: And  that's it so I won't go into details about that project manager: overwhelming . So project manager: are they cheap , or are they  reliable ? What were your industrial designer: found and yeah th you have always a compromise with  reliability and  i if it's expensive , project manager:  . industrial designer: but  this one was not this one also really  reliable  so yeah that's it for the working design ,  I hope you get clearer view on  what what a remote control is  in terms of  technical components project manager: Yes . industrial designer: but maybe yeah project manager: So user interface: But is it  can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma industrial designer: No no no no we we will  This is a preference but we can always change  project manager: What I w what I was thinking about  the the the schema  about  the sender and the receiver ,  can you can you get back to it ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah  , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not  able to change it . We will use  infrared protocol  using yeah infrared and  and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists project manager: industrial designer: and but we what we can do is   adapting the the chips inside  to the best  chips and  infrared bubbles . Of course yeah user interface: But you should be careful , industrial designer: in the chip you have it yeah . user interface: people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote    which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . user interface: So maybe we should think of marketing: industrial designer: Of course yeah we should take that into account marketing: That's handy . project manager: Yeah yes marketing: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . industrial designer: in the  user interface: Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away industrial designer: user interface: You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . project manager: I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this  th these things . So  I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , marketing: user interface: so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that  basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have  keys or buttons with which people can  press and then  changing a button will basically  change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and   industrial designer: So p as  Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is  s a question which will we have to see later . user interface: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . user interface: And  so generally  I don't have some figures sorry but  so there are two kinds of  remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play ,  volume change and  keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now   even the one  on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but   . Then there is  this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing ,  which which you can vouch . And then you have  what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop  and then you play the movie or  or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those marketing: And then well personal preferences I would  basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the  the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because  some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that  we could  aim for the like in the f coming future  that type of  applications with marketing: Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , user interface: marketing: so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , user interface: Yeah . marketing: so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: or does it know which one you want to use ? user interface:  actually  you could you could think of  having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing marketing: user interface: but   yo you you you still can't  in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option marketing: user interface: and you could play it or You can also think about having like  I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate  sitting setup box marketing: user interface: and  you have   something like   you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you marketing: user interface: and  you can just you know  when you come back you could just switch on that thing and  watch a program . user interface: In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . user interface: It's the next generation thing , project manager:  yes , user interface: but it is going to come in couple of years . project manager: but I think it's i i it's already there , user interface: It's goi project manager:  the hard disk  recorders  I I've seen them in the shop . user interface: it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both   video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . That's , user interface: No no we are not making a universal remote , marketing: yeah . user interface: we are just looking at  giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box marketing:  . user interface: which is going to sit there and  it's going to do that job for me . Because y project manager: W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . project manager: Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible  future p  prospects marketing:  . So we can always discuss about it for example  the presently the video market actually  this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually industrial designer: user interface: so it i like people are providing like  things like   movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and  your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . user interface: and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . industrial designer: Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed  online  yeah . user interface: Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie marketing:  . project manager: I have  received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and  I would like to share them with you . project manager: first thing is  teletext is a well known feature of televisions marketing: Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent  prominent  place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . project manager:  as  a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . project manager: further yes we must think ,  do we stay  to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back  huh , or do we   go further as Matthew indicated by supporting   recording  devices ? user interface: marketing: So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? project manager:  indeed indeed .  , furthermore , w we need really need to interest  y younger customers and then with younger customers  people  below the age of forty , marketing: project manager: So industrial designer: So project manager: that's to that's  there's a market but  they will grow older older marketing: project manager: and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . project manager:  therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be  have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . user interface: Yeah it's  well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , marketing: user interface: but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys marketing:  . user interface: you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and  basically   so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually industrial designer: But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , user interface: Yeah so . Yes yes marketing: that's the the the  the new and the funky things , project manager: mo industrial designer: Because they are already used to that , you know , product . marketing: that's , project manager: Yes it's recognisable industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . So , for example you have  presently  keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and   four five six like that and  you can have keys like this in form like  keys like that project manager: Mael can you hand me over this  ? industrial designer: Yes . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? project manager:  well marketing: 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all project manager: I think fi five min user interface: Forty minutes ? marketing: and it's a very important issue . too sorry , so we basically don't change the  original order of them industrial designer: user interface: but then the keys are more spacious , marketing: user interface: they don't look  so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three ,  four , sorry four here  five and six , marketing:  . user interface: so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice industrial designer: user interface: but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to project manager: Okay . industrial designer: marketing: basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control user interface: Yeah . marketing: wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? user interface: project manager: Of course they have already one . marketing: 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . I well I think many people said  in your in in your research    the appearance of the  R_C_ is is important when they are buying one marketing:  . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . marketing: In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . project manager: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance marketing: Well , we can't , with the price range . project manager: What do What do you think about What componen industrial designer: Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros  per  per R_ s R_C_ marketing:  . industrial designer: and I think  with this now you know that chips are very  cheaps marketing: If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that industrial designer: that's marketing: which would drive the cost up a lot . industrial designer: Ye project manager: Is the L_C_D_ screen marketing: For universal remotes industrial designer: I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term . project manager: I think thi this could be this could be a market because  universal remote controls  tend to be  quite expensive . marketing: And quite complicated to use , project manager: S so we can try to go in between , marketing: yes . project manager: but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal   R_C_ industrial designer: Universal . project manager: marketing: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . project manager:  yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know . project manager: I think  when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . project manager: So d Do you agree ? user interface: Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is  not too expensive . industrial designer: Yeah user interface:  and it d  Our provin industrial designer: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell  four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers  the price of a chip is  price of a chip is very cheap . industrial designer: So I'm okay for designing  a ne  less yeah a a kind of universal  R_C_ yeah . And  basically you can look to the standards of other industrial designer: Yeah that's needed , yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . marketing: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . user interface: Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . project manager: So given we are going for this   universal type  m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific  user interface content industrial designer: Yes . project manager: and  maybe you can look on on what trends are in this  in this type of market . user interface: and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good marketing: project manager: W yes , user interface: for the project manager: we  we can have lunch now . project manager: So  Then th th the next meeting will  user interface: Yeah so we meet in well what are our project manager: after lunch you have  we have  thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting "

        "Query": "What were Barry Hughes' thoughts on the legal framework, infrastructure of out-of-court disposals, targets for performance measures, and the registration of grandparents in relation to the childcare offer?",
        "Summary": "Barry Hughes believed that implementing a clear legal framework would provide clarity for parents and professionals, but there was confusion and ambiguity when it came to prosecution, leading to some cases falling into grey areas. He also suggested that the infrastructure for out-of-court disposals could be developed by the Welsh Government, the police, and crime commissioners. Barry clarified that they did not have specific targets for prosecution, but only pursued cases with reasonable prospects. Similarly, the police no longer had targets, except for certain individuals. Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the focus on registered licensed providers for the childcare offer, aiming for higher quality and a broader range of services compared to individual childcare. However, it was noted that some grandparents who were registered, licensed, and inspected also cared for their grandchildren and other children in small groups.",
        "Article": "Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands, and how do you think the law as it currently stands today, and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment\u2014how does that protect children. barry hughes: Sorry, can I just be clear? How does the law as it presently stands protect children? sian gwenllian am: Yes. barry hughes: We have a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, does provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. In respect of children in particular, you'll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. sian gwenllian am: Well, a review was undertaken by the Government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form\u2014that that would be the best thing to do because there's no evidence that it's not working satisfactorily. You are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that's happened since 2007. barry hughes: I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that. We don't need to go back a very long way to find, for example, that there was no such offence as raping one's married wife, and the law has changed to reflect the fact that that is simply not acceptable. And from what I've seen of the research, and I think back to the 2007 review, to which you've just referred, there is evidence within that review already that opinions are changing. And I've seen research more current than that that suggests that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastising a child than do people of an older generation. Of course, as we move forward in time, the people who are young now are going to be the older adults of the future. We have heard evidence as a committee that this proposed law would provide a much clearer legal framework\u2014that is, to take out this reasonable punishment defence, that then would make things much clearer for parents and professionals. Does the CPS have a view on that? barry hughes: I think it will make things clearer. I'm not sure it will make them much clearer, because if we get into some of the\u2014. And when it comes to prosecuting, it's often the case that things aren't just black and white; there are multiple shades of grey in between. We know that the Children Act did introduce a degree of clarity, in that it removed the defence of reasonable chastisement for offences of causing actual bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and various incidents of child cruelty under the Children and Young Persons Act. There were a series of Court of Appeal cases that sought to clarify the law, but that was at a time, at the end of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, when we had the European convention on human rights and we had a quickly developing body of case law. A decision was clearly made back then in the early 2000s not to include common assault in the same category as actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm et cetera. As we wind forward some 15 years, I have seen the research that suggests that some people see that the present legislation, and the way in which section 58 applies to reasonable chastisement for common assault of children\u2014some people have interpreted that as saying that smacking is acceptable. I don't think that it is what it says, but there is a degree of confusion around that. And the reason why I say it's not as simple as that is, going back to my words a couple of minutes ago, it's rarely a case of being black and white; there are these degrees of grey. sian gwenllian am: What are the areas of grey that you refer to? Can you give a few examples? barry hughes: If you take an example\u2014so, one of the examples that I've heard discussed has been a child\u2014a young child; let's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road\u2014who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic. Now, technically, taking hold of the child at that point is an assault, because it's an unwanted imposition of physical force. But no-one's going to say that's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts. At that point, the parent then seeks to admonish the child, tells them off and smacks the child on the legs. But so much depends upon the circumstances, whether this is something that happens frequently with the child, the size of the child, the parent, the force of the slap, the way in which it's imposed. As we move towards the other end of the spectrum, we might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. There'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police, and the police would take some form of action, and then, as we move through the tiers, it'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. And the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court. That would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that I've just described to you. Does that help to illustrate that, at one end, it's relatively white and the other end it's relatively black, but in the middle we have the shades of grey? sian gwenllian am: But that would mean that there could be more prosecutions at the softer end. So, you are probably aware, but forgive me if I just explain quickly anyway, when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is\u2014. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case\u2014the light smacking on the leg\u2014at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think\u2014and I think this is what will probably happen in practice\u2014that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. It may be that the police decide that it is\u2014it may have been two smacks, three smacks, so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious. We would then apply independently the same test, and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists, which takes us on to considering the public interest. In the circumstances that I've described, every case is going to be unique on its own facts, but in the circumstances that I've described, if it is just a light smack and it's a one-off and there's no history of this, it would probably be the sort of offence we'd decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. sian gwenllian am: But isn't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that? Do you know what I'm saying? barry hughes: If this Bill goes through, then it will remove a defence, which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the CPS than beforehand, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will refer it, because it will depend on the facts of each individual case. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in England and Wales from Dawn Bowden. The Assembly doesn't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the CPS, as you know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that? barry hughes: Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this\u2014and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing\u2014that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. The second example that I'll give you is that we already have within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example I'll give to you is this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 \u00b5g in 100 ml of breath. As you drive into Scotland, you're probably okay to drive if you've got 34 \u00b5g; by the time you get into Scotland, you won't be. And the consequences for you are significant, because of course it's an offence in Scotland, and not an offence in England, but the punishment, namely disqualification, applies everywhere in the United Kingdom. So, we already have a degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognises this. In our code, we have a specific provision that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that? barry hughes: Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, we would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences\u2014and we might want to get into the number of potential offences, but my take on it is the number of offences is likely to be very small and we would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that comes through goes to people who've got a close network and can talk with each other\u2014 dawn bowden am: And that would be primarily around the public interest issue. So you're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications. What's actually been your involvement with the Government as they've been developing this legislation? barry hughes: My own personal involvement? dawn bowden am: Or the service's. I met with a Minister and a Deputy Minister\u2014I met with Huw Irranca-Davies a little while ago, and I met with Julie Morgan a few months ago\u2014to discuss the overall implications, and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other. It hasn't been a very close-knit involvement, but we have had enough involvement so that we've felt we've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation. I don't feel that it's been too much, nor do I feel we've been left on the side at all. Now, we've just talked about the divergence of criminal law, and this is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance. barry hughes: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that. dawn bowden am: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales\u2014well, and in England, actually, across the border\u2014will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law? barry hughes: Not as of the present day. [Laughter.] dawn bowden am: But you would expect that to be something you would\u2014 barry hughes: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes? barry hughes: They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that. Oh no, that's right\u2014obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers\u00a0of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision? barry hughes: I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. What we would envisage is that we would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which are set out, in my view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and we would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that we're discussing here. And we'd need to work that up as we go along, and I think you'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse, if I may put it like that. suzy davies am: It's just that, personally, I think the public interest test is critical in all this, and it would really help us to understand what it could look like before we commit to a particular course of action in supporting or not supporting the Bill, that was all. sian gwenllian am: My point is about the criminal law in Wales and England diverging in this particular instance, and we've been told that this is probably the first time it's happened. Can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion? barry hughes: There are other offences in Wales that don't exist in England, but they don't crop up very often. So, to give you examples, there is an offence of putting an electronic collar on your pet\u2014let's not stretch that into children. But putting an electronic collar on your pet that administers a shock is an offence in Wales; it's not an offence in England. There are also offences around the picking of cockles in west Wales, which is not an offence\u2014. So, you can see there are some, but I would argue that the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England is possibly more significant for the general public. Of course, the topic we're discussing here is of real relevance for the general public, and you have heard evidence, I know, already, that comes from people who are quite strongly in favour and people quite strongly against it. One of the ways in which I've approached this is looking at it from the perspective of what the law is there for, which is to set out, in essence, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to use the law for that, but it signifies how society views a certain behaviour. I like to look at it from the perspective of the person who is being affected by this, namely the child, and the change in the law here would afford children a degree of protection that they don't presently have, but which they do have when they attain the age of 16.FootnoteLink So, I looked at this\u2014. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying\u2014but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. sian gwenllian am: Do you think that what we're doing in Wales will be emulated in England at some point? barry hughes: Well, it's certainly going through in parallel in Scotland, and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this, including a large number of European countries. Who knows? Trying to get any legislation through Westminster at the moment\u2014who knows? Not tomorrow, I'd say. Can I just begin by asking you to help the committee out here in understanding how the burden of proof is going to work if this defence is removed? Because the issue of whether something is punishment or not is going to disappear, providing that it's clear that contact with a child has happened. Is that going to work on the presumption that that's an unlawful contact? Is that something the prosecution will still have to prove, or will it be for an accused parent to say, to use your example, 'I was just dragging them out of the traffic or stopping them putting their hands in the fire'? barry hughes: I understand your point. So, if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement, in a sense that alters some things but it doesn't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution, which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And if the defence raise an argument and say, 'Well, look, that was a lawful act; I was only doing what I thought was reasonable in the circumstances', it's for the Crown to disprove that. barry hughes: And we've got to disprove that to the criminal standard, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. I can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter, to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial, and it would be our responsibility to disprove that. Obviously, when we're talking about CPS guidelines and all the rest, we've already come some distance down the process, haven't we? Have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest? Because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you're arrested, that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like DBS checks in the future, even if it goes no further. Do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on, even at the point of the knock at the door? barry hughes: From the perspective of the CPS, I'm not sure I can help you there. Unlike in many other jurisdictions, we have no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decide not to investigate\u2014. I routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something, and they want us to do something about it and we can't. suzy davies am: Thank you for that, because I thought that was important to get on the record as well. We're looking at a period of a couple of years after this Act passes\u2014if it does\u2014for implementation. Is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law? barry hughes: I think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we've built up with the Welsh Government and colleagues there. We have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and I believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected; that we can liaise, in turn, with Kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop. So, I think we've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose\u2014at least, 'adequate' might sound a little\u2014 suzy davies am: Sufficient. suzy davies am: So, you're confident, by 2022, then, that you'll have changes to the CPS guidelines that are good to go, if you like. Bear with me a second\u2014thank you very much\u2014in your written evidence, you did welcome the indication from the Welsh Government that this reasonable period after Royal Assent would be necessary. Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this? barry hughes: If this legislation goes through, there will be minor financial consequences for us and I don't see any significant financial consequences in the period between now and the Bill becoming law other than the time of ourselves in discussing this today. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will\u2014. Normally, we do this through our case management system, which is England-and-Wales wide, and you'd put a flag on. So, for example, domestic abuse, there's a flag for that, and assault on a child, there's a flag for that. Trying to get that through on a system that covers all of England and Wales\u2014it's quite expensive, unbelievably; it wouldn't happen. My take on it: I've seen and spoken with Matt Jukes about this, from South Wales Police; I have seen the justice impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever\u201412, 18 months, maybe 24 months\u2014where we'd look back to see how we are doing. And I'd like to think that we will be doing that in consultation with interested parties and stakeholders. So, for offences such as racially aggravated offending, whether it's criminal damage or offence against the person, we will bring together interested parties, by which  people from outside the CPS, quite often third sector agencies that represent vulnerable groups. That, in turn, helps us shape and improve the way that we prosecute these cases and I can foresee that, after this legislation came in, we might get 18 months, two years down the road, and I can see us sitting in a room with some of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how we're doing with it all. suzy davies am: That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example\u2014the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children. lynne neagle am: Before we move on, can I just ask\u2014? The Children Act 2004 applies to a child up to the age of 18\u2014 barry hughes: Sixteen. barry hughes: I'm reasonably confident that it's 16.FootnoteLink lynne neagle am: Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill? barry hughes: Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted. vikki howells am: Thank you, that's really useful, and\u2014 lynne neagle am: Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution? barry hughes: Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed. There is a body of law that\u2014 suzy davies am: A child can't consent to assault. barry hughes: Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option? barry hughes: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say\u2014for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth\u2014we\u00a0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering\u00a0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility\u2014that will fall to the police\u2014but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. One final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this Bill\u2014how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited? barry hughes: The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved\u2014the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction. vikki howells am: And who would build that infrastructure, in your opinion? barry hughes: Somewhere within Wales\u2014Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales? barry hughes: I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example? barry hughes: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here\u2014by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes\u2014if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it. sian gwenllian am: Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. It may be\u2014the sort of circumstance I can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'Prosecute me'. So, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in England\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. And do you think that that would be an isolated incident? barry hughes: Yes, truly, I believe, an isolated incident. I've said before that I would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures? barry hughes: I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets\u2014it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean. sian gwenllian am: What about\u2014? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence? barry hughes: I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. Is that going to increase if we change the law? barry hughes: There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication. sian gwenllian am: Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law? barry hughes: No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. sian gwenllian am: Finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point. How to approach that one? In the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the Government, the then Government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the European convention. If Wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, Wales would be more in compliance with ECHR than not, and England would be less so. But nonetheless, at present, I haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case I referred to, Regina v H, which was heard back in 2001 in the Court of Appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. sian gwenllian am: And that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the UK\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the European Union. barry hughes: It could, but I would be a foolish man if I were to say what impact European jurisprudence might have upon us. [Laughter.] suzy davies am: [Inaudible.]\u2014like common law jurisdictions would be. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the Bill will be of great significance to the Crown Prosecution Service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. So, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. What's your answer to that? barry hughes: There is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and I think probably about\u2014. From memory\u2014please never hold me to this\u2014but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. I've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant\u2014what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything\u2014that would be a nonsense\u2014or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. And then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise? barry hughes: No. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and I know that the Ministry of Justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. So, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, I don't think it would be a barrier. I think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it. Can I thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers, which have been fascinating and very clear and most helpful to the committee? You will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Business Committee requesting an extension on the deadline for the Bill, which has now been agreed. Paper to note 2 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services requesting some further information from CAFCASS Cymru on the Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Minister for Education regarding Diamond reform implementation ahead of our scrutiny session on 4 July. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "Query": "What were the Project Manager's thoughts on the conceptual design, symbol and colour, special button design for game players, shape, appearance, and buttons of the new remote control during the discussion?",
        "Summary": "The group discussed pricing the remote control at 25 euros, which was considered relatively high compared to existing options. To avoid losing potential consumers, the Project Manager decided to position the product as a universal remote control with unique features to attract more consumers and meet profit expectations. User Interface suggested designing symbols and colors for the remote, but the Project Manager emphasized the need to incorporate their own logo and color scheme. Marketing proposed self-intuitive buttons for game players, with Industrial Designer preferring a game control keypad over separate buttons. The Project Manager agreed, as keypads were common and user-friendly, allowing for easier navigation and joystick functionality. The shape of the remote was debated, with Marketing and User Interface suggesting an iPod square or a more innovative round shape. The Project Manager opted for a round shape with rounded corners to promote innovation. The idea of a multifunctional remote control was met with concerns about size and complexity. To address this, a touch screen remote control was proposed as a feasible solution.",
        "Article": " I think we  made some definite progress at the last one  and come up with some interesting   w suggestions for our our new remote control .  the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly  and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better .  they've got lots of buttons on them that  people don't use and find difficult to learn . And We we thought that f for our our new   remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy ,  that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That  we want to go for  a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the   the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_  as  a trendy remote control , and and B_ as  a Real Reaction product . So that w  when people are  happy with that , they will they will want to buy  everything else from us . So again  , I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then  we'll we'll make a a final a final  decision .  and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are  what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use   a a a long lasting one . And  I I think our discussion was around the fact that  if we're gonna go for  a long lasting power supply , then basically it's  sealed for life and  if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . And  it it'll be  , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's   , you know , for life , guaranteed for life .  now the the the internal chip  and  this is where I need   Kate's expert advice industrial designer: project manager: and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible  d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ?   I'm I'm I'm n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . And then the  , you know , the the overall design of the case  is is is Kendra's field and  user interface: industrial designer: project manager: we we had some discussions last time as as to  how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those  da today .  and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p  go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both .  and then  , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the  ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and   p perhaps you'd like to start  k .  basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated  into  light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ .  the materials we're gonna need to look at  the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip  works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator ,  two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor .  basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and  which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which  changes the channels .  so as for how we should end up  using this in our remote  t couple of main questions are the buttons .  y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need .  however  to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and  raise the production cost . Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that  they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most  cost-effective way of producing it .  also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that  will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea .  we also need to look at the chips ,  v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all  seem to have agreed upon .  , however that's gonna cost more , but  the off the shelf is gonna be  cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like  voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to  to convert , project manager: Okay , industrial designer: so if we were  definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design  our own chip . project manager:  d d d okay ,   inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . project manager: And and do we know how long it'll take to  develop a a custom chip . Oh w yeah , we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , project manager: Right , industrial designer: it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , project manager: okay . project manager: that would appear to  effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology .   now before we go round everybody else , does anybody  h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? user interface: I I just have a question about that .  does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you  can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites  industrial designer: W just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . user interface: and that w industrial designer: Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . project manager: Cause  I must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . project manager: I d d for slightly different well no , it's if you you speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so  bu  the this this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ? industrial designer:  bits of it , yeah . project manager: So  user interface: Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , industrial designer: Yes , as well . project manager: Yeah ,  true , again but if it's without any without any  p price informations that's  difficult to  industrial designer: project manager:  decide . marketing: Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so . It's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is .   I su i  if given that the  the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before ,  th th the double risk ,  perhaps we ought to  stick to  to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Thoughts ? user interface: Well , another thought I marketing: Would user interface: oh , sorry , go ahead . marketing: Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like  maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . project manager:  do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? industrial designer:  it's fundament well  I guess it it's something we've discussed  since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the  the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to project manager:  I think we user interface: Oh yeah . industrial designer: user interface: Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . user interface: Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . marketing:  yeah , it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . project manager: if if that means  if that means we can't afford buttons but  b b industrial designer:  project manager: second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can  j j just sit there pressing buttons ? user interface: Yeah . Sorry , d did you want to say anything ? No ? industrial designer:  nope , project manager: Okay . Is it gonna work ? project manager:  yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , it's thinking about it . user interface: so I did some research on the internet and  what you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users ,  commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . user interface: and these were just a couple examples of  different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . user interface: There're some special ones available , like this one right here , project manager: -huh . user interface: and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like . industrial designer: user interface: So just kind of minimise the clutter , project manager: user interface: avoid too many buttons and also  one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , marketing:  . user interface: and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . project manager:  I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable . I  , I think it's just sort of the the there's a lot of slide buttons out there . user interface: Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down industrial designer:  . user interface: so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Three buttons , channel up channel up down and user interface: Y yes , yes . marketing: Well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . Because if it if you no user interface: marketing: if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what  , up like one unit , if you see what  . marketing: So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something .  user interface: The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel . project manager: This one on the one side and one marketing:  you could you could as l as like a mouse you could project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Ye yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , project manager: Yeah . project manager: or yeah  th th the  thi this is what the user interface: That was marketing: Yeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , with a project manager: we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know  know what it's going to do . project manager: Okay , so we we're looking at sliders for both a  volume and channel change user interface:  well project manager: of one sort . user interface: I was thinking kind of just for the volume , project manager: Just for the volume ,  . user interface: but what what do you guys think ? marketing: Dep I dunno if it user interface: We could marketing: depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: 'cause if yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , project manager: It yeah ,  it it it seems to me that  it  it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , user interface: B industrial designer: just the way it would user interface: Yeah . project manager: that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo user interface: Yes . marketing: The data's come off internet  from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . industrial designer: marketing: And  the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel project manager: This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , project manager:  . So  and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , so  project manager: Well I  I th I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those .  yeah , and  from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . industrial designer: project manager:  I hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly . But  I was gonna say  yeah , project manager: What ? marketing: fruit and vegetables ,  important to this year  important to furniture , I'm just gonna say  f like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . industrial designer: Well that can kinda tie into our changing  face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year marketing:  . project manager: industrial designer: and  whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: and then we can just whip that off and industrial designer: yeah . You know , that kind of spongy industrial designer: yeah , that weird I dunno what that is , project manager:  .  you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have  a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . user interface: project manager: I  it its  I that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where   on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , industrial designer:  . user interface: Wh project manager: yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity industrial designer: I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . project manager: W  we we can   b but  my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . project manager:  but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better . user interface: So  industrial designer: That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers user interface: like industrial designer: and yeah . project manager: I n I know the only p  the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection user interface: So f project manager: and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together industrial designer:  yeah . project manager: but  I d I I  I know what you're saying and  understand where you're coming from . marketing: Or well , but like  like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you've only got like , you know like th  this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip industrial designer: And then project manager: I th I s I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about  even if it costs slightly more than that ,  just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs marketing: Yeah , you probably are right . project manager:  and , you know giving people the option of buying a new  a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work  totally . project manager:  then if , you know , if people lose the cover ,  they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one  rather than a a complete new re remote . industrial designer: Well that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . project manager: Yeah ,  it is it's up to it's up to industrial designer: So , user interface: Yeah , just another five Euro to get industrial designer: yeah . project manager: it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . project manager:  and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . project manager: And  industrial designer: And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . user interface: Yeah , like they have for mobile phones industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly .  we hadn't finished your marketing:  oh , don't worry it's all said , I was just gonna say  yeah , are we gonna make this as part of like like  a part of the f like it it the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? project manager: It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their  coffee table to say this says something about me . marketing: with project manager: I , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design ,  you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory .  , so  the the the basic shape i is is what we   given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for  channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , industrial designer:  . And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but  know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: you know , t to deliberately get away from the    you know , the the the the square look of most  current  remotes industrial designer:  . project manager: and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow .   or  'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently  displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those . industrial designer: I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , project manager: Yeah  the the  or or b industrial designer: but I'd user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: yellow seems a bit of a strong colour user interface: like an . project manager: Yeah , I'd I'd  industrial designer: to make the ent like the thing user interface: Yeah .  no industrial designer: no , but  just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . project manager: I d I I agree ,  we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently  . user interface: Well n project manager: Well , th this is this is the whole point , yes , you know , I'm I've got a a Real Reaction  remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: And  then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff . user interface: Well I was sort of  kinda picturing like maybe  a shape that's almost like a mouse . user interface: So that , you know , when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand  maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and project manager: Yeah . project manager: Oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though user interface: Kind of a c industrial designer: 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . project manager: W it  well it's sort of it's it's sort of  a a mouse , industrial designer: So maybe it'd be user interface: Yeah . project manager: but held , you know , so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons . user interface: Yeah so yeah , kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had industrial designer: Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: and you can fiddle user interface: then wider up here . user interface: And then it would have a l  wider thing to  have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . marketing: Yeah , that sounds  I'm just I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to .  are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . project manager: we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that  yeah . industrial designer: But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that project manager: Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it , industrial designer: and it's microphone-esque , user interface: Yeah , and just say project manager: yeah , yeah . marketing: Yeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , industrial designer:  . project manager: I th I th honest  my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway  . marketing:  I suppose , but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing . project manager: It's cer it's certainly possible  , but they we we're going beyond w w industrial designer: Bu  . project manager: given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work  .   if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness project manager:  marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: and and sc marketing: that's a good idea . industrial designer: and then you can you can minimise the buttons user interface: Yeah , I suppose I sup industrial designer: and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . project manager: If we we're  I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . industrial designer: Yeah user interface: We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . project manager:    marketing: project manager: Okay , if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . Do we need some sort of display ? industrial designer: But the television would be the display project manager: We actually use the television , okay . industrial designer: that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu user interface: Yeah , and then y industrial designer: and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah . marketing: on a onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . user interface: Yeah , press that is t industrial designer: I never understood how that worked though , user interface: yeah , that might work . user interface: Yeah , it's like  yeah , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . user interface: Yeah , and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . project manager: so  I d I think we've actually very conveniently just  come to  a good point to s to sum up  . project manager: So  b b Kate and Kendra now go away and  pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , industrial designer: Play with play-dough . industrial designer: project manager:  and actually put what we've discussed into something  I was gonna say concrete , marketing:  . project manager: but that's a slightly inappropriate word industrial designer: project manager:  to something that we can we can see and  Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can  actually market this as a concept and not j not just a   a a simple remote control . marketing: Our energy source is gonna be project manager: I think I think we decided that we're gonna for marketing: long term . project manager: for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and  maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source  , industrial designer:  .  project manager: I you know , on the basis that  that , you know , if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then  people are more likely to change it anyway  before i it runs out and  make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for  we'll say at least five five ten years marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And we're having a custom chip ? project manager: We're having a a custom chip , but given the the we've cut the functions down ,  that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that  technol technological innovation is important , industrial designer: project manager: then we need to , I'll say it again , technologically innovate . marketing: project manager:  and  we we , know , we must resist any efforts to  to try and water that down  . marketing: And interchangeable case ? project manager: I i interchangeable case seems to be   important to the concept . project manager:  it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . project manager: And  i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it  to whatever they want , then     this is totally new . project manager: We d we don't know whether that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of  covers that they can use anyway , and  and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then  you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to  a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names , industrial designer: marketing: project manager:  it's  it's good for the supermarket user interface: project manager: and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better . marketing: And  are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or project manager:  the that  that's no , because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant . user interface: Yeah , and especially for making them so like different and industrial designer:  different to feel , project manager: Yeah , yeah . project manager: you know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , industrial designer: project manager: so no ,  given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually   unnecessary I think . marketing: Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just project manager: As  as wide industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and  it's  you know , i i it will work most of the time  . project manager: Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work . industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  yeah ,  I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the  the infrared  . project manager: Yeah , 'cause  the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , so if if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes "

        "Query": "What were the reasons for Marketing's disagreement with the Project Manager and Industrial Design regarding the technical functions, advanced techniques, and touch screen of the new remote control, considering the budget limitations?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager recognized the importance of targeting customers below the age of forty, as they have specific needs that should be addressed. However, Marketing disagreed and suggested that the project should cater to a larger group of people, rather than just those under forty. The Industrial Design team proposed incorporating advanced techniques, such as a touchscreen, to make the remote control more unique. Despite the advantages of a touchscreen, such as making the remote control smaller and easier to use, Marketing rejected the idea due to budget constraints. In order to balance cost and functionality, the Project Manager suggested giving up voice recognition and keeping the touchscreen. However, Marketing's research showed that interviewees had a strong preference for voice recognition, even when they were not informed about the touchscreen. Therefore, Marketing insisted on keeping voice recognition to cater to popular demand. The Industrial Designer believed that it was impossible to create a universal remote control that could accommodate different TV brands, as each brand has its own remote control. However, Marketing believed that this issue could be solved by developing a universal remote control with a code.",
        "Article": "project manager: So marketing: So project manager: I hope you're ready for this  functional design meeting .   we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need  to know the the user  needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and  third part  I don't remember marketing: project manager: which is not very good . marketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it's being modified . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people  s want and  like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . marketing: So basically  what I suggest is that  instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good  remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and  and what they do with them by the way industrial designer: marketing: because they are supposed to be useful . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of  remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . Yeah , so basically what we found was that  there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one  they're not nice colour , not nice shape ,  they're all the same , and they're not l good looking .  what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking  remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that  . And the other thing is that  the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current  facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance  we see that  they zap very often so I think this is a very  important  functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap  in one way or another . And most of the buttons  on  current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls industrial designer: marketing: and they for instance  they don't even find it project manager: marketing: it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is . marketing: Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ? industrial designer: Yeah .  of course phone you can always phone your phone project manager: marketing: but you can't phone your your remote control . industrial designer: marketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , industrial designer:  . marketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls . And  they are bad for R_S_I_ but  I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .  nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check  with my industrial designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe  effect . marketing: I think it's a technical thing industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: which our industrial designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , project manager: industrial designer: and those waves have high marketing: So , it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know user interface: But twenty six percent , do you know project manager: Or something we don't know . marketing: So anyway user interface: One of us marketing: that's for what the biggest frustration  of the user and  industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: s  functions that may be  used by u the user in the current  available  remote controls and  well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . project manager: marketing: Ah now I remember what is R_S_I_ project manager: marketing: it's repetitivity stress injury . marketing: I continue my presentation so yeah , user interface: marketing: channel selection is  very important , very often used . It seems that people find teletext teletext  relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so . project manager: I have been told that we  don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet . marketing: I can tell you that  in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant  not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as  these these two one were had I think ten I think . marketing: Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant . project manager: marketing: That's for the main functions I think and  then we can ask  ourself  what people don't have that may be useful . One of the thing the trend  that  you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about  whether people would like or not to have  this kind of  functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . marketing: So now it really depends on the kind of  targeting  wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? industrial designer: 'Cause marketing: I think if we are targeting young people then  it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now project manager: And  I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . marketing: Yeah one question , user interface:  you are a Market Expert marketing: yeah ? user interface: so marketing: I am . user interface: should we aim at the young people or not ? marketing: I think we should aim at the young people . marketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than more than user interface: Okay , then teletext is used less . project manager: So  now I think it's the turn of the the I'm not sure  marketing: project manager: Of the technical function , so  marketing: So I think it's you , huh ? industrial designer:  it's marketing: No ? user interface: That's me . project manager: what effect industrial designer: techni function of marketing: No , user requiremen industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: I have to do working design so  project manager: So you're user interface: That's but this but number three , yes . marketing: user interface: However ,   Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design .  , as I'm a more an artist marketing: project manager: user interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . marketing: project manager: user interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . marketing: project manager: user interface: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one marketing: industrial designer: It's user interface: which one would you prefer ? I guess this . marketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the  I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . marketing: industrial designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of like , between those two user interface: Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple industrial designer: li project manager: Oh sorry . user interface: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company marketing: user interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it . user interface: it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple . marketing: user interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: It's a really good style , it going to be look like like this . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So Press project manager: user interface: I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium industrial designer:  . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ , project manager: It's off . marketing: And when does it turn off ? user interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the For for enough time marketing: Oh so you have a user interface: like  you marketing: sensing sensor machine that  knows user interface: It's a question to our technical design , our two engineers . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Tech user interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is  volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . user interface: you just control the marketing: According to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . So marketing:  I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ?  is it a touch screen by the way ? user interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . user interface: which makes it easier to find , and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ? project manager:  . project manager:  I see that you target  several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about  universal  remote control . user interface: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . S user interface: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen . Since we were targeting a really soon   date for the the the  i issuing of this  remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah . marketing: So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would I do can I do that with this ? user interface:  twenty five . marketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . marketing: Or is it ? user interface: Basically you use just four or five channels , right ? marketing: Most people user interface: Yeah . user interface: So  set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . marketing: In fact in in one  remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and  sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . industrial designer: But even we can have some  L_C_D_ display , like you can  de you can just button the number marketing: Go to channel twenty five . industrial designer: and then it go marketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . marketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , user interface: But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five marketing: So it would be industrial designer: and then marketing: Okay . industrial designer:  if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . user interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? marketing: Well I could could  have a look at that maybe . I am an expert in  industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many  like digital calculators and electronic calculators . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . So , basically we need  since we are focusing on our interface device remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like  the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital  devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main   device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , project manager: industrial designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s  channel changing and these things . industrial designer: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so project manager:  . industrial designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their  encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . industrial designer: Then , components , so we have the main  energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared  source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , project manager: Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , project manager: industrial designer: we can have another , like  s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . industrial designer: Since we have some kind of  energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put  the small  simple speech recogniser project manager: On industrial designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just project manager:  train it , okay . No , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . marketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , user interface: Okay . project manager: And what about the price of this component ? industrial designer: So  maybe we can make  it in five Euros and even less than that , project manager: It  okay . industrial designer: because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like project manager: industrial designer: then we'll have something like this  we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen . marketing: The user  will just be able to say  please can you  pump up the vo pump up the volume project manager: industrial designer: Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then marketing: Okay . industrial designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words marketing: Okay . industrial designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording marketing: Couple of words . industrial designer: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes ,  they don't really follow same channels strict  so we just want channel number , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else marketing: Of course  it has to be industrial designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three  main basic  anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , marketing: Okay . user interface: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , project manager: marketing: But then I think you you user interface: and and he's coming you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . project manager: marketing: First of all I I think this is not  functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . industrial designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like  switch on , on and off , this processor and This really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s . industrial designer: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key . industrial designer: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control marketing: T_V_ . industrial designer: so and we have only few things here project manager: Sho to to train , okay . user interface: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do  I take my remote control do like something like marketing: user interface: roll 'em up industrial designer:    this point we didn't consider user interface: or roll 'em down . marketing: Very expensive , industrial designer: because it's it's very expensive marketing: no ? industrial designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros project manager: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah . user interface:  why ? industrial designer: and user interface: That's just industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: And volume control . industrial designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really  they just  they don't touch the remote and  y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off marketing: So but  industrial designer: and marketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised   remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay  after one hour I marketing:  . project manager: Wouldn't that make  arguments ? industrial designer: They can make marketing: Yeah , of course . project manager: I want  user interface: industrial designer: Yeah we can have marketing: That's no problem , we will sell more . project manager: And we can increase this the strength user interface: We got a really good Market Expert . project manager: y you can buy one with user interface: Let's send more , let's sell more . project manager:  industrial designer: project manager:  I think , okay , we're just on time . project manager: Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and  we will  meet again for the next meeting , and  in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the  on the components so  you will focus on the component concept  industrial designer: Yeah yeah . project manager:  of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be  focused on the user interface concept industrial designer: Mark will project manager: and  our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo  on the trend watching . And we have  maybe we have to we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? marketing: project manager:  I think automatic on off control  it's not possible . user interface: should it be equipped with the  , with  speakers ? marketing: Speakers in the remote cont user interface: Like , you want to find it , you shout marketing: Oh yeah . project manager:  yeah user interface: control , project manager: that's user interface: and it answers is I'm here ? Or marketing: It just beeps . project manager: yeah ? Think industrial designer: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes project manager: -huh . industrial designer: because it should be all the time on and project manager: And  marketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just  whistle them and and they project manager: And it's answered . industrial designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it . user interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . marketing: Oh that's e that already exists user interface: Yeah , I got it at my home , like . Good project manager: So , marketing: we're done ? project manager: yeah , industrial designer: Yeah "

        "Query": "What was the final decision regarding the chip, feasibility of letting the user program the keys, and fulfilling user requirements?",
        "Summary": "The group made a decision to use a regular-style chip without an LCD display for the controller, opting for simple push buttons with the exception of a more advanced button for the interior lighting system. Concerns were raised by the industrial designer regarding the usability of the function, as it went against the product requirements. The user interface designer suggested that the usability would depend on the user's effort, leading to the decision to produce two versions of the controller - one with full user freedom and the other with some constraints. In order to meet the requirements of being fashionable and spongy, the group agreed to use wood and rubber for the controller. The buttons, which would be the part touched by users, would be made of rubber, while the rest of the controller would be made of wood to provide a natural feel.",
        "Article": "So we have forty minutes to discuss and  finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so Okay , let's talk about  maybe first  for the prototype . project manager: So I handle to user interface: I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me . user interface: It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but industrial designer: marketing: project manager: So in two or three or industrial designer: user interface: Three . industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  okay , can I have the mouse ? project manager: Yes . Alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and  the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour .  , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . marketing: user interface: So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . industrial designer: Yeah the d user interface: Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . That depends on the  s design of the circuit board inside and  what room is left  user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think the microphone is on on the top ,  on the middle , the under the flip . project manager: So that will be the safe , so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to industrial designer: No ,  it depends on the design of the circuit board . user interface: But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . project manager:  it's it's Yeah , but   my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to  the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then  technical I don't think it's  feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . user interface: But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ?  the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice . industrial designer: Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand . user interface:  it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . user interface: marketing: No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . S I'm fine , I'm satisfi user interface: And maybe the shape of the buttons , project manager: I'm satisfied . user interface: the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but industrial designer: We're glad you're satisfied . project manager: Of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy , but I think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight . But And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . user interface: So  maybe this is excessively heavy , but I think it needs to have some weight , project manager: Yep . marketing: project manager: So any comments or  marketing: Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . marketing: Now it goes into this next phase as the financial  marketing  project manager: Yes , that  So I'll come back to the So evaluation criteria , I think  that will be good , so then let's come to the finance  , I have some  calculations which I made  as for  the budget .  it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what  we were talking about that . industrial designer: project manager: So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then  we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . So it's  actually , our budget was  twelve point five Euro , but  it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under  below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money . marketing: Well we haven't come to mine yet , so industrial designer: Oh , okay user interface: industrial designer: . It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ? marketing: we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . project manager: So maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our  marketing , for the sales , okay , and  marketing: Well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a o on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive , user interface: No we do , but it's not filled in . marketing: We don't have the price up there , user interface: Oh , yeah , yeah , project manager: Yeah . marketing: okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what  the company had initially  requested .  industrial designer: So that means we can put the  the L_C_D_ in , yeah . But as far as production  I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see  the problem with  our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration . project manager: marketing:  this is just production cost , it is not  advertising cost , it's not transportation cost  project manager: Yes , so still  we have twelve point five Euro . marketing: And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the  the cost of the unit for the company . marketing: So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down . industrial designer: Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on on-order basis , it might be  the the quantity won't m won't  marketing: Slightly . industrial designer: the circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would  be fixed at the  you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro . industrial designer: That's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding . But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what  I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get  the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or  you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that  I will look after . project manager: You're in four ? marketing: Yep The four gives me it's gotta be  TrendWatch . marketing: It shouldn't be user interface: That's no , I think it's the same one . marketing: Although since  we need to have some type of idea on a market  we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . Okay ? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study . Which means that  if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , project manager: marketing: So , if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that that price , okay , project manager: Yes . marketing: with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers . At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . marketing: Okay ? So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan  the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . marketing: Can it sell it for fifty Euros ? industrial designer: Could could I go to findings ? project manager: Yep . industrial designer:    I would  like to explore the possibility of using  alternative  delivery and sales channel which would be  to use the internet for promotion and ordering project manager: Yes . industrial designer: That way you have no storage , you have no  you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , user interface: user interface: That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , industrial designer:  . user interface: whereas if you're in a store , you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , industrial designer:  . user interface: whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and industrial designer: And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight . It's not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying . You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , industrial designer: -huh . marketing: you can change it  There's a lot of online that's that is doing this now . marketing: And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way  it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility  lower the price of the unit . project manager: I don't think that's  not possible , it's  okay then , l  let's wait for the production , okay , then  you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and  how it look like  the real . user interface: What turnaround time do we have ? project manager: T user interface: 'Cause  production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long . industrial designer: In  We probably should do some market tests  once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . marketing:  that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , project manager: So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks . Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , because we we are not going to do it in  our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua user interface: No no . industrial designer: project manager: So we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time . Or  Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then  it's approve from  the technical team and  your team , okay ,  from the management , then we can launch in the market . Hm ? industrial designer: Any outstanding ? project manager: S Any any other  questions or  comments to be discuss ? industrial designer: No , I'm user interface: What ab industrial designer: go ahead . project manager: Okay , so then  industrial designer: Did you have something ? user interface: Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . industrial designer: project manager: So no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design . Okay ? So we will introduce m this model and  let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can  go for the industrial designer: Second generation . industrial designer: user interface: The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit . user interface: No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . project manager: Yeah , so that's the reason you are here for  the design , okay , I hope you made a good design . We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell . project manager: Yeah , but  see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like  you can eat  you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know , industrial designer: project manager: so we have we have to balance somewhere . I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ? marketing:  . marketing: they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . industrial designer: maybe what user interface: industrial designer: So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event . industrial designer: so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because I don't know when the World Cup is , but I'm sure there's gonna be one . industrial designer: but , so , I'm just ig  pointing out a  a strategy to  do some additional user testing project manager: Research . industrial designer: or  perhaps to  also user interface: That's actually good place to advertise it too . industrial designer: There might be some motion pictures that are coming out  that are coming out on D_V_D_ that  they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with  with Sony Pictures for example . user interface: It's just something to to keep in mind , 'cause it's really really important . user interface: A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . user interface: Really ? industrial designer: Yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product , user interface: That I didn't know . industrial designer: and  people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't  user interface: industrial designer: but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , project manager: . industrial designer: but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't  so , you're right , timing is very important , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You look very relaxed , considering h you know , the  the weight on your shoulders , yeah . user interface: project manager: Okay , so then  let's come to the closing and  are the costs within the budget marketing: Celebration . Okay for  but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and  great design and  let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate . user interface: Thanks industrial designer: user interface: project manager: And see you in the evening for drinks "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the features, functions, evaluation criteria, and usability of the remote control, as well as the functional features to include.",
        "Summary": "The group reached a consensus on the features of the new remote control, including the use of normal batteries, a scroll wheel with rubber buttons and backlights, a round shape, and speech recognition with an advanced chip. They decided to forgo an LCD display due to cost constraints. Marketing initially suggested developing a multi-functional remote control that could control various appliances, but ultimately decided to design it solely for television use. The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of a modern remote control being able to control a diverse range of equipment, which was agreed upon by the User Interface team. The group evaluated the remote control design based on user requirements and received a satisfactory average score of two. Marketing raised concerns about the ease of finding all the buttons, particularly the options button, while the Industrial Designer believed all the buttons were easier to find than a regular remote control. The team discussed the inclusion of a standard wheel, despite its higher cost, and debated whether to include a motion-activated light or continuous light.",
        "Article": "First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . user interface: project manager: So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did .  do you have a PowerPoint or no ? user interface: Yeah , it's in the should be in the m Project . marketing: Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or user interface: You know you could you could do it yourself actually .  well , the function of a remote control , as what  we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .  some of the considerations is just  for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like  we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . project manager: user interface: And we can decide if that's what we want ,  if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .  and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , project manager: user interface: and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze ,  slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . user interface: And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . user interface: And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete .  , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . Who would like to  follow that one up ? Now , that we've discussed marketing: I can go . marketing: Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us  if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really  there's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . So user interface: And that meaning what ? marketing: Like They like I guess use the buttons a lot . project manager: What do you mean by  the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . marketing: whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex project manager: Oh , right . marketing: and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , project manager:  . marketing: and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , user interface: S marketing: but  they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . project manager: user interface: Wait , is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? marketing: Sh project manager: Could be , yeah . industrial designer: Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? user interface: Like project manager: Oh . marketing:  yeah , that's what my web site said , I user interface: Channel , volume , power . user interface: It's like if you're holding it marketing: I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . marketing: But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . marketing: Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is .  the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . user interface: marketing: And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . project manager: And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? marketing: I guess so , yeah . marketing: Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . project manager: Didn't they  didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it user interface: It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'm just trying to move it .  I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . industrial designer:  okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . industrial designer: We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . user interface: marketing: What exactly is a smart chip ? industrial designer: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . user interface: Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? industrial designer: I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . user interface: industrial designer:  power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . user interface: industrial designer:  a large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . industrial designer: Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system .  smart chip that perverts  that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch .  extra bulb could just be for flashiness ,  subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device .  the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . marketing: So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? industrial designer: This is just like a rough schematic . project manager: So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? marketing: Oh okay . user interface: Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . project manager: The l the light up kind of industrial designer: Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , marketing: Like that we know the battery's working . industrial designer: 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? project manager:  . project manager: Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ? industrial designer: I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons . user interface: Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like  the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? marketing: I think we should . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , project manager:  . Okay , let's talk about all of our We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's  wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . project manager: in States we don't have it , but  it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , user interface: I know . marketing: What is it ? user interface: project manager: it's very  bland looking , it's just text on the screen , user interface: Yeah , project manager: not even user interface: it's like black , black and white kind of project manager: Yeah , just black with just text . industrial designer: You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so user interface: It'll give you the sports . marketing: Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? project manager: Kind of . project manager: So anyway user interface: You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , industrial designer: Seemingly . marketing: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? project manager: Right . project manager: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements . industrial designer: So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? project manager: Yes . project manager: What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about  the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So our target group is You mentioned  older people ? Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? user interface: project manager: Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically user interface: It's gonna make it nicer .  they want something user-friendly , so industrial designer:  well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so we want  for our target group would we say , young and old , all age ranges , all  , not kids obviously , right ? Or kids ? marketing: No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . project manager: Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range marketing: Yeah , I think we need it all . project manager:  what about technic technical  specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? industrial designer: marketing:  I would say we should say dumber than the average person . industrial designer: how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . And we wanna keep  I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . industrial designer: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? user interface: project manager: I think so . user interface: project manager: A finding kind of device or industrial designer: And marketing: I need we we need a like homing device . industrial designer: like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? user interface: Oh right yeah okay . industrial designer: What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . marketing: Do you think people'll really go for that though ? industrial designer: It's useful for the remote phone . project manager: Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? marketing: I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . user interface: Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . user interface: Well , then we could marketing: Do w user interface: If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled  demo demographic . marketing: Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge project manager: You could  we could hook it up . marketing: It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , project manager: Oh . marketing: They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and industrial designer: project manager: And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has user interface: Well marketing: just sitcoms and stuff . user interface: Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , marketing: So user interface: 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , project manager: Right . user interface: whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ? project manager:  . marketing: Wait , on the remote itself ? project manager: user interface: Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . user interface: Well , I don't know , if you can like well project manager: Unless you could say the channel . user interface: I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ? industrial designer: I think people would find that too foreign . project manager: And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . marketing: You definitely need project manager: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so project manager: 'Kay . user interface: And how do we marketing: I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . project manager: We could just have the logo in yellow , user interface: Can't make it entirely project manager: or maybe a yellow light for the keys . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . So we've simplified , we don't need all those  play , fast-forward , rewind , user interface: Right , yeah . project manager: So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down ,  the numbers Yeah . project manager:  can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those user interface: Two examples . project manager: Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? user interface: Oh , it's a Yeah . marketing: Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? project manager: The T_V_ .  how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? user interface: Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . user interface: and so it's like marketing: Yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . project manager: Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , user interface: I don't well , I don't know . user interface: Well , that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . marketing: Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . project manager: That one ? user interface: So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , project manager: Right . user interface: including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now project manager: In the middle perhaps . Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? industrial designer: I had something , but I forgot . After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail .  I'm gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept ,  U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? No ? Okay , well , this meeting is officially over "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion about electronics, the segment, the results from the experiments, and the topic of intentionality.",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the best approach for incorporating the recording infrastructure in the room, considering options such as placing tapes in the lip of the table and using LEDs to indicate when the channel is live. Power issues were also a topic of discussion. In terms of representing the Bayes-net, an alternative approach was proposed that depicts context features as classes and their dependencies as relations. This model allows for instantiations of classes, which aligns better with the research objectives compared to the extended belief-net. Recent experiments revealed that adding more languages had a detrimental effect on model performance. However, it was noted that any form of normalization had a positive impact, while MSG had no effect. A demonstration was given on the structure and function of a toy version of the belief-net for the intentionality task. The feature nodes included prosody, discourse, verb choice, the \"landmark-iness\" of a building, time of day, and whether the admission fee was discussed.",
        "Article": "Okay  the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then  I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed  , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . So , starting off with the  last the last one , oh I don't have it here  , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery  , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle  , we're gonna need a scroll  , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and  we're using push buttons  with a supplement of an on-screen menu . user interface: Right , do you wanna start ? industrial designer: Right , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one .  it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and  it's easily adaptable to either hand . You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even  there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . If you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if  the volume buttons rather . If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here . industrial designer: or shall I present the Martian ? user interface: Okay , project manager: The little lightning bolt in it , very cute . user interface:  What We call that one the rhombus , marketing: I could project manager: The v the rhombus rhombus ? user interface:  the rhombus . user interface:  this one is known as the potato ,  it's industrial designer: user interface: it's a marketing: user interface: how can I present it ? It's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely .  the red ones are for  changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's  moves between your favourite channels that you've selected .  this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button  to select and that's basically it , that's the potato . project manager:  on , off ? user interface:  that would be one of your channels , basically , project manager: Okay . user interface: so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off , project manager: Yeah we turn it off . marketing: Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? user interface:  not really , industrial designer: user interface: it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off . project manager: industrial designer: And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . So , that's for your consideration as well , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . industrial designer: We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat . marketing: Sorry , what's the yellow one in the middle , industrial designer:  the menu select button .  basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form  which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever . industrial designer: We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , project manager:  'kay . Yeah , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but user interface: Would Yeah , but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy . I don't know if you picked up your email , but  the f the  feature that we considered for it not getting lost . Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . industrial designer: So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss marketing: But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it . project manager: It's really Would it be very difficult to  just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_  that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? Do you think that would be conceptually possible ? industrial designer: I think user interface: I think it would be difficult technologically , project manager: user interface: because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , project manager:  . user interface: s so it's I'm not quite sure how it would work project manager: That's true ,  'kay . user interface: and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else .   ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ? industrial designer: There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . Okay 'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but  industrial designer: So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ?  . marketing: I feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . I sort of like this one , like I I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat . marketing: But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on . project manager: Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ? industrial designer:  yeah , user interface: Yeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: project manager:   why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ? marketing: Well do we w like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for . marketing: That was industrial designer: So where marketing: I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . Do you need this industrial designer: project manager: or just write on the white board ? marketing: No , I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing , project manager: Okay . project manager: It's kind of like  like a joystick kind of thing , industrial designer: Ooh . project manager: Oh it does , industrial designer: project manager: it's kind of like industrial designer: user interface: It's like a deformed foot , I dunno . project manager: There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem . industrial designer: is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? I like the idea of the project manager: I think I'm leaning towards the potato .  in that like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ? industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Well that on the iPod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level . project manager: But that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: This is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . industrial designer: maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something . Well , as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still ,  'kay . marketing: Okay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s  necessities , the yellowy one is that industrial designer: The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ? user interface: Potato . marketing: So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . marketing: So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . marketing: So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . So like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . marketing: What does each of you project manager: I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two . Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one . marketing: One ? user interface: I think it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two . I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , I don't know if that's gonna be a later one . Well there's some other ones , I will address that , project manager: Okay , then I'm gonna give it a two . Not really ,  not so much , 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , we don't have fancy chip . Other than what it looks like , I dunno if it's really project manager: Well , the kinetic battery . But it project manager: But they'll notice it after like a year , marketing: but we know it's there . marketing: And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . 'Cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really industrial designer: Yeah . I I would say that it's Yeah , like fancy versus creative it's it's different . Everyone else ? user interface: I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique ,  it's it's just it is just pushbuttons  , so I I'd give it a four . marketing: Next , is it easy to use ? Just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , project manager:  'kay .  we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality industrial designer: user interface: marketing: and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way . user interface: Yeah marketing: Iain , what do you give it ? user interface: I'd I'd give it a one . marketing: Alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? industrial designer: user interface:   . marketing: Well , is it gonna be yellow ? industrial designer: It it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ? project manager: That's right , yeah , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in user interface: Yeah . project manager: if we I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity . user interface: Yeah , project manager:  and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? industrial designer: If we had a yellow Sure . industrial designer: So marketing: Alright , so I think it it's industrial designer: it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity . industrial designer: That's a much more trendy than a potato marketing: What are what's everyone's numbers ? industrial designer: one . industrial designer: marketing: Alright  , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . I think we really took that into account a lot , so I'm gonna give it a one . marketing: Okay  , also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent  any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? I think I'll give it a two , 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen . project manager: And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but  marketing:   worth the risk , I think . project manager: I like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two . Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , project manager:  . I just got mine , I still haven't read the instruction book and I'm doing okay , so project manager:  . industrial designer: The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . user interface: I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are industrial designer: Oh , good point . user interface: once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . It's a pretty high learning curve , it'll be easy once you've done it , but industrial designer: user interface: Yeah . Alright ,  also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , so project manager: We we industrial designer: project manager: I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , but marketing: Okay , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 'cause I think that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're kind of not gonna find it , project manager: industrial designer:  I'd say I'd give it  a three , I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . user interface:  I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah . marketing: Alright , we also said simplicity , how w how well does it address just being simple ? industrial designer: Simple to use or simple in design ? Do you know ? marketing: I think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , industrial designer: marketing: so those are the next two things we're gonna look at . marketing:  it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , so I'm gonna give it a two . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: It's hot ,  it's a mango , come on . marketing:  how fashionable can you make a remote ? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . user interface: industrial designer: I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote project manager: I do like  the little Martian one . marketing: And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? Just that it would se serve our audience . marketing: Alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ? project manager: Well  we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . marketing: And so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , project manager:  I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost  , so let me exit out of this first . marketing: Well don't we need plastic , and industrial designer: No , we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . project manager: The wood ? industrial designer: Oh , I guess it was rubber rather than latex . marketing: Do we have more than one special colour ? project manager: Yeah , we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours . marketing: Well , but we know that we're having at least three colours , project manager: So let's y say three . marketing: so industrial designer: Well , are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , you know , we'll like we'll have yellow and black . That I thi industrial designer: Or or is white and black , then two more or project manager: I thought that would be under yours . project manager: Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well , industrial designer: Alright . Oh , we'll do we wa Are the buttons in special colour , special f I didn't get information on project manager: Oh , marketing: Oh wait . So the case material will just have one colour , right , industrial designer: Well , project manager: but then the buttons will be in special colours ? industrial designer: does it marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where I'm getting confused . project manager: Okay , so each unit will only have one colour on their industrial designer: Alright , and each button s project manager: but the case is could have up to thr  the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there . project manager: Special form ? They're all kind of just push button , industrial designer: No , project manager: right ? industrial designer: I think they're fine . project manager: Special material ? industrial designer: Material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah . Oh do I have to do it per button , do I ? industrial designer: No , I don't think so . project manager: Yeah , what can we reduce ? industrial designer: Okay , let's have our buttons all be one colour . Okay , it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive , but we have a simple chip , single curve , marketing: project manager: case material is rubber and it's a special colour , industrial designer: Yeah . How did it get more expensive , what did you just change ? project manager: What ? industrial designer: It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen . marketing: We industrial designer: user interface: What was our target price again ? project manager: Twelve point five . Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to  , you know , use our creativity with the information ,  how how well I guess I led it ,  the how well we worked together as a team ,  the digital pens , the whiteboard . user interface: in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , project manager: industrial designer: like what's a single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count project manager: industrial designer: things , but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well . marketing: Yeah ,  if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account . industrial designer: Do you think we could user interface: marketing: No ,  I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , I dunno . marketing: That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint 'cause I didn't think it made sense to , so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing . marketing: project manager: I don't think anybody dominated it , which I thought was really good , like each of us was able to  like each of you had your information and I  I tried to facilitate it without like taking over ,  industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: industrial designer: Should we have that somewhere on the packaging ? I have a little R_R_ . project manager: I know , industrial designer: project manager: let's think of it like a little jingle . industrial designer: marketing: I like the R_R_ , that's gonna be etched in . Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but  it's quite a useful little gadget . What did we find for new ideas ? project manager: new ideas found ? industrial designer: People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . user interface: industrial designer: That was marketing: Yeah , I didn't even know they existed . industrial designer: I I knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , 'cause you're always moving your wrist .  so , this is the great product kids , I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it ,  especially if we can produce it at twelve point three industrial designer: Yeah . Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the  the final results and . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: I'm afraid I would user interface: That's cool . industrial designer: It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem user interface: Break the stem off . industrial designer: Is it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a Martian project manager: Oh industrial designer: when I put the user interface: marketing: Kind of looks like a penguin , like with no eye . user interface: industrial designer: So are are project manager: user interface: That was bound to happen.$ marketing: Oh , sad . Anything else to say ? marketing: Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , project manager: Alright . project manager: I got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take a master's class ? industrial designer: It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails . marketing: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: marketing: No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us ? project manager: Oh industrial designer: marketing: It's very it's very work relevant , project manager: It is . project manager: Yes definitely industrial designer: Let's see , project manager: I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website . industrial designer: what did I get through the corporate website ? It's just inspiration about circuit boards . project manager: I love Excel , marketing: Here , like , basically project manager: it's one of my favourite programs . marketing: it's like inspiration , basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing , see . industrial designer: Yeah , my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . industrial designer: Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case . marketing: That's like mine it was like , would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? And then it didn't have like any kind of table , like awesome , I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result . industrial designer: and user interface: We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much . project manager: Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me user interface: industrial designer: I yeah . If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up , project manager:  . industrial designer: but marketing: 'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period . industrial designer: Yeah , we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , project manager: project manager: And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint industrial designer: I think if you had a larger group marketing: Get crazy . marketing: And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , project manager:  . industrial designer: We if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright , project manager: project manager: Now when you were  creating your  prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ? user interface:  we we worked together , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:  but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , project manager: industrial designer: So it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape project manager: industrial designer: and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really . user interface: I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , project manager: It's kinda fun . user interface: and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings . user interface: I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . user interface: But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there . industrial designer: Yeah , I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , project manager: I'm not usually a very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes . project manager: I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings . project manager: Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: you know what  , industrial designer: Yeah . And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information , project manager:  . industrial designer: and not sort of made me really like , ooh I don't know , throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite . project manager: It was interesting what came out like later , like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me  , that more points came out from your presentation even . I'm a little I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a  something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point . that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like project manager: About yeah . marketing: Well the problem was , even when we just were creating from the Excel file , there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included , project manager: marketing: There was no way for us to have project manager: Considered the re industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Well marketing: project manager: it's interesting that they industrial designer: I think we really got into it ,  I got into it as the day went on and I got really like , ooh I'm designing a remote control , I dunno if that's just me , project manager: - , yeah . industrial designer: but project manager: It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to  we weren't provided with information to discuss that . project manager: I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: that I just don't know what it is , but industrial designer: I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them .  we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever project manager:  . industrial designer: 'cause there's only one T_V_ and there's only like three chairs . marketing: That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and I always do , anyway . marketing: like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , project manager:  . project manager: It d yeah , it depends on how organised you are personally , but industrial designer: Yeah , or like I guess what the setup of the house is too . industrial designer: But ,  I am notorious for losing my keys , project manager: industrial designer: I just I guess I've just never lost the remote . industrial designer: You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room . marketing: I always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat . industrial designer: But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much . Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located marketing: industrial designer: Oh a G_P_S_ system , internal G_P_S_ . project manager: Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there . user interface: project manager: industrial designer: Just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll . project manager: Well , but if you could attach them to the T_V_ , then you can . I decided to you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . project manager: Just gonna make I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that . project manager: But I didn't have like information to sloth through either , so industrial designer: Yeah , I guess How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , every meeting . Yeah , I didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause I would just get slides with titles on them project manager:  . project manager: Well , the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it wouldn't have a slide for each point . project manager: I know personally when I do PowerPoint , that's what I do and so I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and I would do your three . marketing: You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like project manager: The slogan on it ? industrial designer: No , no , definitely not . industrial designer: No , I don't think we need to user interface: project manager: I think we just need the  the R_R_ , industrial designer: I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one . project manager: Yeah , I was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or . marketing: project manager: Wasn't it interesting that  I thought it was interesting that our market marketing  expert did not agree with the marketing  marketing: Yes . project manager: the marketing choices , industrial designer: user interface: project manager: you know , like industrial designer: marketing: I will project manager: that was a bit of a conflict . marketing: I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , industrial designer: marketing: it's kind of an they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said . industrial designer: I guess it i it sort of a grey , isn't it ? Yellow and grey , but then the slogan's in blue "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on trend watching, appearance design, and product components, as well as the project manager's opinions towards product appearance.",
        "Summary": "The marketing team highlighted three important trends: the desire for fancy and identifiable products, the need for technological innovation, and the importance of ease of use. Additionally, they noted that fruit and vegetable themes were popular, and the idea of a spongy texture was well-received. The group agreed that the remote control should resemble fruit and vegetables in shape and color, but the specific design was not yet determined. The industrial designer proposed two options: a titanium material with a fruity scent or a spongy and fruity-like material. However, the project manager stated that they couldn't have both options and suggested painting the controller to mimic titanium instead. The final decision was not made. The user interface designer suggested a red and yellow color scheme and two basic shapes, a circle and a triangle, referred to as the mushroom design. However, the marketing team disagreed with the mushroom design and decided to change it to a pineapple shape. The group decided to produce a mid-sized remote control with various components such as a printed circuit board, chip, transistor, scroll wheel, power cradle, locator, radio transmitter, antenna, speaker, double curves, LEDs, and buttons. The casing material would be a combination of rubber and plastic. Based on previous experiments and questionnaires, the marketing team found that most users considered remote controls to be ugly. Therefore, the group aimed to create a fancy-looking product to justify a higher price. However, determining what constitutes \"fancy\" was challenging due to differing opinions. The project manager agreed that the product should be visually appealing but cautioned against using too many colors to avoid increasing costs. Additionally, the project manager suggested incorporating an image that represents society on the remote control for easy recognition.",
        "Article": "project manager:  and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? N user interface:   .  in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching ,  how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl  was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . So what are our findings ? In our  in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that  people l  people do have preference for tho fancy mobi  f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel  good . So we should take into  we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as  the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv   in our mark  means in take in designing our rem  remote controls . user interface: The last one is the most important one , is it ? marketing: No the first one is the user interface: Oh , sorry . marketing:  the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , project manager: user interface: Okay . marketing: the fancy design  rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo  remote controls are . So it  should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , user interface: marketing: there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi  remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated  like this way . And it should be  and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . marketing: Y yeah  yeah , we have to , because  d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , project manager: user interface: marketing: because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: We should make a big sponge lemon , marketing: becoming industrial designer: and then it'd be it would be yellow . marketing: And people  the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . marketing: So user interface: Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can marketing: No it ca y a user interface: Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? marketing: The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co user interface: Okay . 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , user interface: Okay . marketing: because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , project manager: Alright , okay . marketing: so we don't want to have any harm to the society , user interface: -huh . marketing: user interface: And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? marketing: S  we didn't find out any such point . marketing:  yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so project manager: --  so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them ,  I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you  have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but I think standard kind of  shape and  play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , project manager: Right , okay . user interface: I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . project manager: user interface: And we've got some pictures of some  new remote controls to show you . user interface: Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just project manager:  no just escape should  user interface: Escape , okay . user interface: There's  an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . user interface: This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , project manager: - , like the middle button . user interface:  and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , industrial designer: project manager: Ah it's kinda like scrolling user interface: like would the computer come project manager:  right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of  menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . user interface: -huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , project manager: Right , okay . user interface: is it ? But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . industrial designer: user interface: You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . user interface: And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . project manager: Yeah , I m  the one thing I think about about these ones is  these kl  secured areas  , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .  so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . project manager:  is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? user interface: I guess so . I like some of these things  the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out  that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .  but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different  buttons . project manager: 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? user interface: Yeah , exactly . So we need to combine those ones  industrial designer: user interface: and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . user interface: It's you program it like you say , record ,  and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much Yeah .  personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the industrial designer: The L_C_D_ user interface: Yeah . user interface: And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , marketing: But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , user interface: are we ? marketing: but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . But our budget , we've project manager: It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . marketing: So even if we increase our cost little bit , within  some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . user interface: I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros  per  twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . I can't see tha Although , th  to be to be sure they have got  they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , industrial designer: user interface: The L_C_D_ . project manager: so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small industrial designer: project manager: But  like I I the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . industrial designer: project manager:  but , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens , user interface: No . industrial designer: But  price price not withstanding  , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? marketing: And the project manager: Twelve fifty . marketing:  i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa project manager: Possibly . user interface: Yeah , that's the thing , because industrial designer: But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? You're looking at the T_V_ project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: It just seems kind of like a a needless th user interface: And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . user interface: It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the  the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . industrial designer: So which vegetable ? project manager: Well  we could make a user interface: Yeah , I know , carrot . project manager: Well , si since we're going for the  the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s industrial designer: The the lemon . project manager: And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . So they'd be able to use that  , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . project manager: And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , project manager: Yeah , looks like it . industrial designer: and I'll I'll give you the  , I guess , technical considerations for those . project manager:  user interface: industrial designer: And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it . So , the way I'm gonna do this is  we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work ,  reuse the the vital kind of  essential pieces of it , project manager: industrial designer: and then we'll throw in our new innovations  and keep it all within budget . project manager: industrial designer:  you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , project manager: industrial designer:  and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which  receives input from the buttons , and ch project manager: So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? industrial designer: Right , it's very they're very cheap remote .  so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the  to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , user interface:  so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the  project manager: Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? industrial designer: R  no ,  this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be ,  the board we have to use basically  the same set-up , processor ,  we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard .  so for the casing ,  this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team  , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot ,  latex , double-curved , curved . industrial designer: what do we think ?  or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . project manager: Well ,  like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . industrial designer: Yeah so project manager:  so maybe s  a sort of  plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? industrial designer: Okay so , here are a a plastic ,  latex user interface: I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , project manager: Oh right , okay . user interface: you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and industrial designer: Oh right . industrial designer: and the colour is yellow , right ? user interface: Yeah , project manager: Or at least incorporating , yeah . project manager:  I forgot i we're sort of  I don't know what other standard silver kind of user interface: I think project manager: Other parts or  user interface:  . Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours project manager: user interface: or i if we're having buttons actually , industrial designer: So yellow for the body , user interface: I don project manager:  . industrial designer: and then what colour for the buttons ? project manager:  I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . user interface: You do have ones like  play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah or yeah a limit  maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .  if we are gonna make it a novel  double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer:  'kay so the shape we wanna go  how exactly ? Maybe double user interface: Like  an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , project manager: Yeah it's  , yeah , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . user interface: or just like a It's not industrial designer: What about a banana ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , project manager: Well , yeah ,  like industrial designer: 'cause it's yellow fruit , user interface: industrial designer: right ? project manager: Yeah , yeah . user interface: How would you point it ? industrial designer: Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . user interface: What industrial designer: We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: because then this this will help us in our advertisement also project manager: marketing: and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . project manager: Huh ? user interface: y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . industrial designer: So a spongy banana re marketing: project manager:  that that th user interface: Rubber banana . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ? marketing:  the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , project manager: S industrial designer: See marketing: like people  now project manager: And sponginess . industrial designer: So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable user interface: And spongy , yeah . user interface: Like what's what's that , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . industrial designer: Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? project manager:  . project manager: user interface: 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: and industrial designer: and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . Well , I guess it's kind of dra  you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , user interface: No . industrial designer: Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . And buttons would , did we say ?  different shapes of buttons ? industrial designer: project manager:  I l I su  for the specific functions , you know , up and down ,  play , stop . industrial designer: Okay , so project manager: They've got , they've got standard sort of intuitive  industrial designer: so buttons . industrial designer: With the scroll-wheel or no ? user interface: Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? project manager:  speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . industrial designer: Where should I put the microphone ? project manager:  ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? user interface: Yeah , I'm not sure . industrial designer: Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? user interface: I couldn Yeah . project manager: And  I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or project manager: I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . user interface: And  so what else was there ?  the industrial designer: project manager: user interface: What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? project manager: I s I still like it . project manager: 'Cause  like  if we  how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? user interface: Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? industrial designer: They can work from a project manager: Yeah , you know , and then you just tal industrial designer: You don't have to hold it . project manager:   some  I user interface: Yeah , do we need buttons ? project manager: l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like  , I dunno , an apple . I quite like the design of that ,  'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . user interface:  project manager: user interface: and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . industrial designer: But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . marketing: we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . marketing: So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , user interface: In that w project manager: It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing  user interface: Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , marketing: S s sorry ? user interface: didn't you ? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things marketing:  like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone  we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , project manager: user interface: so we could do that , like have a choice . marketing: okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . marketing: If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . user interface: We still need the buttons in the same places thought , marketing: Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . user interface: marketing: Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , user interface: Oh , that's the other side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . marketing: So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . marketing: And project manager: I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , user interface: Okay . project manager: 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . project manager: You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , user interface: Yeah . project manager: unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the user interface: industrial designer: Okay ,  so marketing: project manager: So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: industrial designer: s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or project manager: Yeah . Well ,  because Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and  because what project manager: Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . user interface: Yeah , w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , project manager:  'kay . user interface: because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . project manager: So again  like we could have , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different user interface: Okay . project manager: colour , but have user interface: Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . project manager:   e even if user interface: Because project manager:  not necessarily that the  the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know  blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . project manager: So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .  as for the energy source  , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that .  I don't know what that means , we crank it ? project manager:  It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . industrial designer: So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . marketing: But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat project manager: It does leave them with an obligation to marketing: Yeah , to mo Yeah . marketing: because most of the people project manager: Then if it's just sitting on the user interface: Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah . marketing: solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and the days when there is no sola sunlight project manager: I'm I'm with  Raj on that , industrial designer: Okay , so probably just marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think , you know , marketing: What we w project manager: I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . project manager:  I w I w  user interface: project manager: that idea that I thought  just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother industrial designer:  . project manager: is having a , user interface: And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? project manager: yeah , marketing: Yeah . project manager: having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but  for using it as  recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . What's chip on print ? What's industrial designer:  ? project manager: Sorry , never mind . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , user interface: So  yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . project manager: Yeah , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . project manager: Okay , we're we're kind of  we're kind of  Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing . Was that you ? industrial designer: Huh ? project manager:  that was your bit's covered , industrial designer: Oh yeah that was that was it . project manager: and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . project manager:  yeah , I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . project manager: Yeah , can you save that  send that last one again , please , Raj , marketing: Yeah . project manager: as I still can't find it on the marketing:  it was under a different name . project manager: that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . But I cou can't open that , because it w asks  for some username or password . project manager: Yeah , I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my  on my agenda .  okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and  .  no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions , marketing: user interface: No I'm good . project manager:   we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a user interface:  "

        "Query": "What were the group's thoughts on the safety design, kinetic battery idea, wood case, and shape of the remote control during their discussion on the design and concept decisions?",
        "Summary": "The team reached a consensus that the remote control should have a waterproof design and be baby-proof to prevent any accidents. It was also agreed that the remote should have voice control functionality for children who may not be tall enough to operate it manually. Additionally, a child lock feature was deemed necessary. The group acknowledged the benefits of using a kinetic battery, but cost and reliability were concerns compared to a regular battery. They suggested using a cheaper chip to balance out the cost of the kinetic battery technology. The User Interface team expressed difficulty in keeping the remote small with a wood case, as the Industrial Designer believed it would be prone to breakage. The Project Manager proposed using rubber or plastic instead, considering practicality and ease of cleaning. The idea of creating fruit or vegetable-shaped remotes was discussed, with the understanding that only the exterior shape would change while the PCB remained the same. The team also considered offering customers customizable skins.",
        "Article": " it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock .  okay our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations  and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different  functions of it . And s  in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials  and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . The case ,  the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do ,  there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic .  buttons , for buttons we have  pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , project manager:  . industrial designer: which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen .  circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are .  we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of  using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . Or a solar battery , although there are slight  complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . industrial designer: Or  something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you .  personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything project manager:  . industrial designer: any ideas on that ?  I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll  buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . project manager: industrial designer: But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down .  we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down .  I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . marketing: Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ? industrial designer: I'm not sure . marketing: 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve industrial designer: This is what I'm sort of marketing: and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , I wonder industrial designer: I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . But the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . project manager:  just a real quick question  the weight of these different elements , have you industrial designer: Yeah , n project manager: no idea , okay .  I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , project manager: industrial designer: and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , project manager: industrial designer:  but other than project manager: industrial designer: that's really basic , that's all I have gotten so far . industrial designer: I have save this in the  shared projects , if anyone wants to look project manager: Thank you , perfect . industrial designer: and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . project manager:  if you made notes yourself you can put those on our  underneath our oh ,  in your book , industrial designer: Just in my notebook , project manager: then don't worry about that . industrial designer: but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . Alright ?  I guess I can project manager: 'Kay now we're  concepts concepts of user interface . user interface: Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device .  we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . We have a number of different choices for a design concept  and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of  , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , industrial designer: user interface: how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device .  once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and  the extra functions and the more advanced features . industrial designer: user interface: So basically , marketing: user interface: that's what we don't want .  you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen .  you can just about make out  that the button three buttons are  previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time .  then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often .  most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored .  other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ ,  I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ .  you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow .  and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or  have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . user interface: And that would allow you to access access the advanced features  whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . industrial designer: So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? user interface: I think that's that's one way to go , yes . user interface:   there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . user interface: There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're I industrial designer: Right user interface: well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device .  it would also have to have  a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , project manager: user interface: but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control .  a bit like a bit like how they have these  digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up . project manager: I do think that  one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . project manager: like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's  you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . industrial designer: Well Are you are you tak project manager: Like I I know I use that often enough . marketing: Wait , but is that separate from what he was saying ? project manager: Well industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a industrial designer: No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , user interface: But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c  communication is one way , project manager: user interface: so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . marketing: Should I plug that in ? project manager: marketing: user interface: Is that going on ? Okay . marketing: Is it on ? Ri What F_ do you have to press , project manager: Eight . Basically , I was given  an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . project manager: marketing: So first  they had people they ranked  the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , industrial designer: Okay . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun ,  in a year , so user interface: marketing: even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . industrial designer: marketing: Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . user interface: industrial designer: That there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: that pretty much sums it up . marketing: Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ? project manager:  do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ?  how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or  or the spongy material at all ? user interface: project manager: Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? It would be easier on the hands . industrial designer: If it's latex if it's latexy project manager: It's kind of and then it industrial designer: mean project manager: we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , user interface: A kind of thing that project manager: I dunno . But industrial designer: An  I if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , project manager: industrial designer: but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . It's there's something to be said ,  we we got that thing earlier from you about  not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: Yeah , so something , m m instead of a necess industrial designer: something grippable ,  we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . marketing: yeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , user interface: Yeah . marketing: you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , industrial designer: marketing: like I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called . industrial designer: Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable . could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them , project manager: F for sure , or maybe like marketing: industrial designer: li project manager:  couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . project manager: Could they be smelly ? user interface: I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ?  like  I dunno , like  carrots or something . marketing: project manager: Or carrot shaped , industrial designer: it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot project manager:  . industrial designer: isn't it ? user interface: Maybe , project manager: Like large button , industrial designer: Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . marketing: What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . project manager: would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ? marketing: Just to tie it in a little . When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? Or your fingers ? marketing: Yeah . Maybe industrial designer: I user interface: Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb . project manager: Don't you think ? industrial designer: No marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: just thumb-sized . industrial designer: Jus project manager: But  in order to get to all of them , marketing: But I like i project manager: you know . user interface: But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps . I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . user interface: So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . user interface: and And you find that works quite well ? marketing: I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . user interface: Is that marketing: 'Cause th user interface: The button on an iPod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ? marketing: It's like five , project manager: It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel . industrial designer: yeah , it would  each version of it has been a little bit different , project manager: The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think . industrial designer: but Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . marketing: I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . marketing: Like just the idea of like those industrial designer:   marketing: so few buttons for main things , industrial designer: t marketing: but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . marketing: 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Yeah , I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ industrial designer: Right . industrial designer:  project manager: Okay  we have we've about fifteen minutes left , industrial designer: Oh we probably have to get going , don't we ? project manager: so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation .  I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all industrial designer: 'Kay .  industrial designer: Could Could we  could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , marketing: If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . project manager: Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex industrial designer: Exactly . user interface: I think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . user interface: So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside . marketing: Lemons ? industrial designer: user interface: project manager: Okay ,  marketing: project manager: components concept . project manager: G industrial designer: Right , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary but  project manager: That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . So can you just explain what that is real quick ? industrial designer: Alright , so  decisions , what the okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . industrial designer:  I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? project manager: I think it's awesome . user interface: Yeah ,  I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the  how reliable it is , industrial designer: Right , I haven't gotten any user interface: but as far as I know , the technology is good . industrial designer: yeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but  but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think . They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . project manager: industrial designer: I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done . But I don't know any decisions on marketing: project manager: If they're if they're really options . industrial designer: I did f user interface: Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think .  oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got .  , 'kay , the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? user interface:  I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . user interface:  but project manager: but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . 'Cause you don't have control over numbers user interface: I don't think it would really work . marketing: Yeah , it's a project manager: or industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . industrial designer: th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . marketing: But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be user interface: Yeah . marketing: and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . marketing: And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . project manager: So , have a scroll for volume ? industrial designer: F or for all those secret functions ? project manager: F industrial designer: When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . user interface: I think yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later . project manager: I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide  whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . industrial designer:  I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . project manager: I'm a little  I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . project manager:  marketing: Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ? industrial designer:  yeah , everything I've project manager: Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . industrial designer: N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's  like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . industrial designer: Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , project manager: Ge o industrial designer: I think that that's done for us . Okay  let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . industrial designer: Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ? project manager: Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ? marketing: I'm thinking curved of some sort . industrial designer: We don't really know what the difference project manager:  okay , interface , the type and the supplements . So push or scroll , user interface:  project manager: right ? Or both ? user interface: Yep .  And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . user interface: So in terms of  in terms of  economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . And if we had a sc an on-screen  kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno . I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case user interface: Yeah . project manager: Is that okay with you ? industrial designer: because project manager: How you feeling ? marketing: Yeah .  I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , project manager: marketing: but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . project manager: Okay , so we're gonna go with  type pushbuttons , and then supplements , user interface: Yep . project manager: how are we gonna do that ? user interface:  what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? project manager:  I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the  the additional buttons we can use . user interface:  project manager: So we're gonna have like a menu button , industrial designer: Oh . project manager: Okay ,  so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . user interface:  in industrial designer: So what are what are our buttons gonna be ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So like one through five , or user interface: Yeah , yeah marketing: Like a radio type sorta situation ? user interface: about yeah like yeah , a bit like radio presets .  project manager: Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need  numbers one through zero , right ? user interface:  we wouldn't even need the numbers . project manager: Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . user interface: and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , industrial designer: Yeah , up down .  our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , industrial designer: project manager:  you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . project manager:  did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ? industrial designer: Simple chip "

        "Query": "What are the current thoughts on using XML tools and the status of transcription?",
        "Summary": "Summary:\nGrad H mentioned that they were working on standardizing data in XML format, but expressed dissatisfaction with the current format. They were also developing tools to extract information from XML files using Java and Perl. The transcriber pool has been meeting expectations in terms of work completed within the allocated time. Grad D explained the importance of combining different experts in the network to adapt to various situations, suggesting dividing the network into parts and allowing it to determine which experts to trust in each situation. The transcriber pool is making good progress and may be utilized for other coding tasks in the future, such as analyzing speaker overlap. They are also coding non-speech gestures like breaths and laughter to improve recognition results. The group reviewed transcription checking procedures and discussed coordinating data channelization and presegmentation with tighter time bins.",
        "Article": "But  we 're gonna try to make this an abbreviated meeting cuz the the next next occupants were pushing for it , so . Agenda is according to this , is transcription status , DARPA demos XML tools , disks , backups , et cetera and grad h: Does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ? professor b: OK . grad h:  phd d: I g grad h: as a somewhat segue into the next topic ,  could I get a hold of  the data even if it 's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ? postdoc a: Certainly . So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there . grad h:  and then just we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made . professor b: OK , wh phd d: I also got anot a short remark to the transcription . I 've  just processed the first five EDU meetings and they are chunked up so they would they probably can be sent to IBM whenever they want them . phd d: but the other ones phd f: That 's the one that we 're waiting to hear from them on . postdoc a: These are separate from the ones that phd f: As soon as postdoc a: these are phd f: They 're the IBM set . And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK grad h: Is my mike on ? Yeah . phd f: and we get the transcript back and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , then  we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch , postdoc a: Excellent . grad h: And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ? phd f: Yes , exactly . phd f: We 're sort of doing things in parallel , that way we can get as much done a at once . grad h: Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it , phd f: Yeah . grad h: Right , which  So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , so the front - end is the user interface and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for  conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it , do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting , phd f: What what kind of  what does that look like ? The string that you type in . phd f: What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ? grad h: Keywords . grad h: Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything . professor b: And then does it play something back or that 's something you 're having to program ? grad h: right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools , professor b: Yeah . grad h: but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? We have two tools that have already been written . grad h:  the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: I Can I ask a question ? So  as it stands within the the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play . So e Are you So you 're adding like  , I don't know ,  are they fuzzy matches or are they  ? grad h: It 's a sort of standard , text - retrieval - based So it 's  term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring . grad h:  and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that . So it it 's postdoc a: It 's a lot more sophisticated than the  the basically Windows - based grad h: i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that . grad h: So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents . Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search . grad h:  you have to do preindexing and so that these tools do all that . And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it well  to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings . grad h: So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that . phd f: So what does the user see as the result of the query ? grad h: On which tool ? phd f: THISL . grad h: The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK phd f: Yeah . grad h:  you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits and you can type on them and listen to them . professor b: Mmm phd f: So if you typed in \" small heads \" or something you could grad h: Right , you 'd get phd f: get back a   something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred grad h: something You you 'd get to listen to \" beep \" . It 's too bad that that couldn't come into the grad h: You couldn't get a video . phd g: Guess who I practice on ? postdoc a: At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , that keeps coming up . Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable  demo sort of format . grad h: And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally phd f: That sounds really neat . grad h: and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .  Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I 'll work with him on it . And it it 's looking pretty good , you know , the fact that I got the query system working . grad h: If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's  , I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . phd f: But you were saying that that the  that there 's that set of tools , Cygnus tools , that grad h: So . grad h: But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer , professor b:   phd f: And you have to have all the o grad h: But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't and  different compiler work - arounds and so on . So the fact that  it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows . professor b: How about having it run under free BSD ? phd e: Well what you need grad h: Free BSD would probably be easier . phd e: All you need to do is say to Dan \" gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf \" and it 'll be done in a day . phd d:  phd e: Right ? grad h: Actually you know I should check because he did port it to SPRACHcore phd e: Right . professor b: So grad h: I 'll check at that professor b: But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . phd e: What I phd f: How does it play ? grad h: Yeah , right . professor b: If he has then you learn , if he hasn't then he 'll do it . So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with   , SoftSound guy ,  postdoc a: It 's amazing . professor b: Tony Robinson ? phd f: Tony Robinson ? grad h: Do  Tony ? I guess I do . grad h: Which one do  ? phd e: Steve Renals is not SoftSound , is he ? professor b: No . grad h: so that 's all going pretty well , professor b: Assuming we 're phd e: Right . phd f: What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ? grad h: I think we 'll be OK with that . phd e: Why don't you try and merge Transcriber and THISL IR ? They 're both Tcl interfaces . grad h: Well this is one of the reasons This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have  Dave Gelbart Gelbart Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff phd e: Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality and it 's grad h: Yeah , yeah , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack . Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts  eh you know , from speaker to speaker . grad h: And if it doesn't phd e: Right ? Do you have you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ? grad h: Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so . It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about and having the search tools and so on . grad h: but professor b: The thing I was asking about with , free BSD is that it might be easier to get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in grad h: Yeah ,  we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments , professor b: Yeah . grad h: so   My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . grad h: It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the \" include \" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different . grad h: So I it might be a little easier but it 's not gonna be a lot easier . So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , then we talked about  some other stuff which would basically be  showing off the the Transcriber interface itself and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , but but  ,  and part of that was showing off what the speech - non  nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like . postdoc a: Can I ask one more thing about THISL ? So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized  ? grad h:   phd g: So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody  work that Don 's been doing . phd g:  actually show some of the features and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries . professor b: Well I think at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that phd g: I don't know if that would be of interest or not . professor b: cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point phd g: Yeah . professor b: pointing at something I don't know much about , phd g: you 're looking at this now professor b: so . phd g: Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ? grad c:  yeah I 'm starting to and  Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on . phd g: Yeah def professor b: S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month phd g: I professor b: and then that 'll give us a week or so . The end of phd g: Oh , the end of this month or next month ? Oh , you mean like today ? grad h: This month . professor b:  that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to  to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , phd e: Exactly . phd g: Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's professor b: Yeah . phd g: cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our you know , the research , visualizing what these features are doing professor b: Yeah . professor b: so  , you know , to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . professor b: So that 's phd g: I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data so it might be neat , you know . So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools where you we 're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything and I think that 's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools . So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .  it works with Transcriber but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools  because it doesn't mark start and end .  , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files , either  information on users because the user database is that way I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m  various inf  sorted information on individual meetings grad c: Cool . And so l just let me know there it 's mostly Java and Perl but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable . Is do we have the the seat information ? In in the Key files now ? postdoc a:   grad h: The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which postdoc a: Ah . phd g: Oh in For the new one grad h: it 's been recorded , phd g: OK . phd g: I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? professor b: Yeah . phd f: how how w eh where is it in the Key file ? grad h: Right . phd g: Cuz  I haven't been putting it in and in by grad h: You haven't been putting it in . postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits ? professor b: Some of these are missing . phd g: And professor b: Aren't they ? postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits forms ? professor b: Some fall out of phd g: Well it grad h: Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . phd g:  they 're on th right , these , but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files . phd f: Yeah I I never phd g: And I don't think Chuck was either phd f: I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file . phd g: cuz grad h: I had told you guys about it phd f: Oh really ? phd g: Oh , so we 're both sorry . grad h: but phd g: So grad h:  this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text phd g: OK . grad h: I think it 's Edit - key , command Did I show you guys that ? phd d: Yep . phd f: You mentioned it , grad h: I did show it to you , phd f: yeah . grad h: but I think you both said \" no , you 'll just use text file \" . grad h: Yeah , and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings . grad c: u grad h: Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike , phd g: Yeah . phd g: maybe I forgot to d phd f: Takes me no time at all to edit these . grad h: Yeah that 's cuz you kn phd f: I 'm not doing anything . phd g: And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , \" oh what did Chuck do , OK I 'll do that \" . grad h: And then  also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under \" participants \" they were filled in under \" description \" . Oh  also I 'm working on another version of this tool , the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected . And it 's not quite ready to go yet because  it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . So I 'm working on that and it it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out . grad c: Will that also include like batteries dying ? Just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically . phd f: But with the screensaver kicking in , it phd d: But grad h: Now phd d: y yeah . grad h:  the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on the thing . postdoc a: It would be nice if if these had little light indicators , little L E Ds for grad h:  buzzer . grad h: \" Bamp , bamp ! \" professor b: Small shocks postdoc a: Yeah . Oh grad h: OK , disk backup , et cetera ?  I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and he pretty much said \" yeah , you could do that if you want \" but he thought it was a bad idea . In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing  NW archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . grad h: And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . professor b: Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . But he said that that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that , that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably OK . professor b: Really ? grad h: And  , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and  recording meetings . professor b: So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ? grad h: Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable . professor b: Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had  phd e: I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ? grad h:  unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain . grad h: Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure . And second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last . grad h: So I think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea . Can I add one top topic ? We have time ? I wanted to ask , I know that  that Thilo you were , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? And I wanted to know is th phd d: Yeah it 's it Basically it 's done , postdoc a: It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . grad h: Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work . phd d: Yeah it Yeah , it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but it 's solved . Does this mean that the that this could be por  ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of  phd d: Yeah , basically  I did install it on my laptop and yeah postdoc a: Wonderful . CrossPads ? CrossPads ? grad h:  got an email from  James Landay who basically said \" if you 're not using them , could you return them ? \" So he said he doesn't need them , he just periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them and asks them if they 're still using them . professor b: Once ? grad h: We we used them a couple times , postdoc a:   phd f: Them ? There 's more than one ? grad h: but postdoc a: Yeah . professor b: But grad h: My opinion on it is , first , I never take notes anyway so I 'm not gonna use it ,  and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with . postdoc a: And I have  so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the but I I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . I do take notes , I could be taking notes on these things and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings but I don't know . phd d: what is a CrossPad ? professor b: So it 's it 's  it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . grad h: And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things . grad h: But I don't take notes , professor b: And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because  we were interested in in higher - level things , grad h: so . professor b: not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? And  I think that was one of the things , phd d: Yeah . We 'll have a you know , have a scribe , have somebody  take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . And then we did it once or twice and we sort of grad h: Yep , and then just sort of died out . professor b: probably chose the wrong scribe but it was It 's  phd g:  grad h: Yeah that 's right . postdoc a: u but I guess the the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface . phd f:  we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ? postdoc a: Oh it 's la it 's useful , grad h: Because that 's summary . phd g: I think there 's also there 's this use that phd f: Summarize it from the transcription . phd g: the Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X and you don't wanna take notes and you 're you just wanna phd f: Doodle . phd g: get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you know , and and then while you 're bored you don't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X and But in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . I know we haven't been using it but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods grad h: Right . professor b: I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later phd g: so . professor b: and and and put some kind of summary or something  you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . But then you don't you don't have the time reference  that you 'd have if you had it live . And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , professor b: Yeah . phd f: How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ? phd g: so . grad h:  that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time phd g:  postdoc a:   grad h: You know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery postdoc a: Well when when I d grad h: and so you postdoc a: OK . grad h: so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information . phd e: Why grad h: And so there 's a lot of infrastructure which postdoc a: There is an alternative . grad h: unless someone postdoc a: There is an alternative , it 's still , there 's  you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . You c  , I when I when I did it I synchronized it by voice , by whispering \" one , two , three , four \" onto the microphone grad h:  . grad h: Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end phd e: Right . grad h: which someone has to listen to that and find that point , postdoc a: Yeah , it 's transcribed . phd g: Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? Would h  is there a big cau grad h: We can keep all both of them for the whole whole year . phd g: just just in case we grad h: it 's just phd g: even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate  f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out . professor b: Well one thing that we might try  is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . professor b:  part of the reason I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in  the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and grad h: Yep . professor b: and so forth so and and Jane is more into it but eh  you know I don't know if you wanna really do do this all the time so I think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . The p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with  quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to   routinely use it ,  it just hasn't happened anyway . But maybe if we can get a person to phd g: Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute . phd e: Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card . And and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the Linux server and  phd g: So what kind of input would you be ? phd e: so so , if you 're not worried about grad h: Buttons . phd g: You 'd just be pressing like a a phd e: Well well you have a PDA and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . phd e: if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go . grad h:  for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , phd g: M right . grad h: right ? You have the phd g: I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and postdoc a: I like this PDA idea . professor b: where like one one button was \"  - oh \" and then another button was \" that 's great \" and another button \" that 's f \" phd g: Or like this is my \" I 'm supposed to do this \" kind of button , postdoc a: Yeah . phd g: Yeah something like that or postdoc a: And then grad h:  I think the CrossPad idea is a good one . grad h: It 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work .  that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me phd g: Yeah . grad h: and postdoc a: But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too , phd g: W postdoc a: doesn't it ?  grad h: Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard . postdoc a: But  , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition , right ? professor b: No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , postdoc a: OK . postdoc a: I I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a  professor b: Right . You don't have to phd e: The transfer function is less errorful , postdoc a: Oh , nicely put . phd g: Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , right ? That 's why we have this little I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and so if we don't have to return it and we can keep it for a year I don't know . grad h: Well w we don't we certainly don't have to return it , as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . The point is that we haven't used it at all and are we going to ? professor b: So we have no but  by I I would suggest you return one . phd g: We c professor b: We have some aspirations of using them phd g: One would probably be fine . professor b: and phd g: Maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool .  if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more professor b: Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed . grad h: although there is a little phd g: Well , I 'm yeah , that 's not a bad professor b: Yeah , yeah . phd g: Jeremy 's gonna be an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , which sounds funny but I think it should be cool , professor b: Yeah . phd g: You 're you 're gonna tease me ? grad h: Oh , equipment . grad h: And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion so that  the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field . professor b: You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding ? \" We ordered more wireless . \" It 's like wires are the things so you 're wiring you 're you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing . phd g: I just it 's sort of a anachronism ,  it 's like It 's great . professor b:  there 's there 's all this stuff going on  between  Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs   recognition runs , trying to figure things out about the features but it 's it 's all sort of in process , so there 's not much to say right now . grad h: So just the transcript number and then the then the phd e: This is Yes , this is number two for me today . professor b: See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the phd e: Oh . grad h: Should we do simultaneous ? phd g: Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? professor b: Yeah . phd g: You have to plug your ears , by the way  Eric , grad h: Well I have to , phd d: You don't have to "

        "Summary": "To ensure accuracy, a small percentage of transcripts will be modified to correct any misread or uncorrected digits. In order to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags, a speaker database will be compiled. The initial test set of digits has been completed, consisting of 4,000 lines with each line containing 1-10 digits. To explore different prosodic groupings of numbers, new digit forms were distributed. The group also discussed new naming conventions to facilitate the sorting process. In order to standardize file names, existing files will be modified to have equal lengths. Similar changes will be made to speaker identification tags. Additionally, files will include information specifying the channel, microphone, and broadcaster details. PhD F suggested recording different meetings with the same group to aid in tasks like summarization, while Professor D advocated for random meeting participants to ensure diversity for acoustical research purposes.",
        "Article": "phd a: Why is it so cold in here ? professor b: so , we haven't sent around the agenda . So , i  , any agenda items anybody has , wants to talk about , what 's going on ? postdoc g: I c I could talk about the meeting .  phd a: Well , I had a just a quick question but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed , but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker . professor b: OK , so let 's let 's So let 's just do agenda building right now . You were gonna starting to say something ? postdoc g: Well , you you , already know about the meeting that 's coming up and I don't know if if this is appropriate for this . phd e: What meeting ? professor b: We can so we can ta so n NIST is NIST folks are coming by next week postdoc g: OK . professor b: I think phd e: Who 's coming ? professor b: John Fiscus postdoc g: An - anything else , strike anybody ? phd a: we started running recognition on one conversation but it 's the r isn't working yet . phd e: Wha phd a: the main thing would be if anyone has , knowledge about ways to , post - process the wave forms that would give us better recognition , that would be helpful to know about . professor b: Yeah , so ,  phd e: What about , is there anything new with the speech , nonspeech stuff ? phd c: Yeah , we 're working more on it but , it 's not finished . postdoc g: I had thought under my topic that I would mention the , four items that I I , put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting , which includes like the pre - segmentation and the and the developments in multitrans . professor b: Alright , why don't we start off with this , u u I guess the order we brought them up seems fine . So the one issue was that the the , lapel mike , isn't as good as you would like . Right ? phd a: Ri -  , professor b: Is that is that basically the point ? phd a: yeah , the And actually in addition to that , that the the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal . And the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth ,  or and even on prosody , which Don is gonna be working on soon , it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar . phd a: So And I also talked to Mari this morning and she also had a strong preference for doing that . And in fact she said that that 's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too . Right , so one th grad h: Well , so professor b: well one thing I was gonna say was that , i we could get more , of the head mounted microphones even beyond the number of radio channels we have because I think whether it 's radio or wire is probably second - order . grad h: So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it . grad h: And then just sort of about , a thumb or a thumb and a half away from your from your mouth . phd a: But we have more than one type of professor b: How am I d phd a: for instance , you 're phd c: Yeah . phd a: But if we could actually standardize , you know , the the microphones , as much as possible that would be really helpful . professor b: Well ,  it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around , phd d: Yeah . professor b: so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of if this microphone seems OK to people , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things . grad h: Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , some of the Jimlets aren't working . grad h: And so , w  , I 've only been able to find three jacks that are working . phd e: Can we get these , wireless ? grad h: So professor b: No , but my point is phd a: But y we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting . professor b: R r right grad h: I I 'm not sure I 'm follow . Say that again ? professor b: Right now , we 've got , two microphones in the room , that are not quote - unquote standard . professor b: Also what we 've talked before about getting another , radio , grad h: Right . professor b: So ,  so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do , but have them all be the same mike . I think the original reason that it was done the other way was because , it w it was sort of an experimental thing and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or or , more uniformity , phd a: Right . phd a: Well , for short term research it 's just there 's just so much effort that would have to be done up front n  , professor b: Yeah . phd e: Is it because You you 're saying the for dialogue purposes , so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes ? Is that what you mean ? phd a: Well Jane would know more about the transcribers . postdoc g: a couple times , so , yeah , the transcribers notice And in fact there 're some where ,  ugh well ,  there 's it 's the double thing . postdoc g: And he 's always they always they just rave about how wonderful Adam 's Adam 's channel is .  , \" Baaah ! \" phd a: Even if if you 're talking on someone else 's mike it 's still you w postdoc g: Yeah , but  it 's not just that , it 's also you know you professor b: Yeah . postdoc g: It 's also like n no breathing , no You know , it 's like it 's it 's  , professor b: Yeah . postdoc g: it 's really it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view grad h: Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath . professor b: When we 're doing grad h: Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . professor b: Yeah , probably yeah , to the store we talked about and that grad h: Yep . postdoc g: And there was some talk about , maybe the h headphones that are uncomfortable for people , to grad h: Yep . So , as as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than than these things , which I think are horrible . grad h: And , you know , we 're researchers , so we all have big heads . OK , so , Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February and I 've spoken with , u u a lot of people here , not everyone .  , and , he expressed an interest in seeing the room and in , seeing a demonstration of the modified multitrans , which I 'll mention in a second , and also , he was interested in the pre - segmentation and then he 's also interested in the transcription conventions . postdoc g: And ,  So , it seems to me in terms of like , i i it wou You know , OK . So the room , it 's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room and how it how the recordings are done , and that kind of thing . OK , in terms of the multi - trans , well that that 's being modified by Dave Gelbart to , handle multi - channel recording . grad h: Oh , I should 've I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting . I I , @ @ didn't didn't see it , yesterday but I 'm going to see it today . And , that 's that will enable us to do nice  , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments . In terms of , like , pre - segmentation , that that continues to be , a terrific asset to the to the transcribers . What what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to include some information about which channel , there 's some speech in . I 'm just trying to do this by comparing energies ,  normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels . phd c: And so to to give the transcribers some information in which channel there 's there 's speech in addition to to the thing we we did now which is just , speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file . So I 'm I 'm relying on on the segmentation of the mixed file postdoc g: This is good . phd c: but I 'm I 'm trying to subdivide the speech portions into different portions if there is some activity in in different channels . postdoc g: Excellent , so this 'd be like w e providing also speaker ID potentially . professor b: something I guess I didn't put in the list but , on that , same day later on in or maybe it 's No , actually it 's this week , Dave Gelbart and I will be , visiting with John Canny who i you know , is a CS professor , postdoc g: Oh . You know , maybe they 'd wanna stick an array mike here when we 're doing things phd e: That would be cool . professor b: or or maybe it 's it 's not a specific array microphone they want phd d: Yeah . professor b: but they might wanna just , you know , you could imagine them taking the four signals from these these table mikes and trying to do something with them  , I also had a discussion So , w  , we 'll be over over there talking with him , after class on Friday . I had a , discussion today with , Birger Kollmeier who 's a , a German , scientist who 's got a fair sized group doing a range of things . But but , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and and , head models and microphone things . And so , he 's he and possibly a student , there w there 's , a student of his who gave a talk here last year , may come here , in the fall for , sort of a five month , sabbatical . phd e: That that reminds me , I had a a thought of an interesting project that somebody could try to do with the data from here , either using , you know , the the mikes on the table or using signal energies from the head worn mikes , phd d:   phd e: and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting , professor b: Right . phd e: And so you could plot out who was sitting next to who professor b: A little bit , phd e: and professor b: he didn't do a very extreme thing but just it was just sort of phd d: Yeah , yeah . professor b: e e given that , the the the block of wood with the the the two mikes on either side , grad h:   professor b: if I 'm speaking , or if you 're speaking , or someone over there is speaking , it if you look at cross - correlation functions , you end up with a phd d: Yeah . professor b: if if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you you get a big peak there . And if if someone 's talking on on on , one side or the other , it goes the other way . professor b: And then , it it it even looks different if th t if the two two people on either side are talking than if one in the middle . Well I was just thinking , you know , as I was sitting here next to Thilo that  , when he 's talking , my mike probably picks it up better than your guys 's mikes . phd e: So if you just looked at grad h: Oh , that 's another cl cue , phd d: Yeah . phd e: yeah , looked at the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who 's closest to who . professor b: Yeah , well you have to the appropriate normalizations are tricky , and and and are probably the key . phd a: You just search for Adam 's voice on each individual microphone , you pretty much know where everybody 's sitting . postdoc g: Can I ask one thing ?  , so , Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in , microphone arrays . postdoc g: is there  b And I also want to say , his he can't stay all day . He needs to  , leave for  , from here to make a two forty - five flight grad h: Oh , so just morning . postdoc g: So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight but do you think that ,  that , i John Canny should be involved in this somehow or not . professor b: Probably not but I I 'll I 'll I 'll know better after I see him this Friday what what kind of level he wants to get involved . professor b: he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to , or he might have no interest whatsoever . grad h: Is he involved in Ach ! I 'm blanking on the name of the project . NIST has has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and very elaborate software . Is is he the one working on that ? professor b: Well that 's what they 're starting up . professor b: well I think they 've instrumented a room but I don't think they they haven't started recordings yet . They don't have the phd e: Are they going to do video as well ? grad h:  . grad h: Oh , cuz what what I had read was , they had a  very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this , both in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff . professor b: All all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings . professor b: And one one notable difference u u actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not , but one one , difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes . The reason I didn't go for that here was because , the focus , both of my interest and of Adam 's interest was  , in impromptu situations . And we 're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations but that 's because it 's different to get data for research than to actually apply it . professor b: And so , for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it . But the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with , one or more other people i  , in in an p impromptu way , where you didn't didn't actually know what the situation was going to be . And therefore it would not it 'd be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with with some very carefully designed array of microphones . It was just , you know , yet another piece of research and it seemed like we had enough troubles just phd e: So there 's no like portable array of mikes ? professor b: No . So there 's there 's  , there 's a whole range of things there 's a whole array of things , that people do on this . professor b: So , the ,  the big arrays , places , like  , Rutgers , and Brown , and other other places , they have , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred hundred mikes or something . professor b: And it 's and , in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal - processing and they were gonna do the multi - channel stuff , but it d it d we ended up not doing it . grad h: And then they have little ones too professor b: And then they had the little ones , yeah . grad h: but  but they don't have our block of wood , right ? professor b: Yeah , our block of wood is unique . professor b: But the But the No , there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something phd a:   professor b: and and ,  So , yeah , there 's there 's there 's a range of things that people do . professor b: so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that 's that 's a good thing to do .  , whenever I 've described this to other people who are interested on the with the acoustic side that 's invariably the question they ask . Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask \"  , are you recording video ? \" phd a: Right , professor b: right ? phd a: right . professor b: And and the acoustic people will always say , \" well are you doing , array microphones ? \" So it 's it 's a good thing to do , but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined PDA that we have .  , I know that having an array of  , I would imagine it would be more expensive to have a an array of microphones . But couldn't you kind of approximate the natural sis situation by just shutting off  , channels when you 're later on ?  , it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just , you know , record them with an array and then just not use all the data ? grad h: It 's it 's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up . professor b: Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the postdoc g: OK . professor b: But if you get somebody who 's who who has that as a primary interest then that put then that drives it in that direction . grad h: That 's right ,  if someone if someone came in and said we really want to do it , phd a: Right . That would be fine , phd e: So to save that data you You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array ? grad h: Buy more disk space . professor b: But then , you know , there 's it there 's phd e: What you save , if you 're going to do research with it . yeah professor b: There 's I I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is . Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space . grad h: Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing . But I think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional . professor b: Right ? phd a: it seems professor b: So phd e: Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming . phd a: it seems to me that there 's you know , there are good political reasons for for doing this , just getting the data , because there 's a number of sites like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good , but they 'll be recording with video and they 'll be You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go since it 's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings , and just have this other information available . So , if we can get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure and then , I don't know , save it out or have whoever 's interested save that data out , transfer it there , it 'd be g it 'd be good to have have the recording . grad h: You mean to to actually get a microphone array and do that ? phd a: Well , if Even if we 're not grad h: And video and phd a: I 'm not sure about video . That 's sort of an video has a little different nature since right n right now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped .  , but it definitely in the case of microphone arrays , since if there was a community interested in this , then grad h: Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . professor b: See the problem is it it took , it took at least six months for Dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in in the microphones , and in the boxes . And so I think we could get a microphone array in here pretty easily and , have it mixed to to one channel of some sort . professor b: But , e I think for  , how we 're gonna decide For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that .  , you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can And to do that , it we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up , we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels and in this meeting , we 've got eight people and and six mikes . phd a: Well if there 's a way to say time to sort of solve each of these f those professor b: Yeah . phd a: So suppose you can get an array in because there 's some person at Berkeley who 's interested and has some equipment , and suppose we can as we save it we can , you know , transfer it off to some other place that that holds this this data , who 's interested , and even if ICSI it itself isn't .  , and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning , do we need to mix it with the rest ? I don't know . phd a:  it 's just it 's worth considering as sort of grad h: And y it 'd certainly gets skew . phd a: once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time , and and not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data . I mentioned that , b as a practical matter , grad h: Just professor b: but the real issue is that , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew . professor b: which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this . So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later , but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , phd a: I see . But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours which might be useful for for them . phd a: Right ,  at least they 'd have the data and the transcripts , professor b: And then we can offer up the room , phd a: and Right . professor b: Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space , and and yeah , the transcripts , and so on . phd a: But it 's if it 's impossible or if it 's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two , professor b: Well I thi phd a: so professor b: yeah , the thing will be , u u in in again , in talking to these other people to see what you know , what what we can do . phd e: Is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ?  professor b: Right , so we have we phd e:  grad h: Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem , that you have an infrastructure problem , you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped , and you have the problem that no one who 's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it . Internally , but I know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video . So it 's just postdoc g: Yeah , w although I m I I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , that i increase with video . There 's the fact that then  , if i I I 've heard comments about this before , \" why don't you just put on a video camera ? \" But you know , it 's sort of like saying , \"  , well we 're primarily interested in in some dialogue things , but , why don't we just throw a microphone out there . \"  , the thing is , once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in . professor b: So I think NIST or LDC , or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that . postdoc g: I it it occurred to me , has Don signed a human subject 's form ? grad h: Oh ! Probably not . postdoc g: A permission form ? grad h: Has Don have you s did you si I thought you did actually . grad h: Didn't you read a digit string ? phd e: You were here at a meeting before . postdoc g: Did you sign a form ? grad f: Did I ? I don't know . professor b: Yeah , we we postdoc g: But I just grad f: Can I verbally consent ? postdoc g: you know . You 're on recor you 're being recorded postdoc g: o grad f: Yeah . phd a: and professor b: we don't we don't perform electro - shock during these meetings , grad f: I don't care . phd e: How big is the data set ? postdoc g: Oh , it 's what  is one meeting . I didn't want to have any conflicts of , you know , of of when to stop transcribing this one or So I wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose , and and and so phd e:  - huh . postdoc g: And , meetings , you know , I think that they 're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases . So , you know , that means you know , if we 've got two already finished and they 're working on  , right now all eight of them have differe  , additional data sets . postdoc g: And , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the ,  the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps . But , just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set .  , these still , when they 're finished , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . They still need to be edited and all but But it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned . OK , now I wanted to mention the , teleconference I had with , Jonathan Fiscus . postdoc g: He , he in indicated to me that they 've that he 's been , looking , spending a lot of time with I 'm not quite sure the connection , but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system . But it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed for the annotated graphs approach . postdoc g: So what he wants me to do and what we what we will do and  , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting for him to be able to experiment with in this ATLAS System . And they do have some sort of software , at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS and that he wants to experiment with taking our data and putting them in that format , and see how that works out . I I I explained to him in in detail the , conventions that we 're using here in this in this word level transcript . And , you know , I I explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately and and the focus on reliability . He 's he 's very  , independently he asked , \" well what about reliability ? \" So , he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing . OK ,  phd a: Sorry , can you explain what the ATLAS I 'm not familiar with this ATLAS system . postdoc g: Well , you know , at this point I think  , well Adam 's read more in more detail than I have on this . But , there there is a way of viewing  , whenever you have coding categories , and you 're dealing with  , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that that have alternative , choices that you could use for each each of them . grad h: Is is Is ATLAS the his annotated transcription graph stuff ? I don't remember the acronym . The the one the what I think you 're referring to , they they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation . grad h: And that 's basically what I based the format that I did I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff . And so it 's it 's a data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types . phd e: Is this the project that 's sort of , between , NIST and and , a couple of other places ? postdoc g:   And I looked through them and they mainly had to do with this , this , tree structure , annotated tree diagram thing . postdoc g: So ,  and , you know , in terms of like the conventions that I 'm a that I 've adopted , it there there 's no conflict at all . And , \" oh , and how 'd you handle this ? \" And I said , \" well , you know , this way \" and And and we had a really nice conversation .  , OK , now I also wanted to say in a different a different direction is , Brian Kingsbury . I told him he could SSH on and use multi - trans , and have a look at the already done , transcription . And what he said was that , what they 'll be providing is will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information . And , that 's ,  You know , I need to get back to him and and , you know , explore that a little bit more and see what they 'll be giving us in specific , phd a:  . phd e: The p the people postdoc g: but I just haven't had time yet . phd e: The the folks that they 're , subcontracting out the transcription to , are they like court reporters postdoc g: Sorry , what ? Yes . phd e: or postdoc g: Apparently Well , I get the sense they 're kind of like that . Like it 's like a pool of of somewhat  , secretarial I don't think that they 're court reporters . Like medical transcriptionist type people grad h: Nu - it 's mostly it 's for their speech recognition products , phd e: But aren't they 're postdoc g: Yep . grad h: Well they they do send it out but my understanding is that that 's all this company does is transcriptions for IBM for their speech product . grad h: So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that . postdoc g: Up to now it 's been monologues , as far my understood . postdoc g: Brian himself downloaded So So , Adam sent them a CD and Brian himself downloaded  , cuz , you know , we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f terms with what they wanted to do . postdoc g: And then what he 's going to do is check it , a before they go be beyond the first one . professor b: So if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go phd e: OK . grad h: Well , but that 's OK , because , you know , you 'll do all them and then combine them . phd e: Well if you 're tran if you got that channel right there postdoc g: d  , in my case phd c: Yeah . postdoc g: Yeah , I I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with Yeah . phd a: I I think it 's sort of hard just playing the you know , just having played the individual files . phd a: there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before . phd e: Yeah , that 's phd a: it sort of depends where you are in postdoc g: And especially since a lot of these phd d: Yeah . grad h: And the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways . postdoc g: Well , except I can say that my transcribers use the mixed signal mostly grad h: So . postdoc g: unless there 's a huge disparity in terms of the volume on on the mix . In which case , you know , they they wouldn't be able to catch anything except the prominent channel , grad h: Right . postdoc g: Yeah , well phd a: Actually , are th so are they giving any time markings ? grad h: Right . phd a: In other words , if postdoc g: Well , I have to ask him . postdoc g: But but the ,  I did want to say that it 's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people , and if you 're dealing furthermore with highly abstract network concepts you 've never heard of So , you know , one of these people was was transcribing the , networks group talk and she said , \" I don't really know what a lot of these abbreviations are , \" \" but I just put them in parentheses cuz that 's the that 's the convention and I just \" Cuz you know , if you don't know grad h: Oh , I 'd be curious to to look at that . grad h: The networks group meetings are all phd e: Given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have I B M doing it ? Why not just do it all ourselves ? professor b: it 's historical .  , some point ago we thought that  , it \" boy , we 'd really have to ramp up to do that \" , phd c:  - huh . phd d: No , just professor b: you know , like we just did , and , here 's , a a , collaborating institution that 's volunteered to do it . professor b: And it still might be a good thing phd e: I 'm just wondering now phd a: Actu yeah , Mar - Mari asked me the same question as sort of professor b: but phd e: Well , I 'm I 'm wondering now if it 's grad h: Well we can talk about more details later . Let 's see what comes out of it , and and , you know , have some more discussions with them . It 's very a real benefit having Brian involved because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format . grad h: So , Liz , with with the SRI recognizer , can it make use of some time marks ? phd a: OK , so this is a , grad h: I I guess I don't know what that means . phd a: and actually I should say this is what Don has b  , he 's already been really helpful in , chopping up these So so first of all you  , for the SRI front - end , we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge .  , but second of all ,  in general because some of these channels , I 'd say , like , I don't know , at least half of them probably on average are g are ha are have a lot of cross - ta sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk .  , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition , especially forced alignment . So , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's first the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed which we did have some problems with , and Thilo , I think told me why this was , but that people were switching microphones around in the very beginning , so the SRI re phd c: No , th Yeah . They they were not switching them but what they were they were adjusting them , phd a: and they They were not phd c: so . phd a: So we have to sort of normalize the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments . phd a: So we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your your , cuts that you made on the mixed signal . Right ? phd a: the problem is if we have no time marks , then for forced alignment we actually don't know where you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word . And so grad h: Oh , I see , phd a: if if it 's a whole conversation and we get a long , you know , par paragraph of of talk , grad h: it 's for the length . phd a: And , I think with phd e: Well you would need to like a forced alignment before you did the chopping , right ? phd a: No , we used the fact that So when Jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this , whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not , grad h: It 's already chunked . And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary . That 's great , cuz the recognizer can grad h: it 's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also . phd a: Right , and it it helps that it 's made based on sort of heuristics and human ear I think . phd a: Th - but there 's going to be a real problem , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were , which segment they belonged to . phd e: Why not do a a a forced alignment ? grad h: That 's what she 's saying , is that you can't . phd a: If you do a forced alignment on something really grad h: Got  six sixty minutes of phd a: well even if you do it on something really long you need to know you can always chop it up but you need to have a reference of which words went with which , chop . postdoc g: Now wasn't I thought that one of the proposals was that IBM was going to do an initial forced alignment , phd a: So postdoc g: after they grad h: Yeah , but professor b: I I think that they are , grad h: We 'll have to talk to Brian . professor b: yeah , I 'm sure they will and so we we have to have a dialogue with them about it . professor b: it sounds like Liz has some concerns phd a: Maybe they have some you know , maybe actually there is some , even if they 're not fine grained , maybe the transcribers professor b: and phd a: I don't know , maybe it 's saved out in pieces or or something . postdoc g: I just you know , it 's like I got over - taxed with the timing . But the it is true that the segments I haven't tried the segments that Thilo gave you but the segments that in your first meeting are great . phd a: Right , cuz postdoc g: Well , I I was thinking it would be fun to to  , if if you wouldn't mind , to give us a pre - segmentation . postdoc g: maybe you have one already of that first m of the meeting that  , the first transcribed meeting , the one that I transcribed . phd c: I 'm sure I have some postdoc g: Do you have a could you generate a pre - segmentation ? grad h: February sixteenth I think . phd c: but but that 's the one where we 're , trai training on , so that 's a little bit grad h: Oh . phd c: It 's a little bit at odd to postdoc g: Oh , darn . phd a: And actually as you get transcripts just , for new meetings , we can try postdoc g:  - huh . So it 'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers , just to sort of we 're playing around with sort of  , parameters f on the recognizer , postdoc g:   phd a: The first meeting had I think just four people , phd c: Four speakers , yeah . postdoc g: Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday and and I and I was planning to do just a a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you . I guess the other thing , I I can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but , I know you and I talked about this a little bit , there was an issue of , suppose we get in the , I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain , where we we , we have all the data transcribed and we have these transcribers and we were we 're the we 're still a bit slow on feeding at that point we 've caught up and the the the , the weak link is is recording meetings . OK , two questions come , is you know what how how do we  , it 's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't reached that point but how do we step out the recorded meetings ? And the other one is , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ? So , I I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting but there was grad h: We had spoken with them about it . postdoc g: And there is one use that that also we discussed which was when , Dave finishes the and maybe it 's already finished the the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps .  , then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps . It 's just a matter of , you know , providing So if right now you have two overlapping segments in the same time bin , well with with the improvement in the database in in the , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the  , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of of each segment . professor b: One one was  , we had s had some discussion in the past about some very high level labelings , postdoc g: Yeah . The types of overlaps professor b: types of overlaps , and so forth that that someone could do . And the third one is is , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have which is that , if ,  if we have time and people are able to do it , to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech . For instance , marking in some overlapping potentially overlapping fashion , the value of , ar articulatory features . professor b: You know , just sort of say , OK , it 's voiced from here to here , there 's it 's nasal from here to here , and so forth .  , as opposed to doing phonetic  , you know , phonemic and the phonetic analysis , grad h:  professor b: and , assuming , articulatory feature values for those those things . postdoc g: Also if you 're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels , wouldn't it ?  , I would think that that , being able to code that there 's a a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was . professor b: but I think also it 's just the issue that that when you look at the u w u u when you look at Switchboard for instance very close up there are places where whether it 's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone postdoc g:   grad h: Yeah , but but just saying what the professor b: because it 's you know , there 's this movement from here to here postdoc g: Yeah , I 'm sure . professor b: and and and it 's so I phd e: You 're saying r sort of remove the high level constraints and go bottom - up . Maybe there 's there 's even a better way to do it but it but but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things , phd e:   professor b: and  , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to postdoc g: That 's nice . professor b: some sort of categories but but something that allows for overlapping change of these things and then this would give some more ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes , different timing changes as opposed to just \" click , you 're now in this state , which corresponds to this speech sound \" and so on . phd a: So this is like gestural  , these g professor b: Yeah , something like that . professor b: actually if we get into that it might be good to , haul John Ohala into this phd a: Right . phd a: But is is the goal there to have this on meeting data , postdoc g: Excellent . phd a: like so that you can do far field studies of those gestures or  , or is it because you think there 's a different kind of actual production in meetings that people use ? Or ? professor b: No , I think I think it 's for for for that purpose I 'm just viewing meetings as being a a neat way to get people talking naturally . And then you have i and then and then it 's natural in all senses , phd e: Just a source of data ? phd a: I see . professor b: in the sense that you have microphones that are at a distance that you know , one might have , and you have the close mikes , and you have people talking naturally . And the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally , phd a:  - huh . professor b: right ? So so I think that given that it 's that kind of corpus , phd d: Yeah . professor b: if it 's gonna be a very useful corpus  , if you say w OK , we 've limited the use by some of our , censored choices , we don't have the video , we don't and so forth , but there 's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices . professor b: And , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level , and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others . professor b: people have made a lot of use of of TIMIT and ,  w due to its markings , and then the Switchboard transcription thing , well I think has been very useful for a lot of people . professor b: So phd a: I guess I wanted to , sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings . phd a: I actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore and I think they 've what , vehemently said no before but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know , \" well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow professor b: Yeah . Go to their meeting tomorrow and see if we can try , to convince them postdoc g:   professor b: Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings , phd a: because they have And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of of talk than we have here professor b: right ? postdoc g:    phd e: You mean in terms of the topic topics ? phd a: Well , yes and in terms of the the fact that they 're describing abstract things and , just dialogue - wise , professor b:   And then the other thing is , I don't know if this is at all useful , but I asked Lila if I can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building to see if there 's any groups that , for a free lunch , professor b: Yes . grad h: You mean non - ICSI ? phd a: non - ICSI , non - academic , grad h: Yeah , I guess you you can try phd a: you know , like government people , grad h: but phd a: I don't know .  , it seems like we we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches grad h: Well , tha I think that 's her point . phd a: Right , and then we could also we might try advertising again because I think it 'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings postdoc g: Yeah . phd e: Does does John Ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings ? postdoc g:   grad h: And I think , if we could get phd a: So I actually wrote to him and he answered , \" great , that sounds really interesting \" . grad h: But , it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording phd a: So grad h: so u I didn't have to do it each time . phd a: and I was thinking professor b: He - he 's supposed he 's supposed to be trained to do it .  , the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging , grad h: It 's not that hard . phd a: disfluency tagging , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y working on for language modeling . So if you wanna process a utterance and the first thing they say is , \" well \" , and that \" well \" is coded as some kind of interrupt u tag .  , and things like that , th postdoc g: Of course some of that can be li done lexically . phd a: A lot of it can be done postdoc g: And I also they are doing disfluency tagging to some degree already . phd a: I think there 's a second pass and I don't really know what would exist in it . But there 's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of , you know , is it a question or not , postdoc g:   postdoc g: I wanted to whi while we 're  , so , to return just briefly to this question of more meeting data ,  I have two questions . One of them is , Jerry Feldman 's group , they they , are they I know that they recorded one meeting . professor b: I think there 's we should go beyond , ICSI but , there 's a lot of stuff happening at ICSI that we 're not getting now that we could . So th there was the thing in Fillmore 's group but even there he hadn't What he 'd said \" no \" to was for the main meeting . phd e: Well , and and the other thing too is when they originally said \" no \" they didn't know about this post - editing capability thing . professor b: there 's there 's , the networks group , I don't Do they still meeting regularly or ? grad h: Well , I don't know if they meet regularly or not but they are no longer recording . professor b: But  , ha ha have they said they don't want to anymore or ? grad h: ugh , what was his name ? professor b: i i postdoc g: Joe Sokol ? grad h: Yeah . professor b: OK , so they 're down to three or four people grad h: They and they stopped Yeah . postdoc g: We might be able to get the administration grad h: Well he was sort of my contact , so I just need to find out who 's running it now . phd a: Yeah , it One thing that would be nice postdoc g: I don't know phd a: and this it sounds bizarre but , I 'd really like to look at to get some meetings where there 's a little bit of heated discussion , like ar arguments and or emotion , and things like that . Some group , \" yes , we must \" grad h: Who 's willing to get recorded and distributed ? phd a: Well , you know , something phd c: Yeah . grad f: Yeah , I don't think the more political argumentative ones would be willing to phd a:  professor b: Yeah , with with with potential use from the defense department . phd a: No , but maybe stu student , groups or , film - makers , or som Something a little bit colorful . Yeah , th there 's a problem there in terms of , the  commercial value of of st  , postdoc g: Yeah , of course there is this problem though , that if we give them the chance to excise later we e might end up with like five minutes out of a f of m one hour phd d: Film - maker . phd a: And I don't mean that they 're angry phd d: Is postdoc g: of Yes . phd a: but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat . So if anyone has ideas , I 'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people but I don't really know which groups are worth pursuing . postdoc g: Well there was this K P F A grad h: No that 's postdoc g: but OK . phd a: Or postdoc g: And I had one other one other aspect of this which is , Jonathan Fiscus expressed primar  y a major interest in having meetings which were all English speakers . phd e: Did he mean ,  did he mean and non - British ? grad h: Well phd c: The all native . phd e: He said British was OK ? postdoc g: But but Sure , sure , sure . professor b: Why ? grad h: British is English ? phd c:  postdoc g: Yeah . professor b: Well , I don't I don't I don't think if he didn't say that postdoc g: Native speaking . grad h: So , why would he care ? phd e: Knowing the application phd a: That 's professor b: I remember wh I I remember a study phd a: I was thinking , knowing the , n National Institute of Standards , it is all professor b: I remember a study that BBN did where they trained on this was in Wall Street Journal days or something , they trained on American English and then they tested on , different native speakers from different areas . professor b: it was Swiss w Yeah , so it 's so I think , you know , if he 's if he 's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I I I think he would probably want ,  American English , postdoc g: All America , OK . It it yeah , unless we 're gonna train with a whole bunch of postdoc g: I think that the Feldman 's meetings tend to be more that way , aren't they ?  , I sort of feel like they have professor b: I think so , grad h: Maybe . grad h: And maybe there are a few of with us where it was professor b: Yeah . grad h: you know , Dan wasn't there and before Jose started coming , professor b: Yeah . professor b: So , what about what about people who involved in some artistic endeavor ? phd d: Yeah . phd a: Exactly , that 's what I was professor b: You 'd think like they would be phd d: A film - maker . phd a: something where there there is actually discussion where there 's no right or wrong answer but but it 's a matter of opinion kind of thing . phd a: Yeah , we could phd e: A any department that calls itself science phd d: Department . phd d: Computer sci grad h: That postdoc g: We could get Julia Child . phd a: I 'm I 'm actually serious grad h: That 's phd a: because , you know , we have the set up here grad h: Got a ticket . grad f: I know grad h: I could phd a: Not not professor b: Put a little ad up saying , \" come here and argue \" . grad h: and they they they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech . grad h: But when they lost interest in speech they also stopped answering my email about other stuff , so . phd a: Or people who are really h professor b: They could have a discussion about te grad f: I grad h: We should probably bleep that out . grad f: I heard that at Cal Tech they have a special room someone said that they had a special room to get all your frustrations out that you can go to and like throw things and break things . professor b: Yeah , now that is not actually what we grad f: So we can like post a grad h: Th - that 's not what we want . grad f: No , not to that extent phd a: Well , far field mikes can pick up where they threw stuff on the wall . professor b: Yeah , but we don't want them to throw the far field mikes is the thing . postdoc g: It 'd be fun to get like a a p visit from the grad h: There was a dorm room at Tech that , someone had coated the walls and the ceiling , and , the floor with mattresses . professor b: What did we mean by that ? Remember @ @ ? grad h: Liz wanted to talk about methods of improving accuracy by doing pre - processing . phd a: Well I think that that was just sort of I I already asked Thilo professor b: Oh , you already did that . phd a: but that , it would be helpful if I can stay in the loop somehow with , people who are doing any kind of post - processing , whether it 's to separate speakers or to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , or both , that we can sort of try out as we 're running recognition .  , so , i is that Who else is work I guess Dan Ellis and you phd c: Dan , yeah . professor b: he 's he 's interested in in fact we 're look starting to look at some echo cancellation kind of things . professor b: Which  grad h: I am not sure how much that 's an issue with the close talking mikes , professor b:  ? grad h: but who knows ? professor b: Well , let 's w i isn't that what what you want phd a: I don't know . I 'm bad professor b: t No , so No , i w wha what you what you want when you 're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better . professor b: And the question is to w to what extent is it getting hurt by ,  by any room acoustics or is it just  , given that it 's close it 's not a problem ? phd a: It doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear professor b:  phd a: but I 'm not an expert . grad h: e I bet with the lapel mike there 's plenty , room acoustic phd a: That that may be true . phd a: But I don't know how good it can get either by those the those methods grad h: Yeah . grad h: So I I think it 's just , phd a: Oh , I don't know . phd a: All I meant is just that as sort of as this pipeline of research is going on we 're also experimenting with different ASR , techniques . phd e: So the problem is like , on the microphone of somebody who 's not talking they 're picking up signals from other people and that 's causing problems ? phd a: R right , although if they 're not talking , using the the inhouse transcriptions , were sort of O K because the t no one transcribed any words there and we throw it out . phd a: But if they 're talking at all and they 're not talking the whole time , so you get some speech and then a \"  -  \" , and some more speech , so that whole thing is one chunk . And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it , that 's where it 's a big problem . postdoc g: You know , this does like seem like it would relate to some of what Jose 's been working on as well , the encoding of the phd d: Yeah . postdoc g: And and he also , he was phd a: The energy , phd d: Yeah , phd a: right . postdoc g: I was t I was trying to remember , you have this interface where you i you ha you showed us one time on your laptop that you you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events . Because , eh , it 's possible , eh , eh , in a simp sample view , to , nnn , to compare with c with the segment , the the kind of assessment what happened with the the different parameters . And only with a different bands of color for the , few situation , eh , I consider for acoustic event is enough to @ @ . phd d: I I I see that , eh , you are considering now , eh , a very sophisticated , eh , ehm , eh , @ @ set of , eh , graphic s eh , eh , ehm , si symbols to to transcribe . No ? Because , before , you you are talking about the the possibility to include in the Transcriber program eh , a set of symbols , of graphic symbol to t to mark the different situations during the transcription postdoc g: Oh , I w  - huh . No ? postdoc g: Well , you 're saying So , symbols for differences between laugh , and sigh , and and and slam the door and stuff ? phd d: Yeah . postdoc g: Or some other kind of thing ? phd d: No ? To to mark postdoc g: Well , I wouldn't say symbols so much . The the main change that I that I see in the interface is is just that we 'll be able to more finely c  , time things . postdoc g: But I I also st there was another aspect of your work that I was thinking about when I was talking to you phd a:  . postdoc g: which is that it sounded to me , Liz , as though you and , maybe I didn't q understand this , but it sounded to me as though part of the analysis that you 're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together . postdoc g: And th so if you have like a p a s you know , speech from one speaker , then you cut out the part that 's not that speaker , phd a:   postdoc g: and you combine segments from that same speaker to and run them through the recognizer . Is that right ? phd a: Well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker , postdoc g:   phd a: because then we we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries , because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features . phd a: And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have .  , so , you know , that that it would help to have either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio , postdoc g:   phd a: which I don't know how possible this is for the lapel , or to have very to have closer , time you know , synch times , basically , around the speech that gets transcribed in it , or both . So I just wanted to see , you know , on the transcribing end from here things look good . And then the issue of like global processing of some signal and then , you know , before we chop it up is is yet another way we can improve things in that . You can ,   The problem is just that the acoustic when the signal - to - noise ratio is too low , you you 'll get , a  an alignment with the wrong duration pattern or it phd e: Oh , so that 's the problem , is the the signal - to - noise ratio . It 's not the fact that you have like  , what he did is allow you to have , words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations . phd a: Right , things things near the boundaries where if you got your alignment wrong phd e:   It 's that there are problems even in inside the alignments , because of the fact that there 's enough acoustic signal there t for the recognizer to to eat , as part of a word . So , yeah , bottom bottom line is just I wanted to make sure I can be aware of whoever 's working on these signal - processing techniques for , detecting energies , phd d: Yeah . professor b: O K ,  tea has started out there I suggest we c run through our digits and , postdoc g: OK "

        "Query": "Which groups were thanked for their efforts and discussed as being heavily impacted?",
        "Summary": "In recognition of their life-saving efforts during the ongoing pandemic, essential workers were thanked, particularly during Paramedic Services Week. Additionally, members voiced their support for various marginalized groups, including advocating for aboriginals facing police brutality, students experiencing disrupted education, indigenous and rural residents lacking internet access, and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): We'll call this meeting to order. Welcome to the fifth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Pursuant to the order passed on Monday, April20, the committee is meeting today to consider ministerial announcements, to allow members of the committee to present petitions, and to question ministers, including the Prime Minister, about the COVID-19 pandemic. Tomorrow, May8, Dr.AndreaMcCrady, Dominion Carillonneur, will give a special recital to mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Victory in Europe Day, VE Day, commemorates the formal acceptance of Germany's surrender by allied forces at the end of the Second World War. While the pandemic prevents us from gathering to celebrate in person, tomorrow at noon the voice of our nation will ring out in remembrance of this milestone in our history. Just so you are aware, the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee. I would like to remind members that, as in the House of Commons or committee, they should not take photos of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of the interpreters and to allow the meeting to proceed smoothly, I would ask you to follow some instructions. When you are ready to speak, click on the microphone icon to activate your microphone, or hold the space bar down while you are speaking. If you release the bar, your microphone will revert to mute, just like a walkie-talkie. Honourable members, I would like to remind you that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should you need to request the floor outside of your designated speaking time, you should activate your mike and state that you have a point of order. If a member of the committee wishes to intervene on a point of order raised by another person, you should use the raised hand function to indicate to the chair that you wish to speak. Should any technical challenges arise, for example, in relation to interpretation, please advise the chair immediately by raising a point of order, and the technical team will work on resolving them. If you get accidentally disconnected, please try to rejoin the meeting with the information you used to join initially. Before we get started, please note that in the top right-hand corner of your screen is a button that you can use to change views. Speaker view allows you to focus on the person currently speaking; gallery view allows you to see a larger number of participants. You can click through the multiple pages in the gallery view to see who is on and how many more participants there are. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. In addition, to ensure a petition is considered properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for a petition certified in a previous Parliament should be mailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. Chair, five years ago when Parliament passed Bill C-14, then justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said that it represented a finely tuned balance between access and safeguards. Petitioners on the first petition I'm presenting are very concerned to see Bill C-7 before Parliament, which removes safeguards ahead of that five-year review. Petitioners specifically mention their concerns about the removal of the mandatory 10-day reflection period, which can already be waived in certain circumstances. They are concerned about reducing the number of witnesses required to oversee it and ensure that a request has been properly made. The second and final petition that I will be presenting today is with respect to Senate Bill S-204. This would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who did not consent. This responds specifically to concerns about organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China involving Falun Gong practitioners and increasing concerns that this is being or about to be applied to Uighurs as well. Petitioners are noting that in the previous Parliament there were bills on this, Bill C-350 and Bill S-240. Now, in this Parliament there is a bill, Bill S-204, and the petitioners hope that this 43rd Parliament will be the one that gets it passed. This is my first occasion to present a petition in our virtual format of the COVID-19 committee. The petition I am presenting today, which was previously approved, is from a number of constituents who are concerned that we pursue the Paris Agreement to hold the global average temperature increase to no more than 1.5C. The Paris Agreement itself embeds in it the concept of Just Transition with a capital J and a capital T, the concept of just transition ensuring fairness and support for all workers in the fossil fuel sector. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to move forward with an act to ensure just transition and to ensure adequate funding so that workers and communities dependent on the fossil fuel sector receive meaningful support to ensure security in their lives in the transition to more sustainable energy use. I want to thank the honourable members for their usual collaboration and now we'll go on to mr. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): On a point of order, Mr. Chair, on Tuesday, at our COVID-19 committee of the whole meeting, I was asking a question which started at 12:56:06 and was cut off at 1:00:32, so I still have 34 seconds of time remaining in my question time of five minutes. If you believe that my time was unjustly cut off and that it was unfair treatment of the official opposition when we were raising our points of order, I would ask that the 34 seconds be tacked on to the opening round for the opposition and credited to Rosemarie Falk, who will be leading off for the Conservatives. the chair: Normally what happens is the chair uses judgment, and with 35 seconds, there isn't enough time obviously for a full question or answer, most of the time. I want everyone to know that I do have a timer next to me and I am timing the questions, and I will be treating the answers the same way. We've taken a little bit of the chair's ability to give judgment on it, but it will be from now on. I would like to remind the honourable members that no member will be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. Will the Prime Minister stand up for Canada's energy workers, or does he agree with the fringe left and those who want to destroy our country? ms. Chair, I believe that the language that the honourable member just used is unparliamentary mr. It is unacceptable to assert that anyone who wants to make a point about our economy is trying to destroy the country. As I pointed out this morning in my press conference, we cannot move forward on a transformation of our energy sector without supporting the workers in that energy sector. We need their innovation and we need their hard work if we are going to lower our emissions, if we are going to reach our the chair: We'll go to Ms. Chair, it has been 43 days since the finance minister promised Canada's energy sector liquidity through the Business Development Bank of Canada. If the government doesn't step up to support our energy sector, they are in effect doubling down on their support for foreign, unethically sourced oil. Chair, when will the credit options be available to Canada's small and medium energy firms? the chair: I want to remind honourable members that we do have interpreters who are listening and translating. Chair, from the very beginning, our priority through this pandemic and this crisis has been to support workers across the country. We have sent billions of dollars to workers right across the country, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, B.C., and Newfoundland and Labrador in the energy sector for them to be able to support their families through this difficult time. The announcements to date fall well short of what is needed to maintain a steady supply of affordable and healthy food. Instead of responding to specific COVID-19 challenges, our farmers are facing the Liberals' reannounced $125 million that was already budgeted in the AgriRecovery program. Will the Prime Minister finally step up and take our food supply chain seriously, or is agriculture just an afterthought for him? right hon. Chair, we take agriculture and our agricultural sector extremely seriously, which is why we announced hundreds of millions of dollars a couple of days ago to respond to pressing needs. We will continue to make investments to ensure both the safety of workers in our agricultural sector and the safety of our communities, as well as the continued flow of high-quality Canadian food onto our tables right across the country. Our farmers are faced with rising operational costs, a disrupted service industry, labour shortages and a reduced capacity at processing plants. When will the Prime Minister deliver adequate support to address the critical changes facing our ag industry? right hon. Chair, I would suggest respectfully that the honourable member take a look once again at the announcement we made, which actually highlights significant new investments to support our agricultural industry. Every step of the way in this unprecedented situation, we've been moving forward on doing more, on adjusting and on investing more. We need to support our agricultural sector and the people who work so hard to put food on Canadians' tables right across the country and we will continue to. Chair, Canadians expect to find healthy and affordable food at their grocery stores, but if the government does not take action now, that's not a given. It is an enormous hit to their bottom line, and the recent carbon tax hike is taking even more money out of the pockets of farmers at a time when they can afford it the least. Will the Prime Minister exempt all farm operations from the carbon tax and reimburse the money that they have already taken from them? right hon. Chair, it's a shame to hear the member opposite accidentallyunintentionally, I'm certainmislead the House and Canadians. This is the way of creating a better future for our kids and grandkids, which I know people in communities right across the country, including our farm communities, want to see happen. We are moving forward in a responsible way to put a price on pollution and put more money in average Canadians' pockets. marilne gill (manicouagan, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I am thinking about the lobster fishery in the Magdalen Islands, the crab fishery on the Cte-Nord or those fishing for herring in the south of the Gasp. Because imports have ceased, because the domestic market is weak and in decline because of the interruption of the tourism and restaurant industries, the fishing industry and its fishers must be supported. justin trudeau: Our fishers do exceptional work that is extremely important in feeding Canadians and in contributing to our economic success through their exports around the world. I know about the processing industry and the $62.5million to be used essentially for freezing products, but I am talking about the fishers themselves. In addition, they feel that they will be losing money, because of the drop in the price of their resource. They are just as essential as farmers, but they are going to have to work at a loss and they are not going to have workers to assist them. Are you going to do anything else, in addition to the assistance of $62.5million? Time is of the essence. We recognize the challenges that fishers must face in terms of social distancing and of work that is often seasonal. We are going to continue working with the industry, with the fishers, and with the coastal communities in order to ensure that people have confidence in their abilities and in their future. In times of crisis, it is important for the government to be there to support people, and that is exactly what we are going to continue to do. But, given the cyclical nature of the industry, some sectors have had to postpone for several weeks the preparations they need for fishing activities. The current program could be modified in a number of ways, to accommodate the cycle, the dates, and the size of the companies. They would really like to take advantage of the $40,000loan, but they cannot because of their payroll. I can already suggest a number of solutions to the government and to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, that would bring help to those businesses very quickly. The fishers carry on, because it is a duty for them, because they want to help us and to be part of the effort at this time of crisis. I would really like to hear a guarantee that they will be supported, that they will be able to put food on the table this year, and that they will be able to support the communities that often depend on the fishing industry, a major industry in those communities. justin trudeau: Minister Jordan has been working with the fishers, the fishing industry and the communities affected by the crisis since the crisis began. From the outset, our priority has been to support the millions of Canadians from coast to coast who have lost their jobs. We have been able to do so, but we are going to continue to work for those who must now face difficulties. the chair: Before we move to the next question, I would like to remind members of the committee to speak slowly, and to address their remarks to the chair and not directly to each other. They've seen revenues plummet, and at the same time the cost of delivering municipal services has risen. As the Prime Minister knows, municipalities are unable to run deficits and so they are facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that Canadians depend on. They're going to be even more important during the recovery, especially when it comes to delivering on the infrastructure programs before us. My question for the Prime Minister is, when can they expect federal financial support to arrive? right hon. Chair, no government in Canada's history has done more to work with our municipalities, with our cities, with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to respond to the challenges they're facing and to partner with them. Things from infrastructure to investments have made a huge difference right across the country in the quality of life of Canadians in towns, large and small, from coast to coast to coast. As I'm sure the member well knows, our Constitution requires that most of the funding for municipalities flow through the provinces. We are working with the provinces, as we continue to work with the cities, to ensure that we're able to support this order of government that delivers the vast majority of services to Canadians with very little financial means. Chair, it would seem that the federal government has the fiscal capacity and the responsibility to help municipalities weather this crisis. Transit systems have been hit particularly hard and have seen the bulk of the layoffs in the municipal sector. These transit services carry essential workers to work, whether they are health care workers, grocery store workers, janitors or others. We will see service cutbacks precisely at a time when we want to be expanding transit and improving transit in our communities. Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that the federal government needs to step in to safeguard and protect Canada's transit services? right hon. Chair, this federal government recognizes how important it is to support all Canadians, which is why we put forward unprecedented measures to help millions upon millions of Canadians with the CERB and with the wage subsidy. I'll be having a conversation with all other first ministers tonight to talk about a broad range of issues. We have continued to engage with them, but again, it is important to respect the Constitution and understand that funding for municipalities and cities does go through the provinces. The federal government is happy to be there to support, but it must be the chair: We will go to Mr. Chair, I am wondering how the Prime Minister could explain to a bus driver in Vancouver who has been laid off that as a public sector worker, she can't access the federal wage subsidy, while an equivalent worker in the airline industry gets to keep her job with the federal help of that program. Chair, I'm happy to explain to the member and to all Canadians that our Constitution creates federal areas of jurisdiction and provincial areas of jurisdiction. The airline industry, like banking, like telecommunications, is a federal area of jurisdiction that we have been able to move forward on. More than that, we brought the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy to all industries across this country, because we knew that as the federal government, it was something that we needed to step up on the chair: We will go back to Mr. Faced with minimal health care capacity, remote indigenous communities in my riding are taking matters into their own hands. The Nuxalk have put up a checkpoint on Highway 20 to protect community members and prevent non-essential travel. In particular, it is to protect the three remaining fluent speakers of the Nuxalk language, these cherished elders in their community. The Haida on Haida Gwaii have set up a similar checkpoint, as have communities throughout British Columbia, yet federal support for indigenous communities amounts to only $39 million for all of the indigenous communities in B.C. Does the Prime Minister not agree that more support is warranted to help indigenous communities in my riding and across the country? right hon. Chair, from the very beginning, we made funds available to Canadians right across the country, particularly people in indigenous remote or northern communities who we knew would be facing more difficult challenges because of the existing vulnerabilities in their health care system and socio-economic circumstances. We have made unprecedented investments and we will continue to make the necessary investments, because we need to make sure that indigenous Canadians, and indeed all Canadians, have the supports they need to make it through this crisis. luc berthold (mganticl'rable, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr.Chair. I am going to keep talking about the area of jurisdiction that the Prime Minister likes to talk about, except that I want to point out the incompetence of the Liberals in keeping their commitments on infrastructure projects. As the provinces gradually restart their economies, can the Prime Minister tell us how many projects that the provinces have submitted are waiting for approval from his government? mr. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, I hope that the length of the pause will not be taken out of my time. catherine mckenna (minister of infrastructure and communities): I'm sorry, Mr.Chair, I was on mute. It is very important to build projects that will create good jobs the chair: We are returning to Mr.Berthold. How many projects are currently awaiting government approval? I know that the minister has been meeting virtually with the provinces over the last few days. Rather than wait for the right political opportunity to approve these files, will the minister commit today to respecting the provinces and approving by next week all the projects that are sitting on her desk? hon. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, I'm pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories. We will announce the approval of projects because it's very important for our economy, our communities and creating good jobs. luc berthold: Does the minister understand that she hasn't told us how many projects are still pending? The construction season is very short. Approval of a project in July means that work can't begin until next year, which won't help revive our economy. catherine mckenna: I want to make it clear that we have approved hundreds of projects in the last few weeks. These projects are important for the economy and the environment, as well as for jobs the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, while the minister is calling for a green recovery of the country's economy, public transit is at risk. The Union des municipalits du Qubec estimates that the monthly losses are between $75million and $100million. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, we recognize the importance of public transit for our economy, since some essential workers use public transit. As the Prime Minister said, it's the provinces that must help because the money the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, once again, what we're hearing is that the government is passing the buck to the provinces. Unfortunately, the minister was unable to answer a single question about the number of infrastructure projects still on the federal government's desk, which is very important. In terms of the number of projects that we've approved, I would be happy to inform the hon. member of the exact number of all the approved projects that my department has been working very hard on over the past few months to approve projects to go forward. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, do I have any time left? the chair: No, your time is up. On March 28, the minister personally tweeted out a thank you to the People's Republic of China for donating PPE to Canada. More recently, Taiwan donated half a million surgical masks to Canada, yet here we are, two weeks later, and the minister has yet to personally thank Taiwan for its generosity. I can say, after my COVID foreign ministers call, that the world community has come together to make sure that supply chains will remain intact and that we will have transit hubs and air bridges. Chair, I didn't hear a thank you there, so I'm going to try again. On May 4, the Government of Taiwan delivered 25,000 surgical masks to the Government of British Columbia. Minister of Citizens' Services Anne Kang and Minister of State for Child Care Katrina Chen, who, as ministers, officially thanked the Government of Taiwan for its donation. Again, will the minister now do the right thing and, on behalf of Canadians, recognize the generosity of Taiwan and thank its government for that timely donation? hon. Chair, as I said to you before, Canada is grateful to all who have given supplies to Canada. As I said, when it comes to global health, when it comes to helping each other, I think it is a duty for all to come together. We are grateful and thankful for all those who have agreed to help Canada and Canadians from coast to coast to coast in times of need. I've repeated that and have said many times in many forums that we are grateful and thankful to all of those who are helping Canada. The Government of Taiwan has been the world leader in successfully fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, the People's Republic of China continues to oppose Taiwan's membership in the World Health Organization. Will the minister now do the right thing and assure Canadians that he will fully support efforts to grant Taiwan membership in the World Health Organization? hon. That said, we support Taiwan to continue meaningful participation in international multilateral forums, particularly when it comes to health. We also believe that Taiwan's role as an observer in the World Health Assembly meeting is of interest to the international health community and we have been supportive of that. Can he tell us exactly how many Canadians remain abroad who have expressed a desire to be repatriated? hon. As of today, we have repatriated more than 20,000 Canadians on 232 flights from 87 countries. As the Prime Minister and I have said from the beginning, we will make our best effort to repatriate everyone who wants to come back home during the crisis. My office has received correspondence from Canadians concerned that trial delays due to COVID-19 may result in criminals walking free. As this government has been working overtime to criminalize law-abiding citizens with new and useless gun laws, will the Minister of Justice ensure that real criminals will not walk free as a result of delays in the justice system? hon. We have been working with my provincial counterparts across Canada, as well as with the various federal courts and also, through my provincial counterparts, with the superior courts and courts of appeal across Canada. Each particular jurisdiction has taken measures to ensure that basic essential services within the court system are maintained, through a variety of means, and we believe that we will be able to solve these various challenges. Chair, the regional relief and recovery fund was announced weeks ago as a way to help small and medium-sized businesses in rural communities, like those in my riding. Can the minister clarify whether we are days away or weeks away from this support flowing to the businesses that need it so desperately? hon. Chair, I had the chance to talk with many of the chambers of commerce and business owners throughout Atlantic Canada, and we hear their anxiety. That's why ACOA's doing great work on the ground to make sure we can help them through this very difficult period. We have increased the budget of ACOAgood newsand I'll be coming up with the details very soon. It will be a pleasure to collaborate with him to make sure that we can help many businesses and business owners across the Atlantic region. In particular, they are unable to access the emergency business account, because they do not have a payroll. There are hundreds and thousands of small businesses in this very situation, vital small businesses in our communities, but they do not meet this requirement. What does the Minister of Finance have to say to these small businesses that are suffering right now? hon. I want all the businesses that he is talking about and all of them throughout the country to know that we continue to work very hard to make sure they're supported through this difficult period. We know that businesses are being supported through getting access to the wage subsidy to keep their employees together, and they're getting help, whether it's with rent or to defray costs by deferring GST and HST or customs duty payments. Some have a personal account that they've dealt with over the years rather than a business account, and that makes them ineligible. Chair, small businesses are concerned about their ability to survive, and no amount of deferrals, loans or subsidies can substitute for their need to be open and servicing their customers. Can the government confirm that a sectoral risk analysis has taken place to assist the provinces in reopening the economy? hon. Chair, I can assure the member that we've been very clear in terms of our strategy around reopening the economy. We need to make sure that we follow the advice of the experts and the health authorities to do so in a manner that does not compromise the health and well-being of Canadians. We of course will have a sectoral lens, and as you can see by some of the initiatives and the support packages we've put forward the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Can the government confirm that the programs currently in place will be expanded to these hard-working Canadians? hon. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we continue to work with all of our small businesses and I want to thank him for raising this very important issue. I want to assure our Canadian small businesses that we are going to continue to do this work to make sure they are supported. james cumming: Can the minister give me a date when she will be able to announce to these businesses that they will be eligible? hon. mary ng: I want to assure our Canadian small businesses of their importance and of the importance of their contributions to all of our communities. I want them to know that we continue to listen and that we will ensure that they are supported and continue to be supported during this difficult time. Can you give me a date when I can tell these thousands of businesses they will be supported if they pay dividends or if they use contractors within their businesses? hon. The landlord says that he doesn't have the 25% needed to be eligible for the program because he's already paying for common area costs and deferrals on utilities, which he will have to pay on his mortgage. Will the government reform the rent relief program to focus on tenants and not just the landlords? hon. Chair, I want to let the member know that we are working to make sure that the details of the emergency program for rent are out there so that both tenants and landlords can understand the situation. We're seeing a significant number of both landlords and tenants coming forward to register for this program, and we are convinced that it will be in the best interests of landlords to move forward and give tenants this relief. Chair, we've been hearing, however, from small business owners that their landlords don't find the government's rent relief program appealing enough. Can the government confirm, given the program's low eligibility rate, that the program will be expanded and be more efficient in helping tenants? hon. Chair, we recognize that it's critically important that all of the details of this program be out there for landlords and tenants to understand. This is a program that we've put out within the last week, and we are confident that it's in the best interests of tenants and landlords. One easy way to do that would be to expand the Canada summer jobs program to businesses with over 50 employees. Will the government consider doing so to allow students to gain that very valuable work experience over the coming months? hon. The second uptake provided employers across the country with the ability to add their needs for students to the mix. During this pandemic, the government has consistently called for a team Canada, non-partisan approach, and I was glad to hear that said a little earlier today. However, at the same time, the current government has used a parliamentary back door to launch a poorly thought out gun ban. We have a government that didn't win the popular vote, and I'm just wondering how I explain to my residents, because I'm getting so many calls, that this is not a bloated response because, quite frankly, it is. Chair, I think the honourable member can explain to his constituents that the forming of regulations through order in council is actually the process prescribed in law in Canada under section 117.15 of the Criminal Code. I would also invite the member to advise his constituents that way back in 1991, when there were some Conservatives who called themselves Progressive, the Mulroney government brought forward, in Bill C-17, the authority under that section for an order in council to prescribe specific makes, models and variants of military firearms as prohibited or restricted. terry dowdall: I'm not sure, but I'm hoping, that I'll get an honest answer on this question from the minister, who has everything from rocket launchers to basically toy guns on the ban list. When will we get the cost of this buyback program? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to please be careful in their language when they are referring to others. I won't comment on this one particularly, but I want all of you to be very, very careful when referring to other members. Chair, to respond to some of the obfuscations and deceptions that have been put out there. I think it's very clear, and I invite the member to look at the list of weapons that are the chair: We'll go back to Mr. bill blair: Actually, I'm very much looking forward to bringing forward legislation as soon as the House resumes. We will have a vigorous debate in Parliament about the form a buyback will take and we will bring forward a budget at that time. bill blair: If people are illegally in possession of the weapons and they're committing a crime, they will be dealt with for the crimes they commit. Canadians in my riding who suffer from cystic fibrosis are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. While these Canadians with existing lung conditions are incredibly worried about a virus that attacks the ability to breathe, the good news is that there are life-saving medicines for those with CF. I am wondering if and when the government will correct these guidelines and give access to life-saving medicines for our most vulnerable. Chair, as you know, the government has been very committed to improving access and affordability for prescription medications for all Canadians. The PMPRB regulatory amendments will help Canadians be able to afford their prescriptions, and Canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines. In fact, many countries with much lower medicine prices gained access to new medicines in the same time frame as Canada frame, or even faster, so we are excited to do this work. Chair, our seniors are being particularly hard hit right now during this pandemic, yet seniors have not been given any direct support. Funding to charities like the United Way is being labelled as support for seniors, but most won't see any of this support. Seniors in my riding have asked for an increase in their CPP and OAS, and to be able to make untaxed bulk withdrawals from their RRSPs while they still have some value. deb schulte (minister of seniors): I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. the chair: You might want to try your space bar and keep it down while you're speaking. I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. We've reduced the minimum RRIF withdrawal by 25%, and we've made the CERB available to working seniors who have lost their jobs due to the COVID pandemic. We know there's more work to do, and we'll have more to say in the future. the chair: I want to remind honourable members that if there are issues, we are taking note of them, and we'll hopefully resolve them by the next meeting. marie-hlne gaudreau (laurentideslabelle, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. In fact, we have been looking at a number of ways to support increased contact tracing across the country, including working with provinces and territories to boost their capacity through human resources and volunteer organizations. Anything we put forward as a digital tool to assist with contact tracing would be thoroughly considerate of Canadians' privacy rights. But you know as well as I do that the Privacy Commissioner has been calling us to task for a very long time now, because there is also a crisis of confidence. You know as well as I do that for 90%of Canadians, the misuse of their personal data is a cause for concern, whether it be for profiling or business development purposes. I'd like to know whether this commitment will be implemented quickly so that legislation can be passed on this issue, in this case the Privacy Act. We're talking about what is going on in Quebec, among other places, and I would like to make sure that the federal government commits to respecting the proposals regarding geolocation and contact tracing possibilities, with full respect for the right to privacy. We have worked very closely with provinces and territories for a long time before the outbreak, but certainly ever since the outbreak. We respect the rights of jurisdictional authorities to use tools that have been properly vetted through their own provincial and territorial legislation. marie-hlne gaudreau: Concerning privacy, there are 30million Quebeckers and Canadians who have had their personal data leaked. Why is it that our laws don't allow us to apply financial penalties so that we can then go further? The very basis is to be concerned about our fundamental rights. As the critic for access to information and privacy, I'd like a commitment that the federal government will deal not with what the provinces are doing, but with the Privacy Act. the chair: Your time is up, but I'll give the floor to the minister for 30seconds. Our government will ensure the privacy of Canadians is respected, support responsible innovation and take reasonable steps to strengthen enforcement powers. yvan baker (etobicoke centre, lib.): Thank you very much, Mr. Minister, in my riding of Etobicoke Centre, we are mourning the loss of 40 residents to COVID-19 at the Eatonville long-term care centre. Of all Canadians who have died from COVID-19, 79% were living in long-term care homes. I understand that long-term care homes fall within the jurisdiction of provincial governments in Canada, but this is a crisis. What is the federal government doing right now to help protect our seniors who are living in long-term care homes from COVID-19? What will we do to reform our long-term care homes in the future to ensure that our seniors in Etobicoke Centre and across Canada get the care they deserve? hon. We are deeply concerned by the outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities, and our thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one. As my colleague mentioned, while these facilities are regulated by provinces and territories, we have been focused on protecting the health and safety of long-term care residents and staff while working with our partners in a team Canada approach. We're working with the provinces and territories to cost-share a temporary salary top-up for long-term care workers. We are working through investing $2 billion to secure personal protective equipment for the health of workers, including those in the long-term care homes, and we've deployed the Canadian Armed Forces to assist 25 long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario. We all have a role to play to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect our seniors and caregivers. At the finance committee, we've heard a lot of concerns from all sectors of the economy as a result of COVID-19 and we've been presented with quite a number of possible solutions as well, several of which the government has acted upon. It is very welcome support, but I sincerely believe the farm sector will be taking the Prime Minister up on the suggestion that $250 million should be seen as an initial investment. However, as a result of reduced processor contracts for next year, plus cancelled seed contracts, millions of dollars of seed and process potatoes have no home. How does the minister see Tuesday's announcement addressing potato farmers' concerns? Second, in 2013, long-term financial safety nets were gutted by the Harper government. We know the importance of our potato farmers, and that's why we are launching a first-ever surplus food purchase program, a $50-million fund designed to help redistribute existing inventories, such as potatoes, to local food organizations. On the financial safety net that we have in place for our farmers, called the business risk management program, we announced up to $125 million in funding through AgriRecovery and made changes to AgriStability that will help producers quickly. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that BRM programs, including AgriInvest, are there to help farmers in difficult times. Robyn, who has owned Arbutus Health in Tofino for over 13 years, can't apply for the Canada emergency business account loan, simply because she doesn't have a payroll of over $20,000. With no business income and without emergency financing, it is virtually impossible for her to pay her bills or come up with the 25% needed for the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program. The government promised to be flexible and willing to adjust its COVID response rollout so that nobody falls through the cracks, but Robyn, like tens of thousands of proprietors who are the economic job creators of our communities, urgently needs the government's help now. Will the government amend its programs to help more business owners so that people like Robyn don't lose their businesses? hon. I know he and I have talked about this, and I appreciate the input and the feedback that he is providing from business directly. I want to assure Robyn and her businesses, and many businesses across the country, that we are absolutely listening, and we will continue to make sure we are supporting those businesses during this period. We also know that more has to be done, and we will continue to work with you and businesses across the country so that we can indeed give them that necessary support to weather this difficult period of COVID-19. I was talking to Heather last night, who also owns a business in Tofino, Basic Goodness Pizzeria, with her partner Marco. Like many proprietors of family businesses who aren't on payroll, they don't qualify for the business loans. Now with the new rollout of the rent support, they're not sure if their landlord is willing to play ball and even apply. Heather was in tears last night as she told me that they have done nothing wrong to deserve being excluded from these emergency programs. Will the government fix the rent support program so that tenants can apply, instead of leaving it up to landlords, and so businesses can get the help they desperately need? hon. We've been working on offering a response for small businesses and charities and non-profit organizations, and we are continuing to listen on the ground to how we can better assist the businesses that fall through the cracks. Chair, when the government rolled out its commercial rent support program, why didn't it negotiate an eviction moratorium with the provinces, as Australia and other countries did, to protect business owners? hon. We've recognized it and we've been working with the provinces and territories to implement the Canada emergency commercial rent the chair: We'll go back to Mr. gord johns: To qualify for the Canada emergency wage subsidy, a 30% drop in revenue has to be shown. Anyone who's owned a business knows that even with this program, it's going to be hard to survive. Why is the government using a 70% measurement drop to qualify for the rent support program, but a 30% drop for the wage subsidy? hon. We've been working with provinces and territories to provide forgivable loans to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rents for their tenants by 75%. We're hoping that tenants and landlords will be working together so we can support businesses during this very difficult crisis. the chair: Before we move on to the next question, Mr.Berthold, did you have a question or a point of order? mr. I checked the clock from the first round of five minutes, and as you may recall, it took a very long time for me to get an answer from the government. During my first turn, it took 50seconds before a government minister deigned to answer my questions. After checking my time, I realized that the discussion between Ms.McKenna and I went on for four minutes and 14seconds, so I wasn't able to ask the minister one final question, a very important one. I would ask you to take that into account and allow me to ask MinisterMcKenna one last question, please. the chair: The person chairing the meeting uses their judgment and does their best to keep an eye on what's going on. I think it's more or less equal for all the members, but I apologize if the honourable member feels that he was denied a few seconds. bill blair: The decision to close the border was made in Canada by Canadians in the best interest of Canadians. todd doherty: When will the government be in a position to inform Canadians of any changes to the agreement? hon. bill blair: I'm pleased to advise the member that we're continuing to monitor the situation, but I'm strongly of the opinion that the circumstances on both sides of our border do not indicate that this is the right time to make a change in the restrictions. todd doherty: Can the government confirm whether there are any discussions about reopening the border to certain modes of transportation and restricting others? the chair: Before I go to the minister, I want to remind the honourable members that we do have translators, and they are trying to translate. With respect to them, I know we're trying to get as many questions in as possible, but they do have to translate them, so please be considerate of our interpreters. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Let me please inform the honourable member that we are, of course, aware that the current agreement expires. navdeep bains: We are engaged with the industry, and we are working with them on a solution, Mr. Chair, will this relief package include funding for airline ticket refunds similar to what other countries around the world have done? Yes or no? hon. Chair, I can confirm that Air Canada has now adopted a policy of checking temperatures for passengers boarding Air Canada flights. Last week I asked the Minister of Labour if they were aware of a letter written on April 6 by CUPE to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Minister, were you aware of that letter? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly. todd doherty: On April 6, CUPE wrote a letter to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Before that I had conversations with CUPE with respect to flight attendants and the use of personal protective equipment. todd doherty: Can the minister confirm whether or not they have provided PPE to the flight attendants and/or training for front-line staff for airlines and airports? hon. This has become a policy to ensure the safety not only of passengers on board but also of the flight attendants and flight crew. He stated that he couldn't give his small business tenants a break on rent because the government is penalizing him for paying off his mortgage. Chair, as you know, we laid out the CECRA program just last week, and we are encouraging landlords to take that opportunity to support the renters. Is the minister aware of this, and are they trying to revise the CECRA program? hon. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with provinces and territories to present that program. We are asking, actually encouraging, landlords to do their part and help tenants, like the one you mentioned, go through this. It's been heartbreaking, frankly, to hear that everything they've built and sacrificed for is in serious jeopardy, and through no fault of their own. Your government has created programs that are supposed to help them, but many legitimate businesses aren't able to apply. I'm hoping to hear specifics, not just nice words, on what you're going to do to help them. First, businesses that recently incorporatedfor example, in late 2019are unable to apply their entire 2019 payroll. As a result, many are falling short of the $20,000 payroll threshold required to qualify for this loan. What is your government going to do about these three scenarios? the chair: I just want to remind honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly to the minister. As well, please take into consideration the interpreters, who have to listen and translate, so that we can have this conversation. Right from the very beginning, we've always said that we will listen and that we will work to make sure that measures go out to help our Canadian small businesses. She's absolutely right: 98% of all our businesses in this country are small businesses, so they absolutely contribute enormously to our communities and are job creators. For the Canada emergency business account, over 550,000 small businesses have been approved and are getting that support. I can assure the honourable member that we will continue to do this work so that businesses, all businesses, are supported, whether it is helping keep your employees together, helping with rent support, helping to keep your business's expenses low, or of course helping with the capital that is needed so that you can pay your operating expenses and your bills through this difficult time. Moving on, there are two issues regarding the 50% commercial rent assistance subsidy, where landlords pay 25%, the government pays 50%, and the tenant is responsible for 25%. First, many of the small landlords aren't able to take a 25% hit to their income, and are unable to provide the subsidy to their tenants. Second, with the 70% decline in revenue threshold for small businesses to even be eligible for the rent assist, many restaurants are at 65% or 67% decline. What is the government planning to do to streamline this program for small businesses that can't access but desperately need the rent subsidy? hon. Chair, as the Minister of Official Languages, I just want to raise the fact that interpretation is very complicated right now. In order to make sure that we can continue to uphold bilingualism within the House, I would love it if my colleagues could take down the pace a bit. I just want to remind everyone again that when you're asking a question, make sure you are doing it at a pace at which you're considering the people who are interpreting ms. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with the provinces and territories to provide this forgivable loan to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rent of their tenants by 75%. It will be very important that we understand what happens across the country, and we will monitor and adapt the program as we ms. Chair, it has been in the media quite a bit that this rent subsidy is not helping many, many, many small business owners. It's falling short of everything that was announced, so I think it needs to be taken a bit more seriously than that. We know that some still fall through the cracks and we will look at how we can continue to support businesses across the country. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We are now going to Mr. Three weeks ago, on April 17, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced funding of $500 million to assist Canada's arts, sports and cultural sectors. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Madam Chair, we will be releasing the details of that announcement, and how the money is going to be spent, in the coming days. kevin waugh: We all know that many media organizations, large and small, in Canada are struggling right now. Allegations have arisen that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, is currently engaging in predatory behaviour and taking advantage of the current situation to harm its competitors using rate cuts. kevin waugh: Local community and ethnic media outlets and papers have strong ties to their communities that often go much deeper than the major media outlets. Is the government currently using any local or ethnic media outlets to provide crucial coronavirus information through advertising? hon. We need to get the information to Canadians on COVID-19, which is why we have started an ad-buy campaign of $30 million, which is being distributed in more than 900 local, regional and national newspapers across the country and 500 radio and TV stations in 12 different languages, including Farsi, Mandarin, Spanish, Italian and many more. It has received two ads from an ad agency in connection with the $30 million the government is doling out to help media outlets. Is this the kind of money you're attempting to dole out to help media: two ads in eight weeks? hon. steven guilbeault: Madam Chair, we have been doing a number of things for our media in Canada over the last few months and will continue to do so. On top of that $30 million ad-buy campaign, we have been investing $50 million in local journalism. Just this year, it means that 200 journalists will be hired in areas across the country where journalism is more poorly defined. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, last week, as the minister would know, 15 community newspapers, including eight in Manitoba and seven in the province of Ontario, closed their doors for good. Is the government currently planning any further measures aimed at assisting community or ethnic media organizations? We understand that many more will close their doors within the next 30 to 60 days. steven guilbeault: We are planning a number of other measures, some of which will be included in the $500 million. Of the $595 million that the media will receive, we have a tax credit that has now entered into force, and the cheques should be in the mail by the end of the summer. So there are a number of things we've done and a number of things we will be doing in the coming months as well. kevin waugh: Well, finally, you have the five members associated with that committee to dole out the $595 million. colleague that in order for us to provide tax breaks for the 2019 period, media outlets had to file their tax returns so we could go ahead. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. This being the first time I've had the floor during a virtual sitting of Parliament, I'd like to take this opportunity to greet my fellow members, all 259participants. I'd like to talk about the Prime Minister's appearance on the show Tout le monde en parle. This is what he had to say about his economic recovery plan:     We are going to remain focused on the economy as a wholeinnovationresearch and science, the green economy and a fairer economyThere are things we are all reflecting on right now that reflection is going to continue. Can the government assure Canadians that it is being proactive and working on a plan to get the economy moving again? It must act now. Our government is wholly committed to restarting the economy, and we are working closely with the provinces to do just that. Last week, our government, together with the provincial and territorial premiers, released the principles that will guide efforts to restore economic activity across the country. jol godin: MadamChair, before we go any further, since it took a while for the minister, or the government, to answer the question, can I have that time back to ask questions? the acting chair (mrs. The Prime Minister's answer during his appearance on Tout le monde en parle didn't inspire much confidence and doesn't line up with the Deputy Prime Minister's comments. How can the government be proud of announcing $252million in assistance for the agri-food sector, when that is less than 1% of all the program funding the government has committed to help Canadians get through the COVID-19 crisis? Clearly, the government doesn't see the food supply chain as a priority and has no regard for farmers and pork and beef producers. Does the government realize that eating is vital to Canadians? When is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food going to adjust the program and show respect for Canadian farmers? hon. This week, we focused on beef and pork producers and processors, as well as sectors with product surpluses that can be redirected to food banks. I can assure my fellow member that this is an additional step and that more supports are on the way in the weeks ahead. PortneufJacques-Cartier is home to a company that is already licensed by Health Canada and that, for 20years, has been manufacturing medical equipment including masks, face shields and thermometers. In mid-March, Health Canada reached out to the company to find out how much equipment it could manufacture to help fight COVID-19. The company confirmed that it could immediately start producing 200,000masks a week, ramping up to a million masks over the next few weeks. Can the health minister tell us why, 45days later, this company licensed by Health Canada hasn't received an order? hon. Industry and suppliers have enthusiastically answered our call to equip Canada with products and goods during the crisis. Seniors living alone are most at risk of economic insecurity, particularly single senior women, as gender inequality in the job market has translated all too often into inadequate retirement income. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a poverty reduction plan that addresses the unique challenges faced by older women? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to assure the member that we are quite aware that this pandemic has typically affected single seniors, and many of those, given that they live longer, are single senior women. I want to assure her that we are working on this issue, and we have provided some supports already through measures such as the GST supplementary payment. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, older women represent a high proportion of residents in long-term care facilities. Having spent their lives caring for parents, children and often their partners, they find themselves needing care in nursing homes. Multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Canada have highlighted systemic gaps that senior and elderly women may face in such facilities, as well as the working conditions of the female-dominated ranks of nurses and personal support workers. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a federal strategy for long-term care homes that recognizes quality of life for residents and working conditions for the employees, ideally one that goes hand in hand with a poverty reduction plan and enhanced home and community care investments across the country? hon. We are obviously deeply saddened by the outbreaks that have been going on in long-term care facilities and those who have lost their lives. We do recognize that the administration of long-term care and palliative care is the responsibility of provinces and territories; however, we have been taking a team Canada approach, and as you already know, we've been doing tremendous work with them to try to ensure that those who live in those facilities can be well cared for and safe. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, from May 4 to May 10, we are observing Mental Health Week. We know that our essential workers right now are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety, on top of putting their own physical safety and health on the line. Most of these workers work in precarious jobs with no access to paid sick leave or vacation, and without any benefits to access mental health services. Apart from the very welcome investments in online resources, can the minister explain how the government will support these workers now and once the crisis is behind us? hon. I'm so glad that she's raising the issue of mental health and in particular how poor mental health is oftentimes connected to our socio-economic status. We do have new resources that are available to all Canadians free of charge through the Wellness Together portal, but there is more to do. I think the announcement of top-up wages, for example, which the Prime Minister spoke about today, is another example of how we're taking the health and wellness of all low-income Canadians very seriously. We know that mental health is not divorced from socio-economic status, and I look forward to working with her more on other measures that we can take together. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, we're all very aware of the importance of temporary foreign workers and their role in ensuring our food sovereignty across this country. How are we protecting them? Madam Chair, will the government take action to strengthen legislation and ensure Canadians have access to the food they need while the workers who help bring it to our tables have safe working conditions, regardless of where they are working in this country? hon. We are very concerned, as are countries around the world, that we support and create the environment for the health and safety of our temporary foreign workers and we value their contribution to our food supply chain here in Canada. We have issued guidelines to employers and are working very closely with local public health authorities in the provinces and territories to make sure workers are protected, that physical distancing and other recommendations are adhered to and that there are severe consequences if employers don't take care of their workers. alistair macgregor (cowichanmalahatlangford, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. My first question is this: Will the Liberal government prevent federal bailout funds from going to companies that use tax havens and avoid paying their fair share here in Canada, yes or no? hon. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): We are working to make sure that anyone who tries to circumvent the rules faces serious consequences. Anyone who abuses the program could face fines of up to 225% of the subsidy amount as well as five years in prison. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, I didn't really hear a yes to that question, so I'll repeat it. Does the government really think it's appropriate for tax-avoiding corporations to receive funding provided for by taxpayers? hon. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, the agriculture funding announced by the government earlier this week amounts to less than 10% of what the Canadian Federation of Agriculture estimates will be required to help farmers weather this crisis. I have to remind my colleague that we have put in $5 billion through FCC, $50 million for the temporary foreign workers, two times $50 million for pork and beef producers this week, and $77 million for food processing. This is only the beginning, and we should not forget that the business risk management programs are still there to offer support. alistair macgregor: Yes, Madam Chair, but we're nearly two months into this pandemic and this announcement only came this week. marie-claude bibeau: Madam Chair, we are working closely with the farmers and their representatives to identify where the gaps are, but once again, we have made improvements to the AgriStability program. They can get, depending on the province, either 50% or 75% in advance payments, and they can also, right now, access their AgriInvest program. There is more than $2 billion ready to access today, if they have the acting chair (mrs. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, federal disability recipients and seniors on fixed incomes have been hardest hit by cost of living increases from COVID-19. If we acknowledge that $2,000 per month is the minimum needed to get through this time, why are they being asked to survive on far less? When can they expect assistance, and how much will they receive? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to make sure people realize that we have provided some assistance through the GST supplementary benefit. We are also providing support to those who are still working, and we have done that by allowing them to access the CERB. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, as I think we've heard through today's question period, there are countless example of this government designing programs to exclude many small businesses that desperately need help. Whether it's the payroll requirements or other eligibility, we still, to this day, almost two months into the pandemic, have too many small businesses falling through the cracks. Madam Chair, why has the government taken this approach and when can we finally expect fixes to the whole system? hon. mary ng: Madam Chair, right from the get-go, we have been committed to making sure that Canadians are helped through this crisis, and that small businesses get the support that they need, so that we are saving businesses and jobs in this country. yves perron (berthiermaskinong, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I hear the questions my fellow members are asking, and to be frank, I don't find the answers satisfactory. It is well and good to talk about existing programs, but they aren't working, so enough with that refrain. This morning, both farmers and processors came together for a press conference at the Union des producteurs agricoles's head office in Longueuil. Can the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food therefore tell us when she will announce significant supports for the industry? hon. marie-claude bibeau: We have already announced significant amounts of support, and more is on the way. It's not that the programs aren't working; it's that they aren't generous enough in farmers' eyes. That's why I'm working with my provincial counterparts to make improvements to programming, including AgriStability. After using the online AgriStability benefit estimator, a pork producer found out that he would get $11 per head, as they say in the industry. Pork producers are calling for $20 per head, so it's a good start, even though it's not enough and it isn't what they are asking for. We want to keep working together, but farmers have to access the money available to them through AgriStability. Even before the crisis, we were hearing from people in the industry that the programs were neither suitable nor sufficient. A few days ago, the government announced $50million in funding for pork producers, even though they are asking for $20per hog for 27million hogs. When is the government going to announce a whole lot more in funding support? What's been announced so far is only 10% of what farmers are asking for. However, I would point out to the member that, when it comes to AgriRecovery, we made an exception to the rule. That's two funding envelopes of $50million each to help cover the additional costs from the decrease in plant processing capacity. As the Prime Minister said, we are going to do more, and we are moving forward step by step. yves perron: What we concluded in committee this week is that the $125million is not new money. The government can't say that programs already exist and, at the same time, claim that they are new programs. Everyone knows that the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement came into force a month earlier than planned, despite the promises that had been made. An easy way to make money available without committing new spending is to provide compensation and announce programs for supply-managed sectors that got nothing. It seems to me that a time of crisis is a time for the government to practise some judo and announce measures. I am reaching out to the government, as I always do, but it has to come forward with announcements. marie-claude bibeau: Our commitment to farmers in supply-managed sectorsmeaning, egg, poultry and dairy farmersis as strong as it always was. Support for poultry and egg farmers is in the form of investment programs, which aligns well with the recovery. At this time, we are focusing on emergency programs to help farmers hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. As you know, legislative changes are needed to grant the Canadian Dairy Commission's request and increase its borrowing limit by $200million so it can buy more butter and cheese. Chair, we're all inundated, as we've heard during this entire question period, with Canadians' concerns about the economic restrictions and the social restrictions that they're under. Over the last couple of months, the WHO has given one very consistent message in terms of coming out of those economic and social restrictions. Tedros said in his briefing, We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. On March 25, 44 days ago, he said, Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictionstheyre also the best way to prevent them. Does the minister agree with the WHO that relentless testing and tracing are critical to a successful economic and social relaunch strategy in Canada? hon. Absolutely, we agree that testing and contact tracing will form an important part of our response to living with COVID. We've been investing heavily in ensuring that we have the lab capacity, the collaboration across provinces and territories, and the variety of testing options to help us increase our capacity to test. We are aiming right now for a high volume of tests, but I will also say that in Canada we have one of the highest testing rates in the world. Although we're doing well, I can assure him that I am with him and I believe we need to do more. Chair, as I mentioned to his colleagues yesterday, we have currently the capacity to do approximately 60,000 tests per day across the country. Chair, it's hard for me to get that exact number, but I will get back to him with the exact number. She said, As a first tranche, roughly close to 60,000 is where the provinces can potentially expand to as a target already. Does the minister happen to know, ballpark, what the average number of daily tests in Canada has been since that statement? hon. patty hajdu: Your estimate was slightly higher than what my estimate was going to be, so that's a great piece of news. Listen, I will just say that I think if the premise here is that we could be doing more testing. I would agree, but I will also say that the provinces and territories are working incredibly hard on testing strategies that meet their own specific needs. Tam works with all the chief public health officers across the country to ensure that their testing strategy is going to be applicable and appropriate for their particular jurisdictions. mike lake: Following up on that, is there a jurisdiction in Canada where relentless testing is not the appropriate strategy as provinces consider relaunching? hon. For example, in British Columbia, where there are relatively fewer cases in general and less disease activity, they may have a different testing strategy than a province like Ontario, which is currently struggling with more outbreaks. mike lake: Given your comment that our current testing capability is 60,000, and acknowledging that only at one point in the entire history of our COVID response, over several months, has our weekly average been over 30,000it was about 31,000 for one day on a rolling basisMinister, are you satisfied with our current testing amounts right now, given that we're testing 50% of what the public health officer advises would be best? hon. patty hajdu: I'm so amazed by the work the provinces and territories have done in a very short time to increase their capacity. We are supporting them with the tools that they need to get more testing done, but also to have other components in place that will allow them to do the rapid tracing of positive cases. I think it's very important to remember that testing strategies will be different across the provinces, based on the outbreak disease epidemiology. Having said that, I know that we can all do better, and I'm certain that my counterparts feel the same"

        "Query": "Summarize the difficulties faced by secondary schools in carrying out curriculum reform, the opinions on support or changes of circumstances, the stress faced by the oil and gas industry, and the discussion about restoring Canadian businesses during the pandemic. Additionally, provide insights on the perspectives of Heather McPherson and Chrystia Freeland on restoring Canadian businesses during the pandemic.",
        "Summary": "Despite some primary schools having surplus funds, many secondary schools are facing deficits and a lack of funds. Additionally, there is a shortage of teachers with appropriate training. Concerns arise regarding the ability of lower-tier schools to adapt to the new curriculum and improve teaching quality. The approach to students has not changed, but individual circumstances may require adjustments from the Student Loans Company. Challenges in service delivery may arise due to staff shortages caused by illness, self-isolation, or adherence to social-distancing measures. Early monitoring was implemented due to the presence of campuses and activities in China and Southeast Asia. The oil and gas industry has been heavily impacted by anti-oil and gas lobby groups, resulting in the introduction of bills that restrict major projects and oil shipping. These actions have caused a significant decline in investment and a recession in the Alberta economy. Members express concerns about the government's handling of pandemic-related restrictions, particularly in relation to reopening businesses and providing effective stimulus. They emphasize the need to reopen fishing, restore agricultural supply chains, and support farmers. Questions are raised about the government's response to outbreaks in meat-packing plants and the provision of financial support to workers in unsafe conditions. The government is also questioned about providing pandemic relief funds to businesses utilizing tax havens. Hon. Chrystia Freeland acknowledges the hard work of farmers and emphasizes the importance of a safe working environment, trusting the Food Inspection Agency to regulate conditions.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order.  Welcome to the 23rd meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  A reminder to all members that in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not also be connected to the video conference. For those of you who are joining via video conference, I will remind you that when speaking you should be on the same channel as the language you are speaking, and please use your headsets. I remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of this special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, I ask that they please come and drop their signed certificates off at the table once the petition is presented. I would ask members to be very brief and concise, and to summarize the exact content of the petition. The residents of SaanichGulf Islands are calling on the government to simplify the process for protection of marine protected areas. The marine protected area first proposed in the 1970s for the southern Strait of Georgia, now called the Salish Sea, has been awaiting designation for so long that it was originally endorsed by Jacques Cousteau. The second petition is from petitioners who are very concerned about our obligations under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and our commitments under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action. They specifically reference the RCMP violation of UNDRIP in its actions on Wet'suwet'en territory and ask the government to commit to actually living the principles embodied in UNDRIP. I am presenting a petition on behalf of the one in a million Canadians who suffer severe and adverse effects from vaccinations. GuillainBarre syndrome is very debilitating, and this petition seeks the setting up of a no-fault accident or compensation system to help offset the loss of work, the loss of wages and the loss of quality of life that many of these people suffer. denis trudel (longueuilsaint-hubert, bq): Mr.Chair, culture is the soul of a people. Over the past 20years or so, culture, especially music, has never been as accessible as it is now. The advent of digital technology has completely overturned the system for distributing the wealth generated by creators for the benefit of various Web stakeholders, many of whom are billionaires. The third is for Internet and cell phone providers who sell their services as direct access to culture to share their profits with artists. Six thousand people have already signed the first version of this petition, launched last month by musician JordanOfficer and supported by singer BarbaraSecours. As an artist, I am proud to present this petition today because the issues it raises are fundamental to the survival of Quebec culture. garnett genuis (sherwood parkfort saskatchewan, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr. I will be as brief as you suggested, although I will observe that if some members are going on longer during petitions than they normally do, it might be because the government has taken away so many of the tools that opposition members normally have for raising important issues in the House. The petitioners are concerned that instead of focusing on improving medically assisted life, something that we know is a major issue in light of recent revelations, the government has put so much time and legislative energy into efforts to continually further expand euthanasia in Canada and remove vital safeguards. The reality of the way that bill applies is that people from certain backgrounds who wish to practise their faith are not able to fully participate in Canadian society if they are employed in the public service. This petition asks the government to provide a response on that issue, something it hasn't done in response to past petitions on this. The petitioners want to see the government take a strong response in dealing with illegal guns and gun smuggling. At the same time, the petitioners are concerned that the government has the wrong focusthat is, harassing law-abiding firearms ownerswithout putting in place substantial measures to deal with illegal guns. The petitioners want to see the reversal of the order in council from May 1 and strong measures to deal with illegal firearms. The fourth and final petition deals with Bill S-204, a bill that would make it a criminal offence for a Canadian to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who has not consented to giving that organ. It would also create a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. The petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204 and of similar bills in previous parliaments and would like to see us pass that bill as soon as possible. These residents have signed a petition asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to put a high priority on assisting our poorest seniors. The increases to the GIS by $200, and $300 to the OAS, have been well received. They just want to highlight how important it is to support our seniors, in particular the poorest of our seniors. the chair: For members present in the Chamber, a reminder that they are asked to bring their petitions to the table. June 21 is National Indigenous Peoples Day, a day of acknowledgement and a day of celebration of the beautiful diversity of indigenous peoples across Turtle Island. I wish to recognize the leadership of Chief Shelley Sabattis of the Welamukotuk First Nation in Oromocto, New Brunswick. Each year she and her council, volunteers and staff go above and beyond to show appreciation for their members and to demonstrate pride and culture while promoting well-being. We gather in an event where all are welcome to take part, from traditional hand drum-making with elders to moose meat and tacos. This year we will celebrate a bit differently, but we will still stay connected, virtually and in spirit, to the vast network of indigenous peoples and allies. Chair, COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge for all communities across Canada, but as we do our part to flatten the curve, I often think about those who suit up every morning to serve on the front lines of our health care system. Even before the crisis, they would often share the hardships they faced on a day-to-day basis. Share this message and say thanks to our front-line workers, participate in the 7 p.m. doug shipley (barriespringwateroro-medonte, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Slowly, we are getting back to some resemblance of normalcy, although unfortunately not soon enough for some of our great summer festivals. It will not be normal in BarrieSpringwaterOro-Medonte this summer without the iconic Boots and Hearts weekend music festival, Kempenfest, Oro World's Fair, the Elmvale Fall Fair, or the Midhurst Autumnfest. Because of the lack of Canada Day celebrations, I've created Happy Canada Day lawn signs that are available through my constituency office, free to all residents of BarrieSpringwaterOro-Medonte. I'm also hosting a drive-through party on Canada Day at the Royal Canadian Legion on St. Among the countless ordinary Canadians who have stepped up to do extraordinary work during COVID-19, I wish to draw attention to our teachers. My father was a teacher, and my daughter-in-law, Kelly Webb, is one now. I'm certain that my colleagues can all easily remember a teacher in their past who played an important role in helping them achieve their potential. This is not the school year anyone imagined, and what the next one will look like is unclear, but our teachers in London West and across Canada have shown that no matter what, they will be there to help our next generation shine. the chair: Before proceeding to the next presenter, I just want to remind the honourable members in the chamber that I realize that the six-foot limit makes it harder to whisper to each other, but we're hearing a bit of rumble, so I just want you to try to whisper at your best. stphane bergeron (montarville, bq): Mr.Chair, on July1st, we will be celebrating one of the most important events for the riding of Montarville: the 175thanniversary of the city of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville. The theme Proud of our traditions will be the focus of this celebration for the people of Montarville. This is a good illustration of the rich history of this municipality nestled in the western foothills of Mont-Saint-Bruno. The seigneury of Montarville was granted in1710 to the illustrious former governor of Trois-Rivires, PierreBoucher. The parish of Saint-Bruno, which took root there and in which a village grew, became a municipal corporation in1845. To this day, it is one of the most prosperous localities, with a strong sense of belonging, a very dynamic community life and jealously preserved natural environments. A whole program had been drawn up for the celebration, but the current health crisis has taken over some of the planned activities, which has in no way diminished the pride and festive spirit of the people of Montarville. Chair, thank you for allowing me to take a moment to highlight an initiative that I started early on during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Heroes of EtobicokeLakeshore is an opportunity for citizens in my riding to recognize the contributions of those in their community who make life a bit easier. I'm pleased with the number of nominations I received that honour everyone from front-line workers to businesses that are innovating in these difficult times to volunteers who are finding new ways to reach out. I think of Daniel Lauzon who set up Food for Now, a mobile service that helps take care of the homeless. I think of Toni Varone, who helped his business clients by forgiving their rents, or young Lucas, who wanted to thank his teachers. I've been moved and inspired by the countless stories of generosity, strength, resiliency, kindness, incredible character and creativity. Chair, it gives me great pleasure to thank a local Richmond-based charity, the Social Diversity for Children Foundation, SDC, for its hard work both in raising funds for the purchase of personal protective equipment and in distributing this PPE to long-term care facilities and individual seniors' homes in the lower mainland of B.C. The COVID-19 relief fund is supported by a dozen other non-profits, businesses and community groups. It is amazing to have witnessed how the younger generation have gotten involved in caring for the elderly at this very challenging time. Chair, June is ALS Awareness Month, and 79 years after Lou Gehrig died from ALS little has changed. On June 21, Canadians will gather virtually to raise funds for ALS Canada in the Walk to End ALS. In Halton, normally we meet each year at Bronte Creek Provincial Park on the May long weekend to raise funds for ALS Canada. This year I will virtually join Tim's Titans, a team formed to honour Tim Robertson, my friend who died in 2016 after living with ALS for 13 years. I have a T-shirt, with a picture of Lou Gehrig, that says, Great Player...Lousy Disease and Tim's Titans...Great Team! ALS...Still a Lousy Disease. Join me on June 21 for the virtual Walk to End ALS to raise funds to support patients and their families and for ALS research. The peaceful protests that we're seeing across the country and around the world were not triggered by an isolated incident. They are fuelled by decades of ineffective action against something that is so insidious and deeply entrenched in our history, systems and institutions. It exists when a shocking report exposes the Peel District School Board's failure to work fairly with the black community. It exists when D'Andre Campbell, who was fighting mental illness, loses his life at the hands of the police. We need to dismantle the systems that allow this privilege and oppression to take form, and address the unconscious bias plaguing our institutions. Chair, a few months ago I rose in the House on the eve of our closure due to COVID-19. I told Canadians we must not give in to fear, that we would carry on and get through this crisis stronger than ever. Businesses are reopening, jobs are returning and our lives are starting to feel a bit normal again. Canadians pulled together, and because of that we did not see the devastating death toll that many had predicted. Life may be returning to normal, but unfortunately, here in this chamber of democracy, the people's voices continue to be shut down. In the words of my grandfather, it's time for the Liberals to get with the program and bring back the House. Chair, from in-person learning to virtual classrooms, COVID-19 has drastically changed the lives of students across the country, especially those in post-secondary education who are worried about covering costs like tuition or rent this coming fall. Our government recognized that students should not have to worry or put their futures on pause during this difficult time. If you're a high school student headed to a post-secondary school, or a current post-secondary student or a recent graduate, you can receive the Canada emergency student benefit every four weeks and have the financial support that you need to save for school. We also doubled Canada student grants and loans, enhanced the student loan program, increased supports for indigenous post-secondary education and introduced the Canada student service grant for those who wish to pursue it. I wish them all the very best, and I wish all of you, my colleagues and those across Canada, a very happy National Indigenous Peoples Day, which is coming up on June 21. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to keep to their 60 seconds so that we don't go over the time. Chair, I rise today to once again implore the government to do something about the horrible lack of access to and crazy cost of rural Internet service. Right now, too many areas of my riding have no access to rural Internet service at all, and those who can get service are paying through the nose. I've even heard constituents say that during this pandemic, they are having to choose between feeding their kids and educating them. Is that too much to ask of the government? the chair: We'll now go to Mr. Chair, these last few months have been incredibly challenging for the residents of CowichanMalahatLangford, who have been forced to deal with the economic and social consequences of COVID-19. The pandemic has laid bare the inadequacies of our social safety net, the weakness in our supply chains and the dependence of our society on essential workers, who often work long hours for low wages, putting themselves and their families at risk. We've also been forced to confront the systemic inequality, poverty and racism that continue to hold so many people back from achieving their full potential. I will not dishonour the sacrifice that so many have made during this time by allowing us to go back to the status quo that got us here in the first place. I will not apologize for demanding that the most vulnerable in our society get the supports and opportunities they need to live with dignity, and I will not relent from pushing my political colleagues to summon the courage necessary to implement policies that lead to environmental, economic and social justice. steven blaney (bellechasseles etcheminslvis, cpc): Mr.Chair, here is a beautiful story, the story of a woman from Bellechasse, a courageous young mother from Saint-Malachie, Marie-ChristineGoupil. With three children, including the eldest daughter with a disability, and realizing that her daughter with a disability had special clothing needs, she decided to go into business to meet the needs of other parents who, like her, were facing their child's clothing challenges. Marie-ChristineGoupil has discovered a passion for entrepreneurship and has moved and inspired many people with her passionate and courageous attitude. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I lend my voice to the Chief of the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec-Labrador, GhislainPicard, whose message is as follows:     There have been no fewer than 14reports and conclusions of commissions of inquiry since1967 highlighting major problems in relations between law enforcement agencies and indigenous people. Are you going to respond, as you too often do, by moving on to the next one, or are you going to do what we expect you to do, which is to recognize that the justice system discriminates against indigenous people and that we have no less right to security than the rest of the population? In three months, police interventions have claimed more victims among our members than the pandemic. rachael harder (lethbridge, cpc): Over the last few months, Canada's democracy has been disregarded and an autocracy has been resurrected in its place. In 2014, he professed that Canadians want their Members of Parliament to be effective voices for their communities in Ottawa, and not merely mouthpieces for an all-too-powerful Prime Minister. A government that does not allow for effective opposition is not functioning in the best interest of Canadians; it is operating in the best interest of itself and, even more so, the interest of the Prime Minister. Canadians deserve to flourish in a democracy, not merely survive under the autocracy that this Prime Minister has created. Chair, I would like to recognize the work of Agincourt Community Services Association and its tireless executive director, Lee Soda, who have been serving our community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under more pressure than ever, their staff and volunteers continue to serve a community whose need was great even before the crisis. They have opened outdoor washrooms and hand-washing stations for vulnerable communities and are delivering groceries and other essentials to vulnerable seniors. ACSA is a bridge between those who can help and those who need help, and they are just one example of how our community has come together to meet this challenge. There are restaurants and businesses donating meals to front-line workers, residents answering the call to stock the food bank shelves and neighbours looking in on the vulnerable and isolated. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice in order to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Chair, for months Conservatives have been pointing out flaws in Liberal government programs that are preventing Canadians from getting the help they need. The Prime Minister has refused to make these very technical changes to get more help to Canadians who need it. For example, on the wage subsidy, more than two-thirds of the money allocated for that program has lapsed because businesses don't qualify. Will the Prime Minister change the program to allow companies who have made acquisitions to access the wage subsidy to keep more people working? right hon. Chair, from the very beginning we knew that as we rolled out measures, we would need to improve them and tweak them, and that's exactly what we've been doing over the past three months. But we continued to improve them, to make additions and amendments so that more people could get the help they needed, including with the proposed legislation last week that expanded the reach of the wage subsidy to more businesses. Chair, it was the Liberals who said no to the motion to allow this Parliament to sit to debate that motion, and even in that legislation they refused to allow businesses who have made acquisitions to access the program. Now, when we look at the rent relief program, it is so difficult to apply for it that many landlords are refusing to bother, leaving even more small businesses to fall through the cracks. In fact, of the $3 billion allocated to the rent relief program, only $39 million has been paid out. It's now June and he has refused to fix these programs and has successfully talked out the calendar on the days that the House of Commons could meet to discuss these programs. We recognize, in conversations with the premiers, how important it is to make sure that we're working together, the provinces and the federal government, on issues like rent subsidies where commercial rent is indeed a provincial jurisdiction. Many provinces have moved forward with the eviction bans that are necessary to go along with this, and we'll continue to work with provinces to make sure that we're getting Canadians the help they need. He has run down the clock on parliamentary sittings and he still refuses to make these changes to get more help to Canadians. Some of these sites are very near sensitive government institutions, like government departments, the National Research Council, RCMP headquarters and the Bank of Canada. How long has the Prime Minister known that Huawei technology has been installed in the Ottawa area? right hon. Chair, first off, on the issue of Parliament, it has been meeting four times a week over the past many weeks, and members of the opposition have been able to continue to ask questions on COVID-19 and a broad range of subjects. Moreover, every two weeks the finance department puts forward at the finance committee the full transparent measures that we've taken, so that parliamentarians can study them. justin trudeau: in regard to Huawei technology there are strict rules for companies to follow and we assume they will all follow those. I want to remind the honourable members who are joining us virtually that heckling really does disrupt the whole session. Your face does come up and we do see who it is, so I just want to make sure that you're aware of that. Chair, throughout this unprecedented pandemic, we have been open and transparent about all of the measures we've put forward. Chair, the Prime Minister has pursued a policy of appeasement in pursuit of a personal vanity product at the UN. He's abandoned Israel and committed funding to UNRWA, an organization whose schools have been used as storage facilities for Hamas rockets against Israeli civilians, and whose facilities have served as breeding grounds for racism and anti-Semitism. He has apologized for the Iranian regime when it shot down a plane full of Canadian citizens, and he refuses to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity. What's the point of having a seat at the table if you have to sell out Canadian principles to get there? the chair: The Right Honourable Prime Minister. That's why, when we took office five years ago, we demonstrated the kind of leadership on values that Canadians expected. elizabeth may: This being a committee, we can have a point of order during what would have been question period. I am not sitting that far away from the Prime Minister, and I'm sorry, but Andrew Scheer used to be the Speaker of the House and should show better decorum. Chair, on the same point of order, it is disgusting for the leader of the Green Party to use decorum as an excuse to interrupt the Leader of the Opposition in the middle of critical lines of questioning. The leader of the Green Party knows the rules of the House and shouldn't be abusing them to advance a partisan agenda. andrew scheer: I appreciate the honourable leader of the Green Party, Elizabeth May, for that reminder. I just want to say to the member, and to all members, that the reason that I cannot control myself is that the Prime Minister used the word embarrassment in answering a foreign affairs question, and it just made me think of the India trip. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, while the Greens and the Conservatives are saying that they'll be waiting outside after the meeting, I will ask a question. The Prime Minister has extended the Canada emergency response benefit, and that's good news, but it's not enough. For us, it was also urgent to adjust the CERB to the needs of the tourism, arts and agriculture sectors. So what happened to the urgency of reforming the CERB? Why is the government refusing to talk to the opposition parties? right hon. We have unequivocally proposed to extend the debate to reach an agreement, which brings me to my second question. Last week, the issue of assistance to people with disabilities was also a pressing concern, and it's even more so a week later. The Bloc proposed to extend the discussions and split the government's bill in two to help people with disabilities. Why is the government refusing this assistance to people with disabilities, when it could have been debated with the opposition in a civilized and proper way in a Parliament in which it has a minority? right hon. justin trudeau: That was exactly what we wanted, but unanimous consent of the Chamber was required to debate this matter, and the Conservative Party of Canada voted against it. yves-franois blanchet: If the idea is so good and wonderful, why not start over and open the dialogue now? What's stopping the Prime Minister from being a rallying point and inviting us to take to each other and resolve the problem, rather than saying that he is going to pack up his toys and go home? The people with disabilities are the ones who will pay the price. Where was the Prime Minister on October21,2019? He received a minority mandate from Quebeckers and Canadians. Why is he behaving like something between a prime minister with a majority and a monarch by divine right? right hon. justin trudeau: I've heard the Conservative Party and the Bloc Qubcois throw their accusations around. They don't point out that the House of Commons did indeed give its consent to extend the mandate of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic until the end of June. Unfortunately, they too are part of a minority Parliament and must respect the voice of the majority of parliamentarians, just as we do. yves-franois blanchet: I might have been tempted, but that's unlikely to happen because the Prime Minister isn't me, he's him. In addition, the government wants to buy the right to interfere in provincial and Quebec jurisdictions for $14billion. However, Quebec and a number of provinces are refusing to allow it to interfere in their jurisdictions and are asking that this money be paid to them unconditionally. Is the Prime Minister trying to take advantage of the crisis or is he trying to create a constitutional crisis? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, the safety of Canadians is the responsibility of all levels of government. That's why we have proposed a $14billion agreement to ensure that all Canadians across the country experience a safe re-opening of the economy. This is a proposal that we are working on with the provinces because we know that there are needs across the country, including early childhood centres, screening and support for municipalities. Indigenous leaders have expressed a lack of confidence in the RCMP commissioner's ability to tackle full-scale systemic racism, but the Prime Minister has expressed his confidence in the commissioner. Chair, over the past two years, Commissioner Lucki has made significant strides forward on an issue where there is still much more to do. We know that systemic racism exists in all of our institutions across this country the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. jagmeet singh: This is the same RCMP commissioner who just recently said that they couldn't explain what systemic racism was. Why does the Prime Minister believe that the RCMP commissioner can tackle systemic racism in the RCMP? right hon. Chair, recent events have made it abundantly clear that to tackle the systemic racism at the level of the RCMP, we need a full-scale overhaul of the RCMP. Is the Prime Minister committed to a full-scale overhaul of the RCMP to root out systemic racism? right hon. Chair, I am committed to addressing systemic racism in this country and taking significant, bold actions to reduce the amount of discrimination that indigenous peoples, that racialized Canadians face on a daily basis. What it's saying is that we need to be better at where we spend our money, investing in communities and not policing. Will the Prime Minister commit to a review of the RCMP budget to allocate resources to community services and not to policing? right hon. Chair, over the past years we have been investing more directly and more money in community organizations, in the black community, and working with indigenous partners on the path to reconciliation. We have been investing in the kinds of community-based programs and solutions that are part of the solution. We know there is much more to do, and we will continue to look at all of our expenditures to make sure we're doing the right things. Chair, over the past few years, while the Prime Minister has been in office, the RCMP budget has increased by 31%. In recent events we've seen people who needed a health care response to a health care crisis been killed by the RCMP. Does the Prime Minister believe that we need to be investing in a health care response instead of a police response for people who are faced with a crisis? right hon. We need to make sure that our systems across the board, from our police systems to our judicial systems, to our health care systems, to our community systems, are actually addressing the systemic discrimination issues that are embedded within them That is exactly what we are going to continue to do in the coming years. Chair, with regard to the CERB extension, can the Prime Minister guarantee that everyone who is receiving CERB payments now will continue to do so without any gaps throughout the summer? right hon. Chair, I am happy to highlight that many Canadians who were on the CERB are now returning to work. We know that as the economy gets back to work, people will want to the chair: We will go back to Mr. jagmeet singh: Can the Prime Minister assure people who need it that they will continue to receive the CERB over the summer, yes or no? right hon. justin trudeau: We are very pleased to point out that we are going to extend the Canada emergency response benefit for at least another eight weeks, because a lot of people are going to need it. the chair: We're going to pause and suspend proceedings just for a few moments to allow our support staff to substitute for one another in a healthy and safe way. Chair, it was really a surprise in the middle of a pandemic to see the Prime Minister at his first campaign stop last week in Ottawa. He has a daily report show and he wants to sideline Parliament, dominate the news cycle and keep everyone in the dark about the state of the economy. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, there is no reason that he cannot provide the fiscal update during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PBO has published a number of reports himself. Why won't the Prime Minister provide a fiscal update so we can all understand the state of our economy, or is that just not part of his campaign playbook? hon. mona fortier (minister of middle class prosperity and associate minister of finance): Thank you, Mr. We will continue to be open and transparent about the actions that we are taking to support families, businesses, workers, our health care system and our economy. cathy mcleod: Chair, Canada's economy was in trouble prior to the COVID, with some of the worst numbers since 2009. Government revenues in March dropped by 7.2%, and it's shameful and, quite frankly, it's outrageous that they refuse to provide Parliament and Canadians with an economic update. Households during this challenging time know how much money is coming in and they know how much money is going out. mona fortier: The Canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty due to COVID-19. We've continued to be open and transparent about the measures we've put in place for Canadians, workers and businesses. In fact, we have reported biweekly to Parliament on the total cost and status of our plan's measures. As soon as it's possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide a comprehensive update to Canadians the chair: We go back to Ms. cathy mcleod: Other governments have managed to provide updates for their citizens and carry out their responsibilities, but of course this government has sidelined Parliament with simply a question-but-no-answer period. The forestry industry was in crisis even before the pandemic, with mills closing down and thousands of jobs lost. Eight weeks ago, Minister Freeland said, I have had many discussions with leaders in our forestry sector and the provinces about what we can do to support the industry today. Meanwhile, we've had support going to the arts and we've had support going to fisheries, just to name a few, but arguably for the industry that was having some of the most numerous challenges, it has been radio silence. Can the government at least commit to releasing an updated softwood lumber transition plan before we rise? hon. Chair, we remain committed, of course, to the forestry industry and seeing it through this pandemic and this very uncertain time. The expanding market opportunities program, for instance, has helped Canada's forestry sector diversify, create jobs and open new markets. We've had new construction projects that are active today, using Canadian wood in key markets like Korea, Japan, China and the United States. Tomorrow this House will vote on our government's investment of $20.97 million for this program. It's part of our budget 2019 commitment to invest $251 million over three years, and I hope the opposition will support us in that. cathy mcleod: It was stated in a major newspaper this morning that this government is like a sexy sports carvroom, vroom, vroombut with a history of breakdowns and major repairs. The sector is also an essential link in the medical equipment supply chain, and we thank them for all the work they're doing. We're aware of the immense pressures faced by this sector, especially at this time, and Deputy Prime Minister Freeland and others are taking that seriously and working through this issue. duties on Canadian softwood lumber are unfair and unwarranted, and we will pursue all means in order to the chair: Before continuing, I want to remind honourable members who are at home to make sure that the boom on their headsets is down. grard deltell (louis-saint-laurent, cpc): Mr.Chair, before I ask my question, I'd like to pay tribute to the Minister of Justice, particularly to his versatility. I like Mr.Lametti very much, but I'd like Mr.Morneau to answer my question. Yesterday, in a Senate parliamentary committee, the Minister of Finance half-opened the door to an economic update. Based on what he said, it seems that, as we speak, a committee of the Department of Finance is working on an economic update. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, as we know, the Canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty. As soon as it's possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide a full update to Canadians. Right now, we can say that we have supported workers, businesses and Canadians with the emergency measures we have put in place. We will continue to do so, because we need to be sure that Canadians can get through this crisis. We don't know when the economic update will take place, yet all across Canada, provinces are doing economic updates. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, since the beginning of the crisis, we have implemented the economic action plan to respond to COVID-19, and we've provided immediate assistance to Canadians, businesses and workers. In addition, 8.4million Canadians the chair: We are returning to Mr.Deltell. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, next Friday, the Quebec minister of finance, EricGirard, will give an economic update. If EricGirard can give one for Quebec, why can't BillMorneau give one for Canada? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, once again, we have been open and transparent from the outset. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, I cannot judge the quality of the work done by the provinces, but what I do know is that Quebec, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland have also made efforts to support their residents economically. We have reported biweekly to Parliament on the total cost and status of the measures in our economic response plan. Once again, as soon as clear economic projections can be provided, we will provide an update the chair: Mr.Deltell has the floor. So I ask the question: so far, over the past three months, how much has the pandemic cost Canadians? hon. mona fortier: As I said earlier, it is important to note that we have put forward measures, including the wage subsidy, which have helped more than 2.5million the chair: Mr.Deltell has the floor. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, I have been trying for four minutes to get anything remotely resembling an answer, and I'm getting absolutely nothing. Why are the government and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, not able to table an economic update when some provinces are able to? hon. We have continued to support businesses and Canadians during this time the chair: Mr.Deltell, you have time for a very brief question. grard deltell: The only thing that distinguishes the provinces that table economic updates and the current government is political will. As soon as it is possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide Canadians with a full update. The difference between our government and the previous government is that we will actually consult with Canadians, including black Canadians, including Asian Canadians, to respond to the challenges, including with an anti-racism secretariat and an anti-racism strategy. Chair, this program was made possible by working with the provinces, and we will continue to encourage landlords and tenants to work together to make sure they have relief for this very difficult time in which they're living. We're continuing to monitor the CECRA program and we will make it possible for businesses to have access to the program. What is it going to take for the government to admit that the program is a disaster and needs changes? hon. Chair, we know our government has been working closely with the provinces and territories to deliver the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance. Although the tenant-landlord relationship is ultimately the responsibility of the provinces and territories, our government has stepped up to provide support through the tools we have and through CMHC so that small businesses can get the rent relief they need. At committee, we were told only around 5,500 of them are receiving COVID-19 rent relief. We will continue to monitor this program closely and ensure that Canada's small businesses are supported during this challenging time. Chair, I want to assure the honourable colleague that we are doing everything and will continue to do everything to help small businesses in our country. Chair, on May 27 the CBSA seized 65 small handguns at Pearson airport, the largest firearms seizure on record. Chair, I would point out that gun violence in any of our communities is unacceptable, and it's important that governments and communities take steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals. That's why we do important work at our border to keep guns from being smuggled into our country, but it also necessitates additional work. That's why our government has taken a very strong position and will strengthen gun control to keep Canadians safe. We know the Liberals' gun ban won't change anything, but a focus on smuggled guns and criminals will. Chair, stronger gun control laws are an effective tool, and that's been told to us by police leadership and communities across the country. is a strong partner of Canada, as is the European Union, and we're looking forward to continuing that strong relationship the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. With respect to the negotiations with the U.K., when will the minister publish her goals and objectives for this agreement? hon. Chair, we're going to continue to work to ensure that any future agreement is going to be based on the best interests of Canadians, and we will the chair: We will go back to Mr. randy hoback: Can the minister confirm whether they've entered into negotiations with the U.K. mary ng: Our government is analyzing the most-favoured-nation tariff regimes schedule the U.K. Chair, during the CUSMA negotiations, a deal was struck between the Liberal Party and the NDP that the government would notify this House 90 days before it starts any negotiations on any trade agreement. Right now, we are analyzing the most-favoured-nation tariff regimes schedule put out by the U.K. Has the minister discussed a WTO reform with the USTR, the United States trade representative? hon. mary ng: The Ottawa Group is a consensus-based group limited to WTO members who are committed to bringing forward ideas and proposals the chair: We'll go back to Mr. randy hoback: Just as with any other trade agreement, the minister has committed to this House that she will publish the list of goals and responsibilities for the negotiations. Chair, I'm thrilled that we had an excellent meeting of the Ottawa Group yesterday where, as a group, we agreed to take concrete action. randy hoback: Will the minister be releasing a list of Canada's objectives we would like to see the new WTO's director-general pursue prior to the upcoming DG election? hon. I would remind the member that we have access to a billion and a half customers through our very robust mr. randy hoback: A billion and a half customers is fine if you have a functioning WTO, but if you don't have a functioning WTO, then a billion and a half customers may not be fully accessible to our suppliers, manufacturers and agriculture producers. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that nothing is more important than standing up and helping create markets for our Canadian businesses and to help our small businesses get more export-ready so that they can grow into the international marketplace. This is work that we've committed to do, and we will keep working on it, particularly the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Not only did they present the budget, but they'll also actually debate the budget and pass the budget in Parliament. Chair, the House is sitting in this hybrid format so that people can participate in the House on the screens. I'm sure my colleague is happy to see that his own colleagues are able to ask questions and participate. New Brunswick families and businesses are rapidly making adjustments to manage and live with the coronavirus pandemic. Chair, our government is committed to ensuring that Canadians continue to have access to the benefits that they rely on through Service Canada. We have redeployed over 3,000 additional staff to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to their benefits. We've established a 1,500-agent call centre to make sure that people can get access to the phone lines to get the help they need. Provincial governments are working hard to adjust to Canada's new normal by opening up businesses and front-line government services. Chair, we're currently working with our world-class public health experts to determine how best to reopen the Service Canada network for the public. Make no mistake: Our Service Canada employees have gone above and beyond to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to the services that they rely on and the benefits that they need. john williamson: Please don't hide behind health experts when the Prime Minister is appearing in the middle of large protests, yet is afraid to bring back the Parliament of Canada to do its business. Bills are being studied, opposition input is being heard and MLAs are voting on legislation, not rubber-stamping government bills. When will the government table an economic update so taxpayers understand what was spent, what is owed by our kids and grandchildren, and what the government's fiscal footing looks like? hon. The only reason my colleague is able to ask a question and I'm able to answer his question is that he's right there on the screen. We have this hybrid format that cares for MPs across the country, not only the ones sitting in the House. When will the government table an economic update so that taxpayers understand what was spent, what is owed by our kids and grandchildren, and what the government's fiscal footing looks like in today's environment? hon. We have been open and transparent about the measures we have been providing to support families, businesses and workers. Again I will ask when the government will table an economic update so that we can have an understanding of what the government's fiscal footing looks like. Chair, we have included biweekly reports to Parliament on the full cost and status of our economic response plan measures since the beginning. I have said, and I will continue to say, that when it is possible to provide a clear economic projection, we will provide an update. john williamson: What is the full cost to date of the government's COVID-19 relief measures, as the minister just claimed the government has provided to Parliament? hon. Chair, we have provided support for workers, and 2.5 million Canadians have been helped through the Canadian wage subsidy. stphane bergeron: Mr.Chair, as the leader of the Bloc Qubcois mentioned a few moments ago, the government promised $14billion to Quebec and the provinces, but in targeted transfers. But Quebec and the provinces don't just want this money to be transferred unconditionally, they also want a real discussion on a permanent increase in health care transfers. The federal government, which does not manage any hospitals or long-term care centres, must stop playing armchair quarterback and transfer the money to the only governments with jurisdiction over health, that is, Quebec and the provinces. Will it do so without delay and without nitpicking? the honourable patty hajdu (minister of health): Mr.Chair, we know that the Government of Quebec is working hard to ensure the safety of Quebeckers and we are here to support them. As part of this co-operation, we have developed health and safety recommendations for workplaces, we have purchased medical equipment for workers and we have supported the province in developing its reopening program. stphane bergeron: The co-operation is so effective that the money is staying in the federal government's coffers. We see it with housing, for which Quebec has not received a dime of the $1.4billion it is owed. pablo rodriguez: I am pleased to confirm to my colleague that there is no messing around, no quibbling, nothing of the kind. There is a clear willingness on the part of the federal government to co-operate with Quebec and all the provinces. stphane bergeron: We don't want to bicker, we want the money to be paid out. There is $1.4billion that should be paid to Quebec for social housing and is sitting in the federal government's coffers. We are waiting for money for water treatment and water systems, but it is sitting in the federal government's coffers. What is the government waiting for to pay out the money so that we can get our economy rolling? hon. stphane bergeron: MadamChair, things are definitely at a standstill, because the money is owed and has not been paid out. We need more flexibility in the gas tax program and Quebec's contribution to allow municipalities to undertake work on city halls, community centres and fire stations. We need the federal government to contribute to funding public transit operations, which have become a real financial drain because of the drop in ridership. pablo rodriguez: When it comes to just talking, the Bloc Qubcois has a lot of experience, I admit. iqra khalid (mississaugaerin mills, lib.): Madam Chair, I'll be splitting my time with the member for GlengarryPrescottRussell. During a consultation with the business community in Mississauga, the concerns of businesses, big and small, included the need for stable, affordable and safe child care. With the lack of such child care spaces, an economic recovery plan post-COVID cannot be effective until and unless we make sure that people are able to get back to work. I've heard from parents across Mississauga that they're being forced to stay home because of inadequate child care and that they have to choose between putting food on the table and keeping family safe. More and more employers are realizing that good employees are unable to contribute to their business growth because of this challenge. Now more than ever, we need to find long-term sustainable solutions for Canadians who face challenges with regard to child care. I ask our Minister of Families, Children and Social Development this: What is our strategy to tackle this ever-growing need for a national child care plan? hon. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I thank the honourable member for her question and for her important advocacy and work on this important issue. That is why we're committed to continuing to work with provinces and territories to renew our agreements on early learning and child care, and to provide, at the earliest opportunity, $400 million in support. In addition to that, the Prime Minister has already indicated that child care will be part of the $14-billion pledge to provinces and territories to assist them with respect to COVID-19 recovery efforts. Over the next decade, we will continue to invest $7.5 billion, and together we have achieved the goal of over 40,000 affordable child care spaces. We are also committed to continuing to create over 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces for kids under the age of 10. We will continue to work with our partners in the provinces and territories to ensure that Canadians can continue to have access to safe, quality and affordable child care. francis drouin (glengarryprescottrussell, lib.): MadamChair, small businesses play a fundamental role in the Canadian economy. In an article in LaPresse, the Minister of Economic Development warned us that the economic crisis caused by severe lockdown measures could have more serious consequences in small municipalities than in large cities. Based on discussions with the chambers of commerce in my riding, it is clear that federal government assistance will be essential for the reopening of the economy, specifically for the rural economy. In fact, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Prescott-Russell community development corporation , under the leadership of John Candie. After announcing almost $57million to help SMEs adopt e-commerce, how does the minister plan to help SMEs and the business community in our rural areas? hon. mlanie joly (minister of economic development and official languages): MadamChair, I also thank my colleague from GlengarryPrescottRussell for his important question. It is also why we have doubled the budget of CFDCs and Community Futures organizations across the country.  In southern Ontario we have reinvested over $260million in the regional economic development agency FedDev. In the great riding of GlengarryPrescottRussell, which I am particularly fond of and where there is a very good member of Parliament, there is an additional $1million for entrepreneurs in the region. carol hughes): The honourable member for GlengarryPrescottRussell has 36seconds left. daniel blaikie (elmwoodtranscona, ndp): Thank you very much, Madam Chair. She has been working from home since late March, taking care of her child, who is out of school, and caring for her father, who is living with her and vulnerable to COVID-19. As a parent and a care provider to a vulnerable person, she's not comfortable with physically returning to work. Service Canada won't give Krystal a straight answer as to whether going on leave and collecting CERB would count as refusing a reasonable job offer. With Bill C-17 looming in the background, Krystal is worried about jail time and fines if she does right by her child and her father by applying for CERB. Can Krystal reasonably refuse to go back to work and collect CERB, or will she be considered a fraudster? That's my question for the minister that is specific to Krystal's case. As well, what is the minister doing to provide clear direction to Canadians and to Service Canada agents so that people can get a clear answer before making their decision about returning to work? hon. We recognize that Canadian workers will face various different situations, including those who are ineligible for the Canada emergency support benefit. We'll continue to work with workers to make sure they're able to be supported throughout this pandemic. daniel blaikie: Madam Chair, that answer is really not good enough, because the problem here is that Krystal needs to know whether she can continue receiving CERB or not. That's a federal government decision, and she needs to know whether the federal government is going to accuse her of fraud and put her in jail or assess fines against her if she refuses to go back to work because she wants to take care of her child and her father. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I can assure the honourable member that if a Canadian has to take care of a loved one due to circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, they are indeed eligible to receive the CERB and remain receiving that benefit. laurel collins (victoria, ndp): As we deal with the global pandemic, we cannot lose sight of the ongoing climate emergency. Canada has missed every single climate target it set, and we need to break the cycle of empty promises. Canadians want their government to be accountable, and environmental groups such as Ecojustice, CAN-Rac, Environmental Defence and West Coast Environmental Law, as well as the government's own climate institute, are all calling for legally binding climate targets. When will the government put its climate targets into law with legally binding milestones so we never miss another target again? hon. navdeep bains (mississaugamalton, lib.): Madam Chair, I thank my honourable colleague for her question. It is a priority not only for us as a government, but it should be a priority for all Canadians. That is why we have a comprehensive plan that also includes significant investments in clean technology, which will help reduce our carbon footprint. I am confident that these measures will enable us to not only meet but exceed our 2030 target and also allow us to achieve our net-zero 2050 target. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I think the fundamental issue here is having a plan when it comes to the environment. I'm confident that the measures that we have takenputting a price on pollution, investing in clean technology, and other key measures to reduce our carbon footprint, including the investment in infrastructureunderpin a plan the acting chair (mrs. laurel collins: This government is not meeting its targets, but it is meeting with oil and gas lobbyists. Are we going to choose a just recovery with good, sustainable jobs for Canadian workers, or are we going to keep subsidizing oil and gas companies to the tune of billions, subsidies that we know are ending up in the pockets of CEOs and shareholders? the acting chair (mrs. navdeep bains: Again, Madam Chair, this is the fundamental difference between us and the NDP. We fundamentally believe that the entire economy needs to work together, including the energy sector, to enable us to achieve those 2030 and 2050 targets. We are going to work together to support our workers, including in the energy sector, to reduce our carbon footprint. When I was last here in May, I was on my way back to Saskatoon from Toronto, and there was actually someone on my flight who tested positive for COVID-19. Why hasn't the government put rules in place requiring airlines to reach out to individuals like me who may have been exposed to COVID on their flights? hon. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, it's hard to speculate on what happened from such a vague description of his experience, but I will say that we have every confidence in local public health, which is doing the hard and heavy lifting of contact tracing and working very closely with all kinds of different sectors, including airline sectors, to make sure that close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are found, are traced and are isolated. I assume that the member took appropriate precautions on the flight and I hope that he continues to do so. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, it was reported that the individual on my plane who had COVID was actually connecting in Toronto from an international flight. The Prime Minister announced last week that they would begin mandating temperature checks for those bound for Canada in July. Will international travellers be tested when they land in Canada, or will they be relying on the tests that take place in other countries? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, this is a very important question, because the protection and safety of all Canadiansin particular, Canadian travellersis a high priority for our government. That will initially be done primarily by the airlines that are in the best position to do it at this point in time. We are also now going to be including CATSA, the people who do the security screening, so that when people enter the airport, they will also be screened. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, last week five of the largest professional sports leagues in North America put out a statement of support for my private member's bill, the safe and regulated sports betting act. Given the struggles that clubs and leagues are facing due to COVID-19, including having no fans at all in the stands for the foreseeable future, the legalization of sports betting would be a welcome opportunity not only to engage fans but to generate much-needed revenue. Will the government commit now to supporting the sports and gaming industries by supporting my private member's bill, Bill C-218? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, I've had the opportunity on many occasions to speak to members of Parliament and also to mayors and councillors and people living in border communities where there are casinos. I would like to advise the member that I look forward to the opportunity for a careful examination of his bill. At the same time, we will examine his bill with all of the necessary attention to make sure it's given full consideration. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, it's the first time in history that we've had the five professional leagues in this country joining together for this bill. I've heard major concerns from a number of newspapers in this country about competition they're receiving today from Canada Post, which is offering massive free postage services. In fact, I have one of their ads here, which says that the first 6,000 pieces of postage are 100% free. If the government is genuine about wanting to ensure that newspapers and journals can succeed in this country, why are you allowing Canada Post to use its monopoly power to actually threaten local newspapers in this country? hon. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Thank you, Madame Chair, and I thank the member opposite for his question. As you well know, a healthy news and media sector in Canada is a priority for our government, which is why we have put in place a number of measures before COVID-19 and during COVID-19, and we will continue to be there for them after this crisis has gone by. carol hughes): Before we go on, we will be taking a break to do a bit of a changeover. Blair stated yesterday here in the House that the AR-15 has been used in mass killings in Canada on many occasions. Blair, please provide just one specific instance in which an AR-15 was used in a mass killing in Canada. I think this is an excellent opportunity to point out to the member opposite how important it is to actually listen to what was said. If you go back and review that tape, and I would invite you to do so, you'll see that I said the AR-15 and other weapons like themreferring of course to military-style assault weaponshave been used in mass killings, and I actually cited a number of examples. Madam Chair, I think it would be very useful if the member's questions were based on facts. Blair that I actually have watched the video a couple of times, and he specifically states that the AR-15 was used in mass killings in Canada, yet he has yet to provide one. Out of the recently banned firearms on May 1, how many have been or are still currently in use by the Canadian Armed Forces? hon. bill blair: That's an excellent question, Madam Chair, because it's very important to provide Canadians with clarity. I asked him a question on whether any of them is being or ever has been used in the Canadian Armed Forces. Are any of the recently banned firearms still in use, or have they ever been in use, in any military in the world? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, I think it's important to also recognize that the basic origin, the provenance of the weapons that we have prohibited, was in their original design. As I've said previously, they were designed for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers. alex ruff: As someone who has used many military-style firearms and who is actually involved in helping define what we purchase in the military, I would use none of the ones that are currently prohibited. Can he please confirm whether Veterans Affairs has a plan to address the claims backlog, yes or no? hon. lawrence macaulay (minister of veterans affairs): Madam Chair, I appreciate my honourable colleague's question, and yes, we've indicated that it's a major priority. That's why I'm so pleased that the supplementary estimates contained just under $90 million to address hiring more staff, improving the process and making sure that we attack the backlog in an appropriate manner. lawrence macaulay: Well, Madam Chair, I can assure you that it's in the supplementary estimates, and of course, this money is the acting chair (mrs. lawrence macaulay: Madam Chair, I can tell my honourable colleague that the money is in the supplementary estimates, and with the money we're able to attack this problem in an appropriate manner, and that's what is important for our veterans. alex ruff: The deputy minister committed on March 10 that a written plan would be provided to the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs within a month and made public. lawrence macaulay: Madame Chair, I'm sure my honourable colleague wants an appropriate plan and he would be fully aware this just under $90 million would make a big difference in the plan to attack the backlog. Therefore, my question is, if the deputy minister in the department provided him with an appropriate plan or a written plan, why is he questioning how appropriate that plan is? I have complete confidence in the deputy minister's ability to produce a written plan. lawrence macaulay: I can assure my honourable colleague that with the appropriate funding, we will address the backlog in Veterans Affairs. carol hughes): We will go now to the honourable member for Parry SoundMuskoka, Mr. Three weeks ago, I asked this government if the finance minister would meet with the beleaguered summer camp sector. Summer camps, which are a social and economic mainstay in Parry SoundMuskoka and all of northern Ontario, have been crippled by the global pandemic. Aside from a brief follow-up conversation over the phone with the junior minister, there has still been no action from this government. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I recognize the honourable member's important question and his focus on summer camps. We will continue to engage with them, as we have, to ensure and find ways in which we can get their feedback and find ways in which we can support them. That work is ongoing, and I assure the honourable member that our focus is on the kids and on ensuring that they have access to summer camps for this year. The summer camps association has given lots of feedback and my office has given lots of feedback, so I don't see what's confusing about this. However, I've become accustomed to not really getting answers to questions, so I will go to the next one. The Ontario government's regional reopening plan permits cruise boats to resume on Georgian Bay, yet the federal government is refusing to allow these vessels to operate until July 1. Therefore, small businesses such as the Island Queen cruiser in Parry Sound, which has only a very few precious weeks to operate in the first place, is losing yet another two weeks because of federal inaction. Will the Minister of Transport take a regional approach himself by lifting the federal ban on Georgian Bay, just like the Province of Ontario has done? the acting chair (mrs. There have been a number of very important discussions with the provinces, in particular with the Province of Ontario, around provisions regarding pleasure craft. We're working very closely with our provincial counterparts to address this issue, but we want to ensure that it will be done safely. scott aitchison: Madam Chair, I actually gave the minister a heads-up that I would be asking that question. He sent me an email today saying he was not going to be able to be in the House, and it's great of him to do that. He said that whoever was going to fill in for him would have an answer, but again, that was not really an answer. The next issue I would like to bring this government's attention to is the deplorable state of rural Internet service in Parry SoundMuskoka. Quite simply, there are too many gaps in service, and what is available is generally way too expensive. We have families trying to work and teach their kids from home on unreliable and outrageously expensive Internet service, and we have too many small businesses that either cannot access or afford reliable Internet services. Today Greg Rickford, the Ontario energy minister, and Laurie Scott, Ontario Minister of Infrastructure, announced $2.3 million for seven northern Ontario broadband projects. Minister, will when your government get serious and become a reliable partner for the Government of Ontario and the private sector to deliver this crucial modern-day infrastructure to rural Canadians? the acting chair (mrs. carol hughes): I remind the member that he needs to address the questions and comments to the chair. maryam monsef (minister for women and gender equality and rural economic development): Madam Chair, in the best of times, life without access to high-speed Internet is hard. Our government's unprecedented investments are already connecting a million more Canadian households to this essential service, but until we achieve universal access our work is not done. We will work with our partners, including provinces across the country, to connect every Canadian household to high-quality Internet access that is affordable and reliable. I'm wondering, then, Madam Chair, since the Province of Ontario has used the Northern Ontario Heritage Corporation Fund to make this announcement, what about using FedNor to make the same kind of announcement, and partner with the province? the acting chair (mrs. mlanie joly: Obviously we believe in the importance of northern Ontario; that's why we nearly doubled the budget of FedNor. We will continue to invest in businesses and people all around Parry Sound, Muskoka and northern Ontario. If my colleague has specific projects in mind, please come and see me and let's have a conversation. carol hughes): The honourable member for Montmagny-L'Islet-KamouraskaRivire-du-Loup, Mr.Gnreux, has the floor. bernard gnreux (montmagnyl'isletkamouraskarivire-du-loup, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. During this pandemic, we are realizing the extent to which reliable high-speed Internet service is needed for Canada's economy. There are still places where telework is not possible today because of the lack of adequate coverage. Benot Pilotto, who is the mayor of Saint-Onsime-d'Ixworth, in my riding, wrote to me a few days ago. That is why I am asking you what concrete results the government plans to achieve for our rural areas by the end of the year. maryam monsef: At the best of times, life without high-speed Internet access is difficult. bernard gnreux: MadamChair, I am simply asking the minister to tell me when the mayor of Saint-Onsime-d'Ixworth will be able to tell his residents when the Internet will be available in his municipality. What does the government plan to do so that rural municipalities across Canada can have access to the Internet as soon as possible? What is its plan? hon. maryam monsef: We are working with partners across the country to ensure that every Canadian household is connected to a high-quality, accessible and affordable high-speed Internet service.  Madam Chair, I assure my colleagues that we share the same goal, and we will work with all our partners across the country to ensure every Canadian household has access the acting chair (mrs. According to the government's plan, when will rural Canadian businesses and households be connected? the acting chair (mrs. maryam monsef: Madam Chair, those plans are under way, and we will have more to share in the coming days. bernard gnreux: It seems that the Minister of Rural Economic Development plans to announce a new plan this week. Can she tell us how this program will differ from the Connect to Innovate program, which is already in place? Can the minister tell us whether her program will solve the problem of the 25square kilometre hexagonal zones, which unfortunately make many projects ineligible for the CRTC's broadband fund? hon. maryam monsef: Madam Chair, I'm pleased to share with my colleague that the model he's referring to, the hexagon model, is no more. bernard gnreux: MadamChair, this year, the Canada summer jobs program is a real fiasco. On May13, 100jobs were announced in my riding; on May20, 16jobs were announced; on May27, 13jobs were announced; on June3, 12jobs were announced; and on June10, only one job was announced. Can we have an announcement, once and for all? Let's stop the piecemeal announcements and finally confirm the remaining jobs today so that our organizations can have young people before the summer starts on the weekend. We recognize the important role that the Canada summer jobs program is playing in supporting employers and young workers in communities right across the country. Our government is working very hard to help employers adapt to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the same time is supporting young Canadians as they begin to look for summer employment. We've introduced flexibilities into the program to ensure that more young workers have opportunities to get employed. The honourable member also has to understand that we're in the COVID-19 pandemic, and as such it will take some time for businesses to equip themselves to hire students. Addiction is a health and social issue, but criminalization creates stigma, so people hide their drug use and die alone. Access to a safe supply of drugs and safe injection sites saves lives and puts addicts in daily contact with people who can help them. Will this government end the war on drugs by decriminalizing them, providing a safe supply and reallocating resources from policing addicts to providing treatment for them? hon. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, I think it's really important we make sure that when we speak about people who use substances, we remove stigmatizing language like the word addict. We can stand together, as this government has, with people who use substances and their families to ensure a range of options for people who are struggling with addiction, who are using substances in a way that is harming their health and their communities. Madam Chair, we're working with communities to make sure there are more community-based approaches to treating the acting chair (mrs. paul manly: Madam Chair, the Geneva Convention considers both tear gas and pepper spray to be chemical weapons and prohibits their use in war, yet our police forces use these weapons on Canadian civilians. Will the government prohibit the use of these weapons and require police to use de-escalation techniques to keep legal protests peaceful? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, the right to peaceful protest in this country is a constitutionally protected right. At the same time, Madam Chair, we recognize that the use of even less than lethal force can have significant impacts on people's safety. It's prohibited for non-police use, and for the police it is and should be highly regulated. paul manly: Madam Chair, in 2012 the RCMP spent $14 million on 18 armoured personnel carriers. Will the government rein in the RCMP budget and end wasteful spending on militarizing our civilian police forces? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, it's a very important tradition that our Canadian police are not militarized. At the same time, we've seen a number of tragedies when police have responded to situations in which people were armed with weapons designed for soldiers to kill soldiers, and they've been used to kill police officers. The militarization of our society, so strongly promoted by some, is the direct consequence of the militarization of the police. As we remove these weapons from our society and prohibit them, we'll make it safer for everyone and we can then move away from such a model of policing. paul manly: Madam Chair, the government spent $4.5 billion to buy an old, leaky pipeline. How much is this spill going to cost Canadian taxpayers to clean up? How much contingency funding has been budgeted to repair the environmental destruction from spills? hon. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I want to thank the honourable colleague for his question. He full well knows that the acquisition that we made with regard to the TMX initiative is a reflection of the fact that we want this initiative to move forward in a sustainable manner and in a manner that protects the environment. I'll continue to work with my colleagues to endeavour to make sure that we have the appropriate processes in place to protect the environment and at the same time create good-quality, middle-class jobs for Canadians. carol hughes): The honourable member for RosemontLa PetitePatrie, Mr.Boulerice, has the floor. alexandre boulerice (rosemontla petite-patrie, ndp): Thank you, MadamChair. In Montreal, the city and the police department have recognized this, and measures will be put in place. Although it spends $10million a day, we see no attempt to reform or change the RCMP. If the Prime Minister really wants to act, why is he delaying the action plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls? hon. bill blair: Let me assure this House and the member opposite that we're not dragging our feet. Indigenous people, black Canadians and other racialized people are far too often experiencing systemic racism and disparate outcomes through the criminal justice system. It's incumbent upon all of us who work within the criminal justice system to take the steps and actions necessary to produce more equitable outcomes. All police services, including the RCMP, must be committed to ensuring that the people they're sworn to serve and protect are always treated with dignity and respect. alexandre boulerice: MadamChair, why are the Liberals taking indigenous children to court to challenge the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling in their favour? hon. marc miller (minister of indigenous services): Madam Chair, as the honourable member knows full well, a number of cases are pending, and we are currently negotiating with the parties. We are making progress, and I would be delighted to tell the member and the House about it in response to a later question. alexandre boulerice: We've been asking questions about it for months, and as I see it, we should keep doing so. The Prime Minister's new pipeline, which taxpayers were forced to buy with their hard-earned money, has leaked. Some 190,000litres of oil spilled, and we can't even make the company pay for it because the Liberals bought the pipeline. Trans-Mountain, KeystoneXL and the resumption of gas exploration and development off the coast of Newfoundland and Labradorare these the projects the Liberals had in mind for their green recovery? hon. Our priority was to protect the health and safety of Canadians throughout the pandemic, especially when it comes to the environment. That's why environmental and climate change laws aimed at protecting the environment, human health and conservation will remain in force. Unions, associations, artists and creators have all taken part in public demonstrations recently to condemn the lack of a specific plan for the living arts, performing arts and festival sector. alexandre boulerice: Well, that wasn't at all what the artists and creators who were out demonstrating in the streets a few days ago thought. The CERB extension announced by the government only brings us to September, but the cultural community is expecting the worst in the fall. steven guilbeault: I'm not so sure those who were protesting last week had issues with our government, but we'd certainly be happy to speak with them. As for a long-term plan, we are currently consulting arts and culture stakeholders to contemplate together how the government can help the sector in response to the ongoing crisis. We are working on finding solutions, but until we have long-term solutions, we have seen to it that our artists and organizations have access to funding until September. carol hughes): The honourable member for BeauportLimoilou, Mrs.Vignola, has the floor. julie vignola (beauportlimoilou, bq): Madam Chair, I will be sharing my time with the member for Montcalm. According to the latest news, Seaspan Shipyards will be spending an additional $1.5billion to build two ships. anita anand (minister of public services and procurement): I'd like to thank the member for her question. Davie is certainly a strong and trusted partner that works very hard to help our government get results for Canadians. Building a new class of ships is highly complex, and it's not unusual for cost estimates to change throughout the procurement project. It's important to make sure additional funding is available for the joint support ships project to ensure the navy's vessels are delivered. In the beginning, eight years ago, the project was supposed to cost $2.6billion. Why haven't the ships been delivered yet? Why is Davie still not seen as a trusted partner? the acting chair (mrs. anita anand: Once again, I would point out that building a new class of ships is highly complex, and it's not unusual for the cost estimate to change for a procurement project as large as this one. carol hughes): It is now over to the honourable member for Montcalm, Mr.Thriault. luc thriault (montcalm, bq): Madam Chair, in Quebec, 12,000people have begun their training to work in residential and long-term care centres. The dedication of the members of the armed forces is paramount, and I want to extend my heartfelt thanks. What does the army have to do right now that is more important than helping our caregivers save lives? hon. pablo rodriguez: Madam Chair, I'm glad my fellow member recognizes the fundamental role the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces have played and continue to play in residential and long-term care centres and many other areas in support of our seniors. luc thriault: We are short 12,000people, so if the Red Cross wants to help us, all the better. I repeat my question: What does the army have to do 10days from now that is more important if it's not to help caregivers save lives? hon. The people at the Canadian Red Cross are well-trained paid workers who can perform the same work in partnership with the members of the armed forces, who can stay in Quebec as well. Right now, we are working with the Quebec government and discussing how we can keep the measure in place until September15. What does the army have to do that is more important than helping caregivers save the lives of those who built Quebec? the acting chair (mrs. carol hughes): The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons is asked to keep his answer brief. pablo rodriguez: Madam Chair, the Government of Canada is there and will continue to be there to help the people who built Quebec. Madam Chair, on May 14 I asked the Minister of Agriculture when the Liberal government would put aside its usual campaign rhetoric and recognize the very detrimental impact the carbon tax is having on farmers across this country. Minister Bibeau proudly noted that according to their data, the average cost of the carbon tax per farm across Canada is $210 to $819. The fact is that the Liberal government's own Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated that at $25 per tonne, the cost for an 855-acre crop farm in Alberta is well over $6,000. When will this Liberal government come clean with Canadians and recognize the disastrous impact the carbon tax is having on Canada's critical agriculture and agri-food sector? hon. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): Madam Chair, our pollution pricing policy is designed to grow a clean economy. Farm fuels and fuels from cardlock facilities are exempt, and there is a partial rebate for propane and natural gas used in commercial greenhouses. We will do a review of our pollution pricing system in 2020, focused on competitiveness issues in trade-exposed industries such as agriculture. It is also important to remember that this is about tackling climate change and that 100% of the revenues stay in the province. earl dreeshen: Madam Chair, Minister Bibeau keeps talking about wanting to protect Canadians' environment. Well, the truth is that Canada's farmers, ranchers and processors have for years demonstrated their ability to deliver meaningful reductions in emissions and to safeguard the environment through the adoption of new technologies, education and innovative management practices, but the government ignores these efforts. Will the minister at the very least admit to Canadians that Canadian farmers are unable to pass on the cost of the carbon tax to consumers and instead have to absorb those extra costs out of their own pockets? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Madam Chair, allow me to explain again our government's position on pollution pricing. Madam Chair, Minister Bibeau has repeatedly asked stakeholders to send her data about the impacts of the carbon tax on farmers, so this is exactly what they have been doing. The Atlantic Grains Council, the Grain Farmers of Ontario, Producteurs de grains du Qubec and the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association issued a joint statement at the beginning of this year in which they estimated that the cumulative indirect inflation of carbon tax on farm costs will be $14.50 an acre this year, with that cost escalating by more than double by 2022 to almost $30 an acre. Why does the Liberal government continue to ignore the facts presented to it and continue to misrepresent the truth to Canadians? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Madame Chair, I can assure you that we have paid close attention to all the information that has been provided to us and that our calculation was also based on this information provided by provinces and different stakeholders. Marie-Claude Bibeau:as well as the 2019 agricultural tax data to estimate the average cost of pollution pricing associated with grain drying at up to 0.4% of overall operating costs. Dreeshen, I am watching the time, and the minister is allowed to answer for the same amount of time that you used to ask the question"
