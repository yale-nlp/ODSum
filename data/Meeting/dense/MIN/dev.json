        "Query": "What were the Professor's thoughts on the results and clustering in language generation?",
        "Summary": "Summary:\nThe professor expressed surprise at the better-than-expected results and concluded that MSG had no impact. However, he observed that the inclusion of French and Spanish in the multilingual English model had a negative effect. The professor was not enthusiastic about clustering and suggested giving more weight to the most promising bands in the model. Currently, the model treated all bands equally. In terms of the SmartKom generation module, the syntax-to-prosody rules for English will be rewritten, and OGI will provide a variety of synthesizer voices to choose from.",
        "Article": "professor a: We 're not recording yet , are we ? grad g: Well , I don't think phd f: No , that that wasn't recorded . phd f: I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something . phd f: I was just noticing a big s professor d: So are we recording now ? Is this phd e: Yeah . professor d: So , what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ? grad g: I think that phd e: It 's a good idea . grad g: u usually we 've done that and also we 've s done digits as well , but I forgot to print any out . Besides with this big a group , phd b: You can write them on the board , if you want . I it 'd be even better with this big grad g: it would take too much time . phd e: Mari ? postdoc h: What professor a: What ? professor d: It 's not that long . professor d: w u phd e: So that thing the little th that part should be pointing upwards . professor a: It 's kind of professor d: Oh , yeah , the element , yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection , and , you you put up there data format , professor a:  . professor d: and other tasks during data collection , professor a: So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get professor d: and professor a: what can you add to it to get , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like grad g: especially for querying . postdoc h: Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , i  , if he I ,  if he has s I I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? grad g: Landay . postdoc h: La - Landay ? So he has , these , tsk note - taking things , professor a:   postdoc h: then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . professor a: Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or  , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . grad g: But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , postdoc h:   And so , you know phd f: the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up professor a: So grad g: pretty easily . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things . So , if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . professor d: I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . professor a: But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? professor d: No , not a No , I just My mind went elsewhere . So , yeah , I 'm Morgan , and where am I ? I 'm on channel three . postdoc h: Should we have used pseudo - names ? Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . professor d: I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel phd e: Let me , turn that off . grad g: And , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z phd e: Oh . phd e: PDM - right , PZA - right PDA - right , PDA - left . grad g: Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . postdoc h: I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say \" Jimlet \" and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? You know , the Jimlet  , the box that contains the professor d: Well , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know . professor d: we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?  , do we have s people write summaries ? Everybody or one person ? And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? Is that phd f: There 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? professor a: Right . phd f: that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . phd f: But there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . professor d: There 's there 's another problem grad g: And professor d: which is , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . And , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group and and , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , \" OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , the summar \" grad g: Well , I asked them to and none of them did . grad g: So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting postdoc h:   grad g: So I didn't track them down and say \" please do th do it now \" . professor d: I I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , professor a: Right . professor d: as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . grad g: I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say \" that 's important , that might be a query \" . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , there are certain key words like , you know , \" action item \" and things like that , which could be used in , t to some degree finding the structure . phd e: Although professor a: W postdoc h: And and I also , was thinking , with reference to the n  , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , I think they should be recorded instead of written because I think that , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . professor a: How about this idea ? That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . professor a: And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? postdoc h: Yeah . grad g: that gives you a summary but it doesn't really How do you generate queries from that ? phd e: Well . But , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . phd b: Actually And so grad g: James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me . professor d: Well , I think that we  , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings professor a: Well professor d: and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed grad g: Yep . professor d: And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and at the very least . So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . phd b: you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . phd b: It may not be kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important . phd b: And that wouldn't take any extra postdoc h: That 's a nice idea . phd b: Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad professor d: It professor c:   It 's professor d: That 's a good idea but that doesn't Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? professor a: Well , what it does phd b: Well , then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . phd b: And grad g: y professor a: I I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se , but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say \" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? \" phd b: Yeah . professor d: That that 's what  , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , \" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? \" , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . phd e: Well , see , there are th professor a: I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , when  , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . phd b: At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords professor d: Maybe . grad g: i this would tell you what the hit is , phd b: and grad g: not what the query is . grad g: And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , professor a: Right . grad g: but phd b: We don't even know what  , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user , professor d:   professor d: Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that phd b:  . professor d: because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in in i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of of of queries . So he 's just sort of going \" where where do I where do I start ? \" professor a: w Well , th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there , professor d: OK . One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . professor a: So \" action item \" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . professor a: the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying \" here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? \" grad g: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . professor a: Well grad g: But , I think it would give professor a: That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , grad g:   So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . phd e: But th there is this ,  There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think \" oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? \" And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you professor a:   phd e: And that 's kind of what this kind of , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . phd e: Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . So ,  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur . phd e: But  , it 's difficult to sort of say \" and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? \" Those aren't the kind of things that come up . postdoc h: I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , \" we discussed types of na data collection \" . If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it even if you don't have a direct route to that . postdoc h: I think that grad g: That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . phd b: No , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker grad g: But they phd b: And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , and they can use it for their research .  , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , grad g:   But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , professor d:   Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it . grad g: And so the question is \" is there such a person ? \" And I think right now , the answer is \" no \" . professor a: Well professor d: I 've b been thinking grad g: We 'll just have to see . professor d: I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the  , th this , e  I think that the now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , is actually a reasonable , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at . It 's it 's not ideal , but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . So I was I was just thinking about , suppose we wanted to get w We have this collection of meeting . So now we have five hours of meetings and , you ask me , \" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? \"  , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go \" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , I remember that , what was the part that \" And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , professor d:   professor a:  phd b: So how does the summary get generated ? professor a: Well , i i ? phd b: I 'm not against the idea of a summary , grad g: By hand . phd b: but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it professor a: Or , d o phd b: and how because the summary will drive the queries . professor a: What I I think , you know , in most meetings , phd b: So professor a: this one being different , but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  , you can just make it be on a laptop , phd b:   professor a: so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . postdoc h: I I I think that , there 's we 're using \" summary \" in two different ways . postdoc h: And what I originally thought was , if you asked someone \" what was the meeting about ? \" phd b: OK . postdoc h: And then they would say \" well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about \" And then you 'd have , like I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that professor a:   postdoc h: Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , with mult See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . And , you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , professor d:   professor d: A postdoc h: So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , professor a: OK . postdoc h: no longer than two minutes , professor d: Adam , you can postdoc h: from multiple people . professor d: but but , my impression was that , pretty much , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w  , with a laptop grad g: Never . Does anyone ? phd b: Dan ? professor d: I grad g: Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , phd e: Yeah . Most of the meetings we have are four or five people grad g: That 's true are four or five people . professor d: and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . professor a: So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . grad g: The IRAM meeting , they they take notes every professor d: Do they ? grad g: There 's  a person with a laptop at each meeting . phd b: I don't know how , but for instance , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . phd e: We sh we should grad g: I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , postdoc h: I agree . phd e: f u I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera grad g: Yeah , different phd b: y phd e: just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . grad g: But don't you think that 's Don't you think that But postdoc h: I agree .  , I I just think  , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . phd e: Not not as part of the not as a part of the data that you have to recover . phd e: Just just in terms of phd b: We should just Like archiving it or storing it . postdoc h: It 's i because discourse is about things , phd b: Because someone postdoc h: and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . phd b: someone later might be able to take these and say \" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there phd e: So phd b: and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and \" and just postdoc h: Yes . professor d: Li postdoc h: Like you said , three snapshots professor d: L L L postdoc h: and professor d: Liz , you postdoc h: Just to archive . professor d: u  , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , subcommittee meeting or whatever phd e: Actually professor d: on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the ,  that workshop we were at that , Mark Liberman was was having . They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect professor d:   phd b: And professor d: I think you  , that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing . professor d: And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . professor d: So ,  grad g: But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . So we 're gonna So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us . phd b: I think even doing something very crude professor d: But having phd b: Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . phd b: And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . So if you can find some really , you know , low , perplexity , grad g: Low fidelity . And if it 's simple as  , as simple as just the digital phd b: Otherwise you 'd you lose it . professor d: Well , minimally , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so ,  grad g: Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier professor d: Yeah . grad g: But phd b: Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time professor d:   phd b: and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room . So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded . grad g: So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say \" I won't participate \" . phd b: Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head grad g:  phd b: and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting talking . phd b: That would be an interes Bu postdoc h: Well professor d: Great idea . But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards , phd b: Yeah . postdoc h: sp spatial organization And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , this is grad g: But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work . postdoc h: We can talk about the grad g: To set it up and then anonymize it ? postdoc h: It 's just one snapshot . phd b: No , it wa n not ,  professor a: No , no , no , no . Maybe we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it , phd f: Did they store it digitally , or ? postdoc h: but phd b:   I think they just phd f: or just put it on videotape ? phd b: I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Well , I think for  , for our purposes we probably will d phd b: I 'm not sure . professor d: we we might try that some and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think . postdoc h: Th The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And phd b: I 'm just The community If LDC collects this data u  , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there . phd b: And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , easier made easier if you had the video . professor d: I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . professor d: As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , and and will include all that . professor d: professor a: e professor d: I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , subsets of that . Like for a meeting like this , at least , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , phd b: Of the board . phd b: Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board . professor d: a and know the position of the people phd b: That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . phd b: otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .  , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . grad g: except in postdoc h: s grad g: er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost .  , I just think that the grad g: The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . postdoc h: Well professor a: What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , is in the record . postdoc h: Well professor a: Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  , we  , we don't need to require it . professor a: so so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . professor d: So So , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody from from today ? OK . professor d: So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . professor d: And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries and are we gonna do anything about that . professor a: So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? professor d: Yeah . professor a: So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna n I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . professor d: I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . professor d: So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . professor d: So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero , professor a: Nothing . professor d: and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou professor a: OK . phd b: I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . grad g: And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well . So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . I think it it it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . grad g: but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . professor d: I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another . That if if people have something in front of them phd b: I 'd be sort of cool . So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? grad g: Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . professor d: So who who does this summarization ? postdoc h: Yeah , I 'm thinking that grad g: People in the meeting . grad g: You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go , postdoc h:  - huh . phd e: People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . phd b: Well , then you should try them a few weeks later postdoc h: How fascinating . phd b: and They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain grad g: And see score them ? phd e: That 's right . phd b: and wasn't phd e: If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . professor a: But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , professor d: Ru grad g: I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . professor a: because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . grad g: Maybe e Is email easier ? postdoc h: Well , I think if grad g: I when you first said do do it , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up postdoc h:   postdoc h: Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . But , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay . professor a: But , you know , if you get even one postdoc h: w professor d: Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , postdoc h: I would s Yeah . professor d: that that y that you can't certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . postdoc h: And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be  , phd e: Yeah . postdoc h: Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed , phd e: Right . postdoc h: just phd f: So I have a question about queries , grad g: God , that 's bugging me . phd f: which is , grad g: Can we turn that light off ? postdoc h: You turn phd f:  grad g: If can we turn that just that that let professor d: The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . grad g: Yeah , there 's a phd b: Oh , it is it is like OK . professor a: That and y Too much caffeine and really tired , grad g: Too much caffeine . phd f: the question I had about queries was , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are are we gonna try and o grad g: We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? phd f: Yeah . phd f: so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?  , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , professor d: Mmm . phd f: n phd b: Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? professor d: Yeah . phd b: They 're the expert phd e: Mari ? professor a: Yeah ? phd e: Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ? professor a: what 's our schedule ? professor d: Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . professor a: Let 's see , you and I need dis  , no , we did the Liz talk . professor a: We need to finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So , grad g: And what ? professor a:  professor d: I 'm at your disposal . professor a: what what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should professor d: I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? grad g: At least . professor a: So , I think phd b: It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free professor d: Well , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . professor d: And professor a: e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't phd e: OK , five - thirty . grad g: Well , in answer to \" is it Landay 's problem ? \" , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . professor d: Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I I actually think that that , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .  , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and ,  phd b: But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . phd f: Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . phd f: Right ? Of how to how to generate queries from a phd b: How to do this from the summary . phd b: So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . phd b: and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or or a deeper Yeah . phd b: You postdoc h: I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be \" what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? \" Becau - in terms of like informativeness , phd b: That 's a good one . postdoc h: it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . professor a: But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . postdoc h: Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . postdoc h: So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary . But with the \" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? \"  , so the fact that , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting phd b: Going to see the kids . So , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings professor a:   professor c: Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? grad g: As many are willing to do it . Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? professor c: and then Yeah . phd e: So grad g: Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done  , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . professor a: But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , grad g: Mmm . postdoc h: And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the some some of the little things that would be hidden . professor d: Boy , I I don't know how we get at this postdoc h: That would be interesting . professor c: Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something grad g: Or want to get up and leave . professor c: and then you go around the room and they say \" yeah , me too , I agree . professor c: So phd e: On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? professor d: Well phd e: They might say \" oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else \" . grad g: Well , you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll  , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say .  , It seemed The kind of , interest that I had in this thing initially was , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , professor a:   So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else professor a: Right . professor d: in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now You weren't interested Say I I said \" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person \" . professor d: But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm \" well what is what was that part that that that , Mari was saying ? \" grad g: Yeah , like Jim Bass says \" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf \" professor a:  professor d: Yeah . professor d: And then I 'm trying to fi  , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . professor a: Well , I That 's hard to generate professor d: So , I don't I don't know . phd f: Do we professor a: and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times  , make you know , think to myself \" this is interesting , professor d:   professor a: So , things that I think are interesting , I would be , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . That that might get at some of what I was I was concerned about , being interested in something later that w  , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up . grad g: But But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . grad g: Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it , professor d: Yeah . phd f: The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? professor d:   But postdoc h: Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying \" important \" and we 're saying \" interesting \" . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that  , postdoc h:   professor d: W phd f: does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? professor d: Well , irreversible . phd f: That 's that 's professor d: I I  , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and ,  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . If you know , if  , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that . postdoc h: I will say that that I I chose \" interesting \" because I think it includes also \" important \" in some cases . postdoc h: Well , and and also i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate . You know , I think inter \" interesting \" is is non - threatening in professor a: OK - OK . professor a: In the interest of , grad g: Importance ? postdoc h: Yeah . professor a: No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , and also moving on to action items and other things , let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , that we at least decided on . CrossPads we were going to try , if Landay can get the ,  get them to to you guys , and see if they 're interesting . professor a: getting just , digital pictures a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .  , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , postdoc h: k professor a: and that way you 'll get more variety . \" And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . professor a: OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? That well , that we want to do ? postdoc h:   grad g: Yeah , that 's like n I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then . postdoc h: And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . phd e: there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . phd e: And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . grad g: Give them a reward , a dollar a query ? phd e: Yeah , really . So professor d: Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then  , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to postdoc h: Yeah .  , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? grad g: Well , we 're gonna phd b: So you need to have some sort of if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha phd e:  . phd b: In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . phd b: It But it may well grad g: But professor d: Because  , b because it depends on , what our goal is . grad g: Really ? professor d: If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . professor d: And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , phd e: Yeah . grad g: Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings . phd e: Well just imagine if professor d: But but just phd e: Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , professor d: Yeah . w Just \" what would you like to know ? \" phd e: but grad g: Yep . postdoc h: I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like \" action item \" , professor a: OK . postdoc h: Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , phd b: Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you . phd b: So , in general , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to do this . Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , \" other than your action item \" , you know , whatever . phd e: Well postdoc h: But but the action item would be a way to get , maybe an additional query . Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ professor a: Well , we 're piloting . professor a: or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav professor d: We we had  , phd e: Yeah . professor d: somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , from the description things ? professor a: I got Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . professor d: And , you know , there 's obviously detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , requirements . professor a: people are supposed to send me U R for their for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . We professor a:  ? phd e: we need to look at our web page professor a: And and you also need to look at your web page phd e: and make one that 's that 's p professor a: and clean it up by mid - July . And so ,  professor a: How about if I just c  , Right now all I want I personally only want text data . I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . professor d: Wh postdoc h: You could email to both of us , just  , if you wanted to . postdoc h: I don't think either of us would mind recei professor a: OK . postdoc h: but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the professor a: And your email is ? professor d: i postdoc h: Edwards at ICSI . professor a: And then professor d: In in our phone call , before , we we ,  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , And ,  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service , that will grad g: Oh , is this IBM ? professor d: Yeah . postdoc h: Yeah , using foot pedals professor d: Yeah , foot foot pedals postdoc h: and professor d: and grad g: so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? professor d: See , that 's a good question . professor d: probably about like you did , grad g: Mix ? professor d: and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well . And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll they 'll ,  they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . professor d: We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff grad g: So we 'll give them all sixteen channels professor d: and grad g: and they 'll do whatever they want with it . phd b: But you also should probably give them the mixed You know , equal sound - level professor d: Yeah . professor d: It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . phd f: But w phd b: I phd f: It 's not professor a: Right . phd b: You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did . I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , the on - line , data that Adam set up , The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up postdoc h: Good . grad g: And then p possibly postdoc h: I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . grad g: Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . We were gonna grad g: Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . professor a: That 's postdoc h: Well ,  professor a: W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work phd e: Well  , yeah . So , what n important thing professor a: but Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , postdoc h: Well , it c phd e: Right . professor d: So a key thing will be that you we tell you postdoc h: Great . phd f: and \" professor d: We also had the ,  that we were s  , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number professor a: Oh , yeah . professor d: and we 're all gonna we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , depending on how you define it , users . professor c: Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users . Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , professor a: Yeah . Or , like if you have a professor c: who know that you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . professor a: Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you , professor c: So . e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . professor d: My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it grad g: He would never use it . So I have the professor d: We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , w e e e they 're you know , they 're p m If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , major communications between Dan and UW folks phd e: Yeah .  , professor a: I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August . professor d: as to phd e: we should talk about it , but postdoc h: Mmm . professor a: So , you know , if professor d: But we have it it 's it 's pretty We don't know .  , he he s  , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust professor a: We don't know . professor d: and and so we don't know , professor a: i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , professor d: i e professor a: but a at least it 's worth trying .  , and I will email these notes  , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . professor d: and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have grad g:   professor a: Oh ! professor d: some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . phd e: Yeah , that was  , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . But it 's p it might be phd e: so professor a: But but that 's actually what I wanna do . grad g: Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . If I don't get something grad g: Who ? Landay or Jason ? professor a: Landay . professor a: you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers or I could I could use ,  I could use your web pages . You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor professor d: Yeah , why search for them ? professor a: Yeah ! professor d: They 're we know where they are . professor d: There 's there 's some , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On on meeting recording , grad g: Yep . professor a: So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox , professor d: and phd b: And there 's You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , professor d: And Xerox . phd b: smart rooms , grad g: the \" Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand \" is a good one . J There 's th That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , professor a:   phd b: because of all these classroom grad g: Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of . postdoc h: Can I ask , one thing ? It relates to data data collection and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  , so , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , are lessened . But I wonder if  , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , u w we would c  , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever . postdoc h: Now , you know , it 's true , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . phd f: Adam ! postdoc h: But , i i  , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? professor d:  . phd e: turn off professor a: I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , postdoc h: OK . Just want to be sure there 's enough data to professor a: phd b: They 're still gonna overlap , postdoc h: OK , good . phd b: but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . professor d: Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . postdoc h: because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . postdoc h: Not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired . But if if that 's sufficient data I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people postdoc h: Time . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . professor a: Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . Well , I just as as as a contributary eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know you know , \" wait till each person is finished before you say something \" . professor a: Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , unintrusive as possi postdoc h:   I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u  , you know , as much data as we can . Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ? phd b:   professor d: What phd b: And there was a big division , professor d: What what do they phd b: so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . phd b: So there 's lots of recordings that They 're not close - talk mike , professor d: Yeah . phd b: but And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings .  , and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , professor d:   Is that is that going to be publicly available , phd b: As far as I know , they h have not . grad g: It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? phd b: I 'm not sure .  , if people were interested they could talk to them , but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved . grad g: Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field , phd b: I think you need to talk to Waibel and grad g: intelligent - room sorts of things . phd b: But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . Well , once we send out postdoc h: Yeah , I think professor d: we still haven't sent out the first note saying \" hey , this list exists \" . But but , once we do that professor a: Is that an action item ? professor d: Yeah . We should at least check that everybody here ? grad g: I think everyone here is on the list . grad g: I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me . grad g: You are on it , aren't you ? postdoc h: Yeah , I am . So \" found data \" , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ? phd b: What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect , postdoc h: It sounds like such a t phd b: and especially good postdoc h: Yeah , OK . It 's things occur without any You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . Of course it 's not \" found \" in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . phd b: But what he means is that You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , postdoc h: That 's interesting . phd e: We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? professor a: Oh . phd b: Rrrh ! grad g: Now , I was already thinking about it , so professor d: Oh ! Good man . phd b: I grad g: So , I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that . postdoc h: Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , I I found this discussion very , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought was worthwhile . grad g: Did you take pictures of the boards ? phd e: Not that I postdoc h: Yeah .  , I will take pictures of them , but postdoc h: That 's a good point . phd f: I 'm gonna pass because I can't  , of the Jane took my answer . But I will say  , I will actually  , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , in this project . professor d: Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . phd e: How are we gonna find that in the data ? grad g: Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time phd e: Oh , yeah . grad g: Yeah , I think phd f: Well , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . phd e: How happy were they ? professor d: I 'd probably search for something like that . postdoc h:  h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ? professor d: Now these we turn off "

        "Summary": "The remote design was praised by the marketing team for its user-friendly layout, allowing users to easily reach all buttons with one thumb, regardless of hand size. The prominent placement of the on-off button and attractive colors were also noted as positive features. To cater to both left- and right-handed individuals, mute buttons were positioned on either side. For international appeal, channel buttons would be labeled with numbers while the rest would feature easily recognizable symbols. Marketing also suggested incorporating a humorous element into the shell design, playing on the concept of a rapid snail. The user interface and industrial designers agreed on this idea. The remote's unique selling points would include voice recognition, a feature not commonly found in remotes within the same price range, and its adorable appearance, with the snail image serving as a visual attraction. However, practicality would not be a standout feature, as it was assumed that all competitors would offer this.",

Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it "

        "Summary": "The team discussed the size of the remote control, with Marketing suggesting that the TV itself could have a user-friendly remote control system using different technology. However, the Project Manager believed that this idea would not appeal to men and Marketing eventually gave up on it. The group also debated whether installing a new remote would be seen as a technological innovation, with Marketing recommending voice recognition technology due to its fashionable and trendy appeal. The Marketing team emphasized the importance of innovation, considering the use of fruit and vegetable logos and primary colors on the remote control. They also noted that younger people were more interested in features like LCD screens and speech recognition, while older people were willing to spend more money on larger remote controls. Marketing highlighted the volume and channel buttons as the most important and should be easily accessible.",

What are your experiences ? user interface:  well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And  I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED   a LED on the corner of the of the remote . And that if you push the button the LED  gives a light , and  and you see that it's working .  project manager: So and do they always have that ? user interface: Yeah , but No no no . marketing:  at home we have a T_V_ , a video  recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . But  i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? industrial designer: The weight . industrial designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some  some sort of bleep . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah I think it  from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice .

        "Article": "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Summary": "The impact of the Brexit deal on collaborations is still uncertain, particularly in relation to playing a role in Horizon Europe. Maintaining quality, impact, and growth in capacity is crucial for Wales. Dr. David Blaney believes that these efforts have already yielded positive results, such as increased research funding and a stronger presence in the international research market. However, the main challenge lies in securing sufficient funding. While the government recently allocated an additional \u00a36.6 million for research, this is not sustainable or adequate. The Welsh government has also expressed its vision for research and innovation, emphasizing the need for more investment in the Welsh research base to enhance competitiveness in accessing funding at a UK level.",

So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you? dr david blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between\u2014. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important\u2014delivery of that is going to be really important\u2014and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well. angela burns am: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves\u00a0looking like at present? dr david blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend. There's a difference between the distributable reserves\u2014I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have. angela burns am: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students\u2014it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before. bethan owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have. bethan owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that. angela burns am: So, overall, you're painting a picture of a sector that's under a significant degree of financial stress, and this is obviously using your key financial indicators. Do you monitor each and every university, or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is? bethan owen: We monitor, we receive forecasts, five-year forecasts, and we meet frequently with all our universities now. It varies, depending on the risks of the universities, as to how frequently we meet, but we're actually meeting with every university because even the forecast that we received last July, the changes, even in the 12-month period, are significant enough for us to need a better understanding of what the latest position is. Although it had a turnover and income of \u00a31.5 billion, which had increased, nonetheless it had a small deficit of 0.4 per cent of income in 2017-18, which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent, but notably, again, the sector in England were looking at surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the same period. The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that, for 2018-19, we should have a sector that's roughly in a break-even position, but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July, where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs, and there have been significant changes in pension costs, both for the teachers' pension scheme\u00a0and the universities' superannuation scheme as well, and those will be significant costs\u00a0that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income, certainly their fee income, is not increasing, and that is the challenge. angela burns am: Are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years? dr david blaney: I don't think so. As I said earlier on, we're not seeing a crisis, we're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage. At the moment, our sense is they are managing them, so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that, insofar as we can see it, we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they're facing, and are actually engaging those challenges properly, and we are seeing that at the moment. So I think what we will see if the pressure continues unabated is more costs being taken out, so more jobs being lost, more capacity being lost, but that's not the same as falling over. There is always the possibility of structural change within the sector, and that might be one of the solutions that institutions think about, but it's not a policy position, and it's not always a good short-term response to crisis anyway, actually. But I think, as I say, we're in a managed situation, but the challenges are quite acute. angela burns am: When you talk about structural change, are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close? I bring this up because I'm the Assembly Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and I have had multiple representations from students, and their parents, who are about to go to Lampeter and who've been told that courses are being restructured, there's a massive staff loss, and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained. So I am trying to drill down a little bit, because I think it's only fair for the students to know what they're up against, and also it's a bit like in the great depression\u2014you can start a run on something, can't you? Because if enough people believe it, then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university, really top-quality in medieval literature, in archaeology. And I'm just talking about one, but I know there are problems in other universities around Wales, so I just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as HEFCW might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes. So, if we look at the debate that happened in the Senedd last week, from my reading of the transcript, it was actually quite a balanced debate where pretty much every contributor made reference to the contribution that higher education is making. There was reference to the national student survey scores, and in many ways Wales is the best place in the UK to come and be a student, because you are looked after properly in Wales. But there was also a perfectly legitimate exploration of whether or not there's a crisis, and if you look at the way in which that was represented in the media, the crisis bit stuck and the rest of it didn't. At the point where the sector is trying very hard to recruit students, it's really quite unhelpful that you get that sort of representation. So we do need to make sure, I think, all of us, that we try to avoid a situation where there can be media amplification of a problem that's not actually as acute as the media are portraying it, and that is very harsh. I'm not being critical of the political process here, but it has ripples and we do need to be careful that we don't start a run on this. In terms of the specifics at Lampeter, we understand that there are no plans to close any of the departments, and there certainly will not be plans to pull the rug out from under continuing students. So there's an absolute obligation on them to meet their commitments, and that's a contractual obligation anyway, so it's a legal obligation. But we also have a quality machinery that we operate where we would expect institutions to be able to demonstrate that they've put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that students can finish their programmes of study. So they're not going to be recruiting students to programmes that they're not planning to continue\u2014they just are not going to do that. And if you think about it in a market context, it would be suicidal for a university to treat their students like that. angela burns am: But I have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in Trinity Saint David's financial plans. dr david blaney: Yes, I understand that, so let\u2019s come back to the material uncertainty. What I'm hoping to try and express is that we have absolute confidence that the institutions will not do the dirty on their students. They will look after their students and if they're recruiting to programmes, they are recruiting to programmes that they are planning to run, and run through to completion. And the expectations that we place on them in terms of our quality assurance machinery is precisely that\u2014when they are engaged in portfolio change, they have to look after the interest of the students that they currently have. In terms of our oversight and monitoring, our primary consideration, again, is the interest of the students. They are the people who have, in many ways, least influence over what happens in terms of the way an institution is managed. Although, they do have a voice and, actually, the arrangements for the student voice in Wales are, again, better than elsewhere in the UK. But, nonetheless, we do not wish to see students becoming innocent victims of difficulties of management and financing. Our institutional risk review process is fundamentally designed to make sure that institutions are grappling with their problems before they become a crisis. So, we have machinery, which has 70/80 different factors and hundreds of questions that we ask twice a year, to interrogate the performance of the institutions and to make sure that we are seeing them managing the issues that they're facing. So, it's not the challenges you face, it's the way you face your challenges\u2014it's a clich\u00e9\u2014and, at the moment, they are managing them, but if we were in any way concerned that they weren't, the people who are most at risk in that context are the students and we will be intervening to make sure that they were cited, and we do intervene when we have to. angela burns am: Well, following on from what you said, I've just got two really specific technical questions, then, to ask, because you said that you look across the whole scope to make sure that they are meeting all of their correct liquidity ratios and so on. So, considering how much is invested in their estates, are you happy that each university's estates strategy and its financing is prudent and has appropriate governing-body oversight in place? dr david blaney: Yes, so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution, so there is proper governance oversight. And in all of those instances, there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates. So, the machinery is in place\u2014 angela burns am: Because it's the big thing that drives most of university borrowing, isn't it? dr david blaney: Indeed, it is. angela burns am: So, if our universities are on a sticky wicket, we just need to know that the borrowing that they're undertaking is absolutely prudently assessed and is appropriate. So, as long as you're content, if I can hear you say that\u2014[Laughter.] dr david blaney: Okay. We're content on two fronts: one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that, but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing, they have to get our consent as well. And what we don't do is second-guess everything, but what we do do is make sure that the governing body, or its relevant committees, have been asking the right questions. bethan owen: Can I just add to that, then? angela burns am: Yes, of course. bethan owen: In asking for the forecasts, we have reinforced this year the importance of universities looking at different scenarios. So, to be looking at the demographic and maybe in the past, where there's potentially been growth in the system and universities have built that into their forecast, we have explicitly asked this year that we are provided\u2014not just the governing body\u2014with the scenario where there is no growth in the income. That's not the core forecast, but a scenario, so that it's quite clear how reliant the forecasts are on that growth, and if that growth doesn't come through, what the contingency plans are for ensuring that all the cost commitments can be met. And we should probably just differentiate between\u2014we have a role before borrowings are entered into, but all the best forecasts in the world can never quite predict, certainly what's happened in the last two years, probably, in universities. So, there are significant borrowings that are now committed to and the key measures we are looking at are universities' capacity to meet their covenants and their repayments under those borrowings, because that's essential for maintaining their liquidity. angela burns am: Which actually, neatly, thank you, brings me to my last question, which is: have any universities broken those loan covenants or been close to breaking them, unable to pay their borrowings as and when they fall due? bethan owen: There was a significant change in accounting standards in 2015, financial reporting standard 102, so most universities had to renegotiate their covenants, but it was because the accounts were looking very different. The accounting standards brought about changes in how income was recognised and how some service concession arrangements, largely student accommodation arrangements, and pension costs, significantly, were recognised in the accounts. So, most universities have had to renegotiate covenants, but we're not aware of any who've had to renegotiate due to covenant breaches, other than one which the University of Wales Trinity Saint David disclosed in their financial statements\u2014that they did need to renegotiate their financing arrangements, which they have done earlier this year, and they have now negotiated new covenants. It's a core part of financial management in universities now that you manage your relationship with your lender as well as with us. Breaching covenants in themselves is different to doing that with your lender being unaware and the factors being within your control. So, again, from that perspective, we have the covenants built into our forecasts, we require the forecasts to show how the university are planning to be within their covenants. The nature of those covenants vary, but most of them require a measure of cash flow, a ratio between the cash generated and the cost of debt, so there is close monitoring that is required because of the borrowing in the system, as well as our ongoing monitoring as well. Just before we move on to Hefin David, can I just ask you what your view, then, is on the statement included by auditors in the accounts of Trinity Saint David that there is material uncertainty? bethan owen: Yes, I'll pick up on that. The material uncertainty largely relates\u2014there is a note in the accounts that explains the factors that are being taken into account, but it largely relates to some significant cash receipts that have been subject to timing delays and the fact that the timing of these is essentially outside the control of the institution. The main delay relates to the receipt of funding for the Egin project, which was due to be received from the Swansea city deal. That funding has been delayed, but the sums due to the university are still due to the university\u2014it's the issue of the timing of those receipts that is causing a cash pressure. Just in terms of cash flows, all universities have to ensure that they are maintaining enough cash in their system to meet their payments as they fall due. Most of their costs are incurred on a monthly basis, staff costs in particular, but the income flows into universities are now less regular. In days gone by, that funding would largely flow from us and that would also come on a monthly basis. A quarter of that money comes in in October, a quarter in February, and the majority of it, half of it, doesn't come into the university in cash until May. So, that's quite a different cash management scenario for universities to manage; it requires holding cash balances to do it. Just before I bring Hefin in, we're going to need to have a bit of agility, as Dai Lloyd would call it, in our questioning and our answers if we're going to cover the ground that we need to cover. hefin david am: How can we be assured that governance arrangements across the eight institutions are sufficiently rigorous but also consistent? dr david blaney: So, the first point to make, of course, is that universities are autonomous, as you know\u2014 hefin david am: I've just written 'independent and autonomous'. The university governing body obviously is an important part of the machinery, particularly in terms of generating constructive challenge for the executive within universities. The governing bodies all are expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the guidance produced by the Committee of University Chairs, the CUC guide, which identifies good practice. Just in terms of governing bodies, it's also important that governing bodies engage in a process of continual refreshing, because that gives you a greater variety of perspectives, which is important. But it\u2019s also important they have people who understand the higher education business as well as from other contexts. But I think our view would be that when you get an increase in the contextual pressures that we\u2019ve been discussing already this morning, the role of the governing body actually becomes even more significant. So, we have encouraged the sector, both the chairmen of the university councils, but also the vice-chancellors, to engage in a process of an independent review of governance in Wales. And it hasn\u2019t been hard for us to encourage that\u2014they have been keen to take this opportunity to take stock. The Welsh higher education system is part of a UK system\u2014they don\u2019t want to be a million miles away from the rest of the UK in terms of expectations, but there is scope in Wales, given the scale of the sector, to actually construct something that is more challenging, I think, in terms of expectations, than might be the common denominator across the UK, and maybe some more exemplification. It\u2019s going to be quite hard to do this, but I\u2019m very keen that we engage\u2014and the sector are up for this\u2014in governance culture, because, actually, you can do process checks and you\u2019ll have the right structure of committees and have the right sort of papers going, but, in the end, it\u2019s the dynamic within that room and who\u2019s asking which questions and how well informed they are, and whether it's an open culture or is it a defensive culture\u2014these are really what influences the quality of decision making. hefin david am: And how different are those cultures across institutions? dr david blaney: I think it\u2019s very hard to say. Typically, that\u2019s at a point where there are sufficient difficulties going on that we feel that we need to\u2014 hefin david am: Do you have the option to observe at any point? dr david blaney: We can't insist, I don't think. But in the main, actually, our presence would change the dynamic of that anyway, so I'm not sure that's necessarily helpful. But we are keen to see what we can achieve with the sector in addressing these issues of what constitutes constructive challenge. Is your aim to see consistency in the same approaches, then? dr david blaney: I think we\u2019d like to see a consistent minimum set of expectations. In the end, it\u2019s about personalities, it\u2019s about people\u2019s background and it\u2019s about their knowledge. And we have a role to play in this as well, so we have a toolkit that we produce for governors, which, essentially, is a set of information that locates their university in the context of the UK, across a number of factors. So, if they had been told something that is not perhaps as true as it might be by the executive, they can see that in the data. Whether that toolkit needs a refresh\u2014I\u2019m sure it probably does, it\u2019s been there for a while now\u2014. So, part of that is what information we can provide to help governing bodies be properly informed as well. This is quite distant from Government\u2014unlike other institutions, where you can prescribe some of these approaches. dr david blaney: Yes, and in the end I don't think there's any pushback from the sector in terms of wanting to operate in accordance with best practice. hefin david am: So, what about risk appetite? Do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite? dr david blaney: I don't think so, and this manifests itself in two ways. So, we would see this coming through in forecasts, and we would see it coming through in requests for borrowings, predominantly. Our links into institutions are many and various, and we have our formal stuff, but we all have links into institutions that are informal and we\u2014. One of the beauties of the scale of the sector in Wales is we can see the institutions in a way that they can't hope to in England. But we have, in some instances, I think it's fair to say, helped institutions to think again about some of their aspirations. So, where we've seen things and we think, 'That just looks ridiculously optimistic,' we've just asked the questions. We don't say, 'No, you can't do that,' because they are autonomous, they make the decisions, but we try to make sure that they're asking the right questions. hefin david am: So, would you see that governing bodies are falling short in doing that themselves, in that, where they become strategic decisions that require due diligence, are the governing bodies themselves presenting that challenge? Or the fact you've just said that, does that suggest to us that, actually, they are falling short? dr david blaney: I think there's a mixture of things going on. We have a slightly different perspective and we have a perspective that is very intimately informed in terms of how the institution is performing. So, you have a governing body with a range of perspectives, and you will also have people who are very committed and very enthusiastic about the institution, and just occasionally it's helpful to get a slightly external perspective on these things. So, I don't think it's a shortfall as such, but I just think\u2014 hefin david am: The kind of honest broker role, kind of. dr david blaney: The machinery depends on having a body like HEFCW doing some of that role, and the people who lend money to institutions are absolutely clear about that. So, we have relationships with the banks; they come and see us every now and again\u2014typically not to talk about individual clients but just to talk about what we do and how we do it. Interestingly, for example, when Michael Barber got up before Christmas and said there will be no bail-outs of universities, we had banks on the phone to us within a couple of days, wanting just to talk about how it is in Wales and is it still how it used to be. So, it's not really a governance failure; it's just that the machinery includes us. And one of the things, from a distance\u2014, I've been involved in different ways in an institution, and looking at the institutions from a distance. Do you find that the relationships between executive teams and governors is effective, and are they sufficiently robust and challenging as well? Those executive permanent staff and the governors\u2014is there challenge there? dr david blaney: I would say, in the main, yes. Occasionally, we help the governors to ask the right questions, so occasionally that external perspective we've just discussed is helpful in that regard. Actually, there are times when there are tensions between the executive and governing bodies, inevitably\u2014that's not something that's remarkable\u2014and we can feel that as well. hefin david am: And that can become apparent from a public point of view as well\u2014you know, media reports and\u2014. dr david blaney: Yes, sometimes these things can spill, and the governing bodies also include student representation, staff representation, who are typically union reps, and so, you know, there are all sorts of\u2014. I'm not in any way saying that people are indiscreet, but there are all sorts of interests that are sitting around that table that have to be managed within a governance context. And these tensions are not all-out war, but there are sometimes differences of view and they have to be worked through, and that's governance working properly, I think. hefin david am: Okay, which is\u2014some of the work you've suggested will help towards that. hefin david am: And a last question: you've identified one university as high risk, five as medium, and two as low in the short to medium term. You're obviously not going to tell us which, but what I'm interested in is the direction of travel, and whether those that are 'medium'\u2014are they at any point at risk of becoming 'high' in the near future? dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales, and it's about the financial pressures that we've already discussed this morning. And that is why the efforts that the Minister has gone to to secure the Diamond settlement, and, indeed, other bits of money now and again, are so important. So, she's doing what she can, and that's really good, but we always knew that, between the point of the Diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation, there was going to be a valley to cross. So, the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure; there's a demographic dip, and there are the other contextual factors we've discussed. And the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really don't have to take out, because they don't want to reduce capacity, which they'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves. So, they are seeing deficits, which are managed deficits, where they're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in. hefin david am: And, if you're back in a year or two's time, the next few years, are we confident that there won't be more in the high-risk category? You said you don't see collapse, but are we confident there won't be more in the high-risk category? dr david blaney: Well, I think what I would always say about this process is that it doesn't guarantee 100 per cent accuracy. HEFCW is innately cautious as an organisation, so I'm not going to say we're confident, but that doesn't mean to say we're worried either. So, to answer my question: are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not? dr david blaney: We might. bethan owen: And, just to add, I think the key bit of that is maintaining the attractiveness of Welsh universities to students, because a large proportion are coming not from just Wales, but from England and internationally\u2014so, that's a key part\u2014and also that our research portfolio is invested in, and that also brings economic benefits. So, I think those are the two that we are [correction: need to be] able to maintain: the institutions as attractive options for students, and that our research capacity is invested in. sian gwenllian am: Just in the interest of transparency, are you able to tell us which universities are in which categories of risk? dr david blaney: We don't publish that; we publish numbers. hefin david am: They didn't even try to\u2014[Inaudible.] [Laughter.] lynne neagle am: Okay. Can you explain your overall approach to the 2019-20 allocations and what your priority for allocations has been? bethan owen: We publish our funding allocations, and we published the 2019-20 allocations on 4 June. For 2019-20, we're allocating \u00a3149 million, and, as David said, this is the first year that we've been able to start putting funding, additional funding, in from the Diamond recommendations for investment in the sector. So, that means we've been able to increase our recurrent teaching funding by \u00a37 million\u2014not a significant amount, but it's a start. And we have maintained QR, which is our funding for research, quality research, and postgraduate research, at least at the same levels of \u00a376 million, as it's been that in previous years. We've increased part-time funding by \u00a31 million to \u00a326 million, and we've started to increase support for expensive subjects\u2014that's medicine, dentistry and conservatoire provision\u2014and higher cost subjects\u2014those are the sciences and the STEM. So, we made a start on that and increased that support by about \u00a36 million to \u00a320 million in total. And, in addition to that, we have strategic funding that we're maintaining for Reaching Wider projects and the S\u00ear Cymru project. And then, in addition to our recurrent funding, we have had strategic funding in our remit letters for the last two years. So, we're developing programmes for civic mission, community engagement, collaborations between higher education and further education, and, more recently, we had funding at the end of March to start to implement the recommendations of Graeme Reid's report for research investment, and also for developing mental health and well-being. That strategic funding is very welcome, but to be able to build those activities into our core funding, which we hope Diamond will bring, would be more sustainable for institutions. How do your allocations to the 2019-20 academic year support and incentivise collaboration between HE and FE? dr david blaney: So, there are probably two dimensions to this. First of all, we have provided \u00a33.5 million of separate funding specifically targeted to improve and increase collaboration between HE and FE. So, we put out a circular inviting proposals for that, and it was competitive, so we funded what was the best of the proposals, and we constrained it to be available only to pump-prime new activity or to add value to existing activity, but not just to keep things ticking over. We had seven bids submitted from across the three Welsh regions on a whole range of activities, which we probably haven't got time to go into now. I've got a long list here, but, for example, in south-east Wales, the University of South Wales is leading on a bid partnering with Cardiff University, Cardiff Met, with the Open University and all the FE players in the region. We tried to get it within regions, because that's how you get the biggest impact for learners in the area and also for smaller enterprises in terms of innovation work. And then we direct fund a couple of FE institutions for delivery of higher education for historical reasons, and we also have our funding going through to support franchise activity between HE and FE. There are about 5,000 students who are studying HE programmes under franchise in FE colleges in Wales, and our funding method has, historically for some time now, protected that money. So, we try to prevent universities from taking the money out of franchise and onto campus, because we think it's important to try to encourage local provision within particular localities. And, certainly in areas where public transport infrastructure is perhaps not what it might be, for people to move to universities can be quite a disincentive, so\u2014. Then, finally from me, the council's remit letter for the 2019-20 academic year from the Minister does ask you to consider how you'd increase openness and transparency around the use of fee income. So, what are the issues here, and how will you take this forward? bethan owen: The reporting of the income and expenditure is largely provided, probably more so in narrative form in the accounts and the financial statements and annual reports of institutions. A number of institutions also provide graphs and more easily accessible information to understand the income and expenditure of universities. There are examples of good practice across the sector in presenting as simply as possible what the income sources are for universities and how they spend their money. And we're going to be working with the Welsh universities and sector bodies to improve the accessibility of that information for Welsh institutions. More transparent reporting of income and expenditure, and not just fee income, is actually very important for understanding how income cross-flows work in universities. Some reasonably simplistic analyses can assume that all the student fee just covers the direct costs of academic provision, but there's much more to the student experience than that, so there are costs: there are the infrastructure costs, the student support costs, even the community engagement and all the research activities bring benefits to the teaching and fee provision. So, more transparency of all the universities' income sources and expenditure and a better understanding of the income cross-flows and why you can't look at universities in isolation of student provision and research, you have to look at the whole\u2014so, we'll be working with them to improve that information. We're going to go to Hefin David now for some questions on part-time student funding. hefin david am: Part-time student numbers are bucking the trend in Wales, as I understand it, and we are seeing a bigger increase in Wales of part-time numbers than elsewhere in the UK. How is that going to be sustainable within current arrangements? bethan owen: We've allocated \u00a326.5 million in 2019-20\u00a0to support part-time provision, and we have been able in 2019-20 to fund some growth. So, there is growth in that funding to allow those institutions and incentivise those institutions who have recruited more students than last year to continue to do so. That came at an overall additional cost of \u00a31.9 million, and, based on what we're hearing from student support, we're expecting to see that requirement increase. So, it's one of the areas where we'll need to look at how we prioritise Diamond funding. And at the moment, our intention\u2014but subject to knowing the quantum of it\u2014is to continue to support and fund growth in part-time provision. hefin david am: So, is it possible\u2014? With the Welsh Government's policy of developing lifelong learning, is it possible that will be ever spread more thinly? dr david blaney: That is the challenge, and there's a piece of work that we have in our sights to look again at part-time and what it is and what the various drivers are. There's a temptation, I think, at times, to see it solely in terms of skills for an economy, and it is important for reskilling and upskilling, but actually, it's important for other things as well. If we see higher education solely in terms of skilling an economy, we've missed an important part of the contribution that higher education makes. But part-time is really quite difficult, because there's part-time that is about upskilling, part time that's about reskilling, there's part-time for social purposes, there's employer-supported part-time, there's student\u2014. dr david blaney: Well, there is a sense that they are more price sensitive, yes, and so the support regime that the Government is putting in place is important, and that probably has made a difference to the numbers of part-timers entering the system this last year. But I think we need to stake stock of what is important about part-time, what the market will deliver, what the market won't deliver, what we should fund and so on. And there's a complexity around all that, as I've indicated, which we need to do a bit of work on with the sector, with the student body as well, just to take some stock of this over the next year or so. hefin david am: Could we end up seeing significant fee increases for part-time students? dr david blaney: My sense is we won't. The Government wishes us to monitor, so we monitor, and that in itself is not straightforward, actually. There's a limit to how much a fee increase would be acceptable to the part-time market. I don't think we'll see massive fee increases; we might see a bit, but we won't see masses, I don't think. We've got some questions now on funding for research and innovation, and also we'd like to talk a bit about a replacement for European Union funds. If I could turn specifically to research, we know, of course, that both the Diamond and Reid reviews called for QR funding to be maintained in real terms, but the allocation is exactly the same for 2019-20 as it has been for the past nine years. Have you carried out any kind of assessment of the impact of this level of research funding on universities and, indeed, on the Welsh economy? dr david blaney: I'm sorry; I missed the beginning of that because I couldn't hear this headset. I was talking about the Diamond and Reid reviews at the beginning of my question and the fact that they had recommended that QR funding should be maintained in real terms. The reason the sum hasn't increased is because we haven't had enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations we have to other bits of the HE system. Both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid were very clear about the importance of being able to invest in our QR research funding, for a number of reasons. The capacity of the sector to be able to respond to funding opportunities elsewhere in the UK and across the rest of the world is itself determined by the size and the strength of the research base, which is sustained by QR funding. If they go for UK-based competitive research funding, that is typically constructed on the absolute assumption that QR will be part of that mix. So, they tend to fund to 80 per cent of the actual cost of the research, with the expectation that QR will plug the gap. And we know that, although the Welsh research base is extraordinarily productive, and really is punching above its weight in many ways\u2014and I mentioned earlier the impact of the research base in the last research excellence framework\u2014we know that, actually, it could do so much more, if it just had more scale. So, we fully endorse the reports from both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid that QR is important, and it's important also to be able to allow institutions to invest in research areas that emerge over time. It's almost impossible for a body like us, far less the Government, to know where these emerging strengths are going to come from, and QR provides the flexibility for institutions, which is absolutely fundamental to keeping the research base dynamic. sian gwenllian am: Therefore, you do have concerns that this isn't increasing\u2014you have that concern of a lack of increase in the level of investment. But has any particular assessment been made of the impact of not increasing that funding? dr david blaney: So, there is\u2014. Graeme Reid's report produced an assessment of the correlation between QR funding and capacity to generate funding from other sources, and there's a very close correlation\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Has HEFCW done any assessment to look at the effect of underfunding research, to all intents and purposes? dr david blaney: Not directly. sian gwenllian am: Your remit requires you to encourage universities to continue to develop one particular element of research, which is educational research. How does your allocation for 2019-20 contribute to that in terms of pedagogy and educational research specifically? dr david blaney: Bethan, did you want to say something on this? bethan owen: I was just going to add that, when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in Wales, compared with the rest of the UK, it's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in England, so the figures show that we receive less of the money that's available, which is a factor that results from us having less QR as a percentage, so we're in a situation where we get less of that UK funding that's available as well. sian gwenllian am: So, there's a knock-on to that; that's what you're trying to say. But from the point of view of my question on educational research\u2014? dr david blaney: So, we have provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education, which is a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities, specifically looking at educational issues, and we're providing additional funding to that to add value to the Welsh Government's existing evaluation of the progress of pioneer schools in developing the three-to-15 curriculum in Wales. I won't go into the full detail of it now, but it's a five-partner project feeding into this with researchers from Cardiff, Cardiff Met, Trinity Saint David, Aber, Bangor and the University of South Wales. So, it's a collaborative effort, and we have, in the past, also funded WISERD Education, so it's an important research facility and increasingly being used, I'm delighted to say, by Welsh Government in underpinning its own policy thinking. sian gwenllian am: And likewise, in 2019-20, there will be allocations specifically for this. Well, could you provide the remit letter from\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014do that? You have to do everything in the remit letters. dr david blaney: We do what we can to pay due regard to the remit letters, as the wording goes. sian gwenllian am: And then turning to the impact of the loss of funds were we to leave the European Union. Of course, this is going to have a far-reaching impact on future research, and the Reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact. So, what assessment have you made of how allocations will be able to help universities to transition away from EU funding? dr david blaney: So, again, the Reid review has done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of an impact assessment for us. There has been an additional \u00a36.6 million allocated for research very recently by the Government, which we have put out specifically in line with some of the recommendations from Reid. So, that's a start, but that's not sustainable funding, and it's not enough, really, but it is a good and welcome start. Reid was also not just talking about the money, but also talking about the way in which the Welsh research base both represents itself and also engages with UK-wide developments. And in response to that, we have recently issued our own vision for research and innovation, which was developed over a number of months, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations\u2014we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process? bethan owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund\u2014and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid\u2014is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide \u00a315 million back into the sector in innovation funding. sian gwenllian am: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some \u00a37 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too. bethan owen: That \u00a315 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI\u2014and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research\u2014that we need more funding to do the same thing there. dr david blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those. lynne neagle am: Okay, Si\u00e2n? sian gwenllian am: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups? dr david blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now\u2014we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over \u00a328 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer \u00a31,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales? dr david blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July"

        "Summary": "Dr Frank Atherton emphasizes the importance of having a target that is both achievable and challenging. He believes that a target is not only a tool, but also an evaluation to assess progress. However, there is still much work to be done. In terms of investment, Dr Frank Atherton mentions that they currently invest in various areas related to child health, including obesity. The estimated investment needed for their plan is around \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million per year. Additionally, Dr Frank Atherton suggests considering diverting some of the \u00a37 billion spent on health and social care towards prevention initiatives and tackling obesity. The latest data presented by Dr Frank Atherton shows that less than a third of children aged four or five are overweight or obese, but the situation is not improving. The data also reveals that about 12% of children are severely obese. Dr Frank Atherton highlights the importance of having a longitudinal view of children's health over time, which would require significant resources. He also supports the implementation of legislation to create a healthy environment, citing examples of food takeaways. Overall, Dr Frank Atherton's goal is to address the challenges of child health and obesity through targeted strategies and investments.",
        "Article": "We've received apologies for absence from Michelle Brown and Jack Sargeant; there are no substitutions. We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. If I can just start by asking about the fact that 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that it will deliver for children and young people. We have high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults\u2014we know that, and we can't walk away from that because that's translating into demand on health services. But we have to take a focus, a future generation's focus, almost, on the next generation. I don't write off the current generation, we can't afford to do that, but we do need to think about what can we do that would be different for the next generation so that they don't get into the sorts of problems that we're currently seeing with overweight and obesity. We know that the consequences of that for our young people are going to be enormous if we don't do something and something quite soon. We know that overweight children go on to become overweight adults, unfortunately, and that brings all the consequences of multiple disease issues\u2014diabetes is often cited\u2014cancer risk et cetera. So, we have to focus on children, and, in fact, during the consultation, we've been very clear that we need to engage with children and young people as well. Perhaps we'll get into that at some point, Chair, but, yes, I can give you that assurance. What my follow-up question, really, is: can you just tell us what kind of engagement you've had with children and young people to inform the draft strategy? dr frank atherton: Well, Nathan may be able to influence some of the detail, but in broad terms, we have discussed with young people in a number of fora. In fact, I was delighted that we had a young person, Evie Morgan, a schoolgirl from mid Wales, who came to the joint launch on the consultation. She met the Minister there and gave a very good personal account of her views on obesity and overweight. I'm visiting a school, either this week or next week, at Treorchy, to talk with teachers and young people there. nathan cook: I was going to say, we've also had a session with youth ambassadors as well, and what we've actually produced for the consultation is not just the children and young people's version, but also a toolkit in terms of getting schools really engaged and involved in terms of the work that we want them to do to feed into this as well. So, we've already had some really good responses from a lot of youth group and schools already. lynne neagle am: And you've got a structured programme, have you, to roll that out? Okay. We've got some questions now on leadership, and the first questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. The Minister for health said yesterday, in answering a question from me on the Chamber floor, that you gave him advice not to have a target in terms of reducing obesity among children. Could you confirm that that's what your advice was and tell us why you don't think that a target is needed? dr frank atherton: My advice was not that we don't need a target\u2014we may well need a target, and that's one of the issues we need to consult on\u2014but that the target that had been adopted in England and in Scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable, and that if we are to choose a target in Wales, then we need to balance deliverability with challenge. So, there is something about performance management, because I would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they're delivering on this, and I think we can use targets to that. But they are one tool in the box that I would think we could use, and part of the consultation is to ask that question\u2014'If we are to go down a route in Wales of choosing a target, what might that look like?' sian gwenllian am: Okay. dr frank atherton: It's certainly something that we could consider in terms of the final strategy. Well, that is contrary to what I was told yesterday on the floor of the Chamber by the Minister, but there we go. I'm glad to hear that you're not ruling out having a target, because without a target, without something to aim for, how do we know that we're getting there? dr frank atherton: I think your point about evaluation is really important. Whatever we produce at the end of this process\u2014and we're looking to produce a final strategy towards the autumn\u2014we do need to have a strong evaluation. So, some metrics in there, it would seem, would be appropriate, but what those are, what the nature of those are, do we frame them as targets or ambitions\u2014that's the point we need to consult on. If the Government is going to be successful in terms of the aim of reducing childhood obesity, then it needs to fund and support the actions. Have you made an assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan? dr frank atherton: Resourcing will be important. We currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally, and, of course, obesity and overweight in particular. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in Wales. A figure of \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest, but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes. Can we make them more effective? Can we get better value from them? And there may well be a case for new investment, and that's a question, of course, that would need to be discussed with Ministers when we're producing the final strategy. nathan cook: But I think a key consideration as well is we already know there is investment across health boards in some kind of obesity-related services. So, I think what we really need to think about across Wales is how we can drive greater scale, how we can look at current programmes in terms of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well. sian gwenllian am: And does the level of investment depend on what the target is\u2014what the goal is? dr frank atherton: I don't think you can necessarily just link the two. The issue of resourcing is one that's there irrespective of whether we choose to put a target in place. sian gwenllian am: But how would we know that it's being used effectively if there isn't something to aim for? dr frank atherton: Which brings you back to the question about evaluation. sian gwenllian am: Yes, but without a target, how can you properly evaluate? If you don't know what you're trying to do, how can you properly evaluate? Anyway, you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on soft drinks towards some of these efforts to\u2014? dr frank atherton: Well, of course, there are some consequentials that are coming to the Welsh Government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks. That funding, of course, is less than we had anticipated, and that reflects, actually, a success story because industry is reformulating, and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease, which is a good thing. I'm not personally in favour of hypothecation, I think I'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource. And when I think about obesity, I don't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the \u00a37 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general, and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular. Could you give us any kind of figure? dr frank atherton: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? sian gwenllian am: You say that there is less money that's come in through these consequentials from the levy, can you mention some sort of figure? dr frank atherton: The figure that I have in mind is about \u00a356 million that's coming in in terms of revenue over a two-year period. When the sugar levy was first brought in, there was some modelling at UK level about what level of revenue that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. nathan cook: Yes, I was going to say, there was a mid-year report done where the levy has raised \u00a3150 million to date since coming into force in April, and the original forecast was \u00a3520 million a year. So, I think that shows the amount of work that's been done by industry around reformulation. sian gwenllian am: And the consequentials of that? That is the consequential\u2014\u00a3150 million. sian gwenllian am: Yes, so what's the Welsh consequential? lynne neagle am: Fifty-six. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million. So, obviously, you know, we can be more ambitious because there is money in that pot if that money was ring-fenced for this particular scheme. dr frank atherton: Well, the resource is going to be a real issue that we need to address, and I think as Nathan has said, there is funding of various initiatives currently in the system, and we need to look at that and make that as effective as possible. Will there be a need for some additional resource? There may well be, and that's a question that we'll have to look at in terms of the strategy when we develop it and have a discussion with Ministers about the level of resourcing. lynne neagle am: Can I just ask on that before Si\u00e2n moves on? What assessment have you made of how that money is being spent in other UK nations? Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to\u2014? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that? dr frank atherton: I'm not sure I understand your point, Chair, in terms of the link between the consequentials from\u2014. Are you talking about the consequentials from the sugar levy or are you talking about\u2014? lynne neagle am: Yes, because in other nations, it is being used to directly impact on initiatives to tackle obesity, whereas, we've kind of put it here in Wales into the general pot and it's being used to fund a plethora of different things. My preference\u2014it's a personal view\u2014is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. , what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention. lynne neagle am: No, I recognise that, and I think we're talking about additional resource. suzy davies am: I was just wondering whether you thought that there was a useful psychological link on the part of the public between saying, 'Here's a sugar levy', and 'It's going to be used to help children and adults stay healthier.' Going into a pot, it actually makes it quite difficult to explain the purpose of the tax in the first place. So, I take your overall point, but in terms of the people who we're trying to help in all this, actually creating a direct link might be quite helpful. You're putting an emphasis on the whole-system approach in implementing the plan, how are you going to create a system that co-ordinates action and drives change across relevant partners, avoiding a situation where it's everyone's role, but nobody's responsibility? How are you going to avoid that? dr frank atherton: It's a very important question, and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that, around leadership and drive nationally. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down. And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important. But I'd like to see\u2014and I know I'm a public health professional, so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system; but I would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well. So I'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this. So, we'll need some sort of national oversight, absolutely, but we need local ownership and local leadership, too. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister? dr frank atherton: Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as\u2014I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government. janet finch-saunders am: I know my colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives? dr frank atherton: Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: Could I just ask\u2014sorry to interrupt\u2014how up to date is that? dr frank atherton: The last survey was just last year. dr frank atherton: So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows\u2014. It's not getting radically worse\u2014there's always statistical variation in these things\u2014but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way. Does that answer your question? janet finch-saunders am: Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed? dr frank atherton: Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that  in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier. nathan cook: And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful. lynne neagle am: Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data? dr frank atherton: I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years\u2014what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,\u00a0 but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation? dr frank atherton: It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland\u00a0to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got\u2014we need to deploy them all. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that? dr frank atherton: I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. I think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively.\u00a0I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around? dr frank atherton: Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would\u2014it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue. Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity.\u00a0I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pinning that down a little bit? Because this is education, not health, and\u2014. dr frank atherton: Well, look, I've got to confess to you, I'm not an educationist, and so the question on staffing numbers in schools is not one that I have been asked to give a deal of consideration to, and it hasn't really been discussed, I don't believe, in the context of development of the strategy. If there is a specific point around that that the committee would like to make in terms of a response into the consultation, which I presume you'll be making, then we'd be happy to consider that. We have standards and we perhaps need to think about how we tighten those standards and how we\u2014enforce isn't the right word, but how we implement and make sure that those standards are properly implemented, because you're absolutely right to say that habits are developed early in life. That's in the preschool; it's also in the home of course, and then later in the school. So, we do need to look at all of those as settings and are there more things we can do within those settings to drive healthier behaviours\u2014that's exactly why we need the consultation. nathan cook: But I would say, through that scheme as well, we've really got a really good bank of preschools that are actually doing some really great work in this area as well. So, I think the more we can understand the successes that some of those environments are having\u2014you know, how we can roll those out and work across other settings to create that wider impact as well is going to be really important. What I'm thinking about is expectations at that level will be expectations at a slightly older level, which will be contained within the foundation phase. And while you're quite right\u2014obviously, parents have a role in this, or families\u2014there will be, particularly with the introduction of the new curriculum, certain expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children and things. And that's why I asked you about local leadership, because, if it fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the plan at foundation phase, it's going to fail further up the school years as well. I think it might be something that the board might want to consider here, because at some point there'll be an accountability question and we will want to know how 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' fits in with the new plans for the new curriculum, and whether it's merely persuasive and influential or whether it has the weight to place some obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools. So, this connection, I think, is quite an important one, and, if the strategy development board could consider that, I think it would be very helpful, because this doesn't exist in a vacuum. dr frank atherton: Well, I'd certainly be delighted to\u00a0take that back and we can look at it in terms of how we move from the consultation into the final strategy. suzy davies am: Because we will want to know who to ask: 'you're the accountable person\u2014why has something worked, or not worked?' We will need to know that at some point. dr frank atherton: Just building on Nathan's point, some of the schools\u2014I know it's schools rather than the preschools, and I take your point, but some of the schools we've been working with have absolutely brilliant models of good practice and good local leadership. I remember the Minister actually at the launch, and one of the schools was represented there, and they presented\u2014the school came and some of the children came and presented\u2014to the whole audience about the activities that they were undertaking in their school around physical activity and on healthy eating, and it was such a model of good behaviour the question was, 'Well, why not everywhere?', so that probably speaks to your question. lynne neagle am: And have you had any discussions, then, with education officials around things like teacher training and CPD, because you'll be aware the Health and Social Care Committee has made a number of recommendations in this area? It's crucial that we skill up the staff to develop these things in an appropriate way, isn't it? dr frank atherton: Well, we certainly discuss with education colleagues in Welsh Government. There's more we need to do in terms of that, because you're absolutely right: there's something about building the whole of the workforce\u2014education is really important, but elsewhere as well; it's about how do we really make every contact count, you know, that construct. So, everybody who's working in the health and social care system should have a role in this; everybody who works in education, whether it's the old\u2014. Do we still have dinner ladies? Or teachers, you know, they have a role to play in supporting children to be as healthy as they possibly can. And, actually, I see them, Chair, as a really essential part of the public health workforce. Suzy, are you going to do your curriculum one? suzy davies am: Well, I've bound it in together, but that final point you make about teachers being part of the answer to this, they're already under a range of pressures: is it fair to make them accountable for whether this works or not? Or should that local leadership lie somewhere else? I don't expect you to pin down a person today. dr frank atherton: I wouldn't like to blame a teacher or performance manage them on the proportion of their children in their class who are overweight. That would clearly be nonsense, wouldn't it? But they are part of the solution, and so the accountability lies further up the chain, doesn't it? The question I think we would have, and public services boards might well ask, and the local education authorities may well ask, is: how effective is any particular school at driving forwards these healthy behaviours? suzy davies am: Okay, thank you. hefin david am: Is that all right, Chair? lynne neagle am: You've got the floor, Hefin. What would that look like? dr frank atherton: Just in terms of the physical activity, I have to say it's a really important dimension and we need to move further on. We know not enough of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It does have an impact on healthy weight, but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation, in terms of mental health issues, et cetera, you know. nathan cook: I'd just say that one thing we have got in train is, obviously, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales\u2014we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently. So, one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we're already delivering as well. hefin david am: With that in mind, I'm going to confess to you, chief medical officer, I did anything in school I could to avoid physical education lessons. Yet, two weeks ago, I played for the Assembly rugby team\u2014I wanted to get that in. How can we get children more engaged with physical education in ways that\u2014? I felt completely alienated in school. dr frank atherton: Well, you're right, and many people go through that same journey and come to physical activity later in life, and that's great if they do that. The sad reality is that many people don't, and we also know that there are issues around the dropping off, particularly for girls, of physical activity towards the teenage years. , at the heart of it, it's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people. Sometimes that's easier, I sense, for boys than for girls, but we need to tailor things to different audiences. hefin david am: Yes, that's the trick, isn't it? It's about finding out what children enjoy doing. It's not just about elite sports; it's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity. hefin david am: So, do you think, with that in mind, we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education? dr frank atherton: Again, I'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance. And finally, with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools, do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils? dr frank atherton: I don't have a personal view on that. I think it's the quality of the food that kids are getting, whether that comes from home or through school, and whether it's free or whether it's paid for. The question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level. I think that's a\u2014 hefin david am: So, you think that's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet. dr frank atherton: I think it's important that children have access to food, absolutely, if that's your question, but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what's in that food offer. I've been around some amazing schools in my own constituency, where they've got proper canteen facilities for pupils and really, really good produce in the meals. And, to be honest, I've been very surprised and shocked at what I've seen of the quality of the food in the packed lunches. Nobody can really police, and I wouldn't want to see parents being policed over what goes in a packed lunch, so if there is data out there to suggest that there's a larger percentage of parents providing packed lunched that are really not good at all, then there is some merit to be said for what Hefin is\u2014. Would you be willing to carry out any research? dr frank atherton: So, your point about food that's brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a route of guidance and prohibition, but that gets you into the role of nanny in chief and I don't really see that as my role or Government's role, and I don't think it's effective either. Do you remember\u2014? You must have seen on tv\u2014I think it was in Scotland; I don't know if it's happened in Wales\u2014parents pushing the fish and chip packets through the school railings. What I have seen, though, is some really good innovative practice in schools where, for example, they reward children for bringing the healthy options. Schools can give guidance to parents about what would be a healthy lunch and what sort of things might be expected to be seen in the lunch box. So, I've seen some of those approaches that have transformed, actually, the offer of what comes in school boxes. So, my point to the question was: isn't there some merit, perhaps, about all children being equal and eating similar good-quality food in schools? dr frank atherton: Yes. The draft plan commits, doesn't it, to updating the healthy eating in schools regulations\u2014the 2013 regulations? I appreciate this is a consultation, but what is it that needs changing in those regulations at the moment, just to give us a bit of steer? nathan cook: It's mainly on sugar content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is, you know, what we need to be careful of is unintended consequences of changing that, as well, if you see a shift to more kids bringing in school packed lunches as well. So, I think we want to consider the best way of doing that and consider through the consultation how we can go about it. janet finch-saunders am: The 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' plan commits to a review of the clinical obesity pathway. What are the time frames for this review, and what do you think are the basic essentials of a clinical obesity pathway for children and young people? dr frank atherton: We do have a pathway for managing overweight, and that's been in place since about 2010, I believe, and we do need to bring that up to date in terms of current knowledge and experiences. We've challenged Public Health Wales; we've asked Public Health Wales to undertake a review of that pathway, and they are going through that process now. nathan cook: We were asking them to review the pathway before we launch the final strategy in October because, obviously, what we want is for that to inform what that final strategy looks like. dr frank atherton: The second point of your question about what are the essential elements, they are already there; we need to tweak them and we need to make sure that they're properly delivered. But it's a tiered approach, so, having access to information through schools and through communities and into families is part of the first step of that. And then, if children are overweight, it's a question about how they're identified. There are questions about the ability of the public to recognise large children, so there may be an issue there. But when children are running into issues around weight, what kind of interventions can be put in, either through primary care or through communities through health visitors, et cetera? And then of course we do have\u2014and we've started to shine a light on this, haven't we\u2014the very overweight children. I don't think we have enough in the way of targeted support to be able to support those. So, I think there's something about looking at our whole pathway, mapping out what the current evidence now shows us is needed, and then thinking about what is our provision in Wales and what do we need to do to bring that up to the level of the places that are the best. The draft plan recognises the importance of the first 1,000 days, but it doesn't appear to include any new proposals to help parents to enable lifestyle changes. Are you satisfied that the draft plan does enough to address the influence that family and parents have on children's healthy weight behaviours, particularly in the first 1,000 days? dr frank atherton: Well, the first 1,000 days are really critically in shaping lives, as I'm sure you'd agree. We are absolutely open to any other suggestions that the public or this committee have as to what more we can and should do. There are a number of things, the sorts of programmes you've mentioned, that I think could be more effective. We know that children who are breastfed are less likely to suffer from obesity in childhood and, indeed, to go on to be obese adults. If there are other interventions in other areas that we need to take, then we'd be delighted to hear what they are, but those are the ones that have jumped out so far. nathan cook: Can I just say\u2014? One of the proposals we're looking for is, obviously, we know that during pregnancy it's a really critical time when we can actually look to work with mothers. We know from looking at some of the behaviour change that it's actually a really critical point when new mothers really start thinking about their lives, wanting the best for their child and their families. So, what we are thinking about is how we could develop some kind of approaches to that going forward. But we know our Healthy Start scheme is also a good lever for us, just in terms of how we can look to improve that kind of dietary offer at the earliest stage as well. Finally, we know that for some families day-to-day challenges can make it difficult for them to make healthy choices, particularly for those on lower incomes and/or maybe using food banks. Could the Welsh Government take bolder action to better support low-income families to eat healthily? dr frank atherton: Well, you've touched on a really important point about inequalities because overweight and obesity is not evenly distributed across our population. It absolutely is more prevalent in more socioeconomically deprived communities, and that's something that should really concern us all. So, it gets you to questions of availability of fresh food and produce; it gets you to questions of formulation of products and whether value brands are less healthy than more premium brands. So, it cuts across all of those issues that we talked about in terms of settings and in terms of environment earlier. We do need to think in broad terms\u2014broader terms than just obesity, but we do need to think in broad terms\u2014about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets you to really important questions about the minimum wage and income poverty. There's no doubt in my mind\u2014I'm a public health professional\u2014and there's no doubt in my mind that economic success and health success go hand in hand. In terms of what we can do through this particular consultation, there are some things in there about providing better access, but without tackling some of those deeper determinants of health, their impact will necessarily be limited. lynne neagle am: Just finally from me, then, you referred earlier to the importance of making every contact count, but some stakeholders have told the committee that they struggle to do that because of difficulties in availability of people to refer to. Is that a situation that you recognise and what, really, can we do to improve that situation? dr frank atherton: Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. What we're seeing across the NHS is a gradual transformation in primary care so that primary care is no longer about going to see your GP, it's about going to see a practice where you have a range of health professionals. Would I like to see more dietetic support, for example, in that setting? Absolutely I would. I think we need to think in terms of that pathway that we were talking about earlier, about access to that kind of advice and support, which can head off people getting into problems and kids getting into problems with weight issues. So, that question of redesign of the pathway really speaks to, I think, your point about, 'Well, where do people go when they have problems with their weight?' That's true for adults and it's true for children as well. Well, can I thank you both very much for your attendance? It's been a really productive session. Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the committee, because getting some input into the consultation from children's perspectives, this would be one of the routes we would absolutely welcome.

So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? user interface: Yeah , but  Yeah . marketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the  younger people , and they ate  fruit and vegetables , well it has a  a nice colour ,  well compared to food but we didn't  We did not paint any  fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . industrial designer: project manager: So industrial designer: marketing: project manager: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . industrial designer: project manager: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? industrial designer: One . project manager: So , then  then then then then then then Then industrial designer: We're not gonna make it . project manager: Oh , no , we industrial designer: I don't think it's a very special colour . project manager: No , it's  Sorry ? industrial designer: Yellow ?  , is it a special colour ? marketing: For a remote control . So industrial designer: And what if we use only one sort of   just only plastic or only rubber ? project manager: That's one Euro . If industrial designer: If we change the joyst  the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . We industrial designer: And if you say it's just a r  normal colour it's a normal colour , wh project manager: Yellow rubber . industrial designer: Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . But if you lose the joystick , it's still  an advanced chip ? industrial designer: No . marketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . project manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an  regular chip and no L_C_D_ . marketing: If  industrial designer: So , the T_V_s has to  have to be up-to-date . marketing: If we have the n no buttons If we have we have  not a joystick but buttons , we would have  , we have thirteen Euros ? project manager: yes . What's the normal colour ? user interface: industrial designer: Oh , well that's clear . project manager: Now it's industrial designer: marketing: still , he waited at the project manager: Very good . Well What do you think of it ?  marketing: industrial designer: About the project manager: About the project . I I espe I especially  liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and  Yeah , it  It brings up new ideas when you work with  with it . marketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal  normal project without laptops  and without these devices . I think  Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . And maybe is then  the task of the the project manager to also  ask more to the people  less talking "

        "Article": " and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on spectral subtraction and the opinions of the professor and PhD F.",
        "Summary": "The team explored different approaches for spectral subtraction, including both scaling and GGT bins. Each approach had its pros and cons. The professor suggested a simple spectral subtraction followed by a KL transformation. Additionally, he recommended using JRASTRA's technique, which involved adding noise to eliminate noise. The team also discussed VTS techniques. Initially, the professor did not see the advantage of combining the Wiener filter and the subspace, but later realized that a simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform and a Wiener filter, would suffice. The log magnitude spectral subtraction utilized twelve seconds from the past and future to calculate the mean. The use of a short window did not significantly impact the model's performance, which was desirable. The team also removed silence to enhance the model's effectiveness, drawing a parallel to caching utterances. PhD F shared that the preliminary results from spectral subtraction were unsatisfactory, but mean normalization helped reduce noise. However, mean and variance normalization only improved speech, not noise variance.",
        "Article": "phd e: So it 's well , it 's spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , depending on if we put if we square the transfer function or not . phd e: And then with over - estimation of the noise , depending on the ,  the SNR , with smoothing along time , smoothing along frequency . phd e: And , the best result is when we apply this procedure on FFT bins , with a Wiener filter . phd e: So it 's good because it 's difficult when we have to add noise to to to find the right level . It 's the same , idea but it 's working on mel bands , and it 's a spectral subtraction instead of Wiener filter , and there is also a noise addition after , cleaning up the mel bins . professor b: if you look at databases , the , one that has the smallest smaller overall number is actually better on the Finnish and Spanish , but it is , worse on the , Aurora phd e: It 's worse on professor b:  on the , TI - TI - digits , phd e: on the multi - condition in TI - digits . But , when you say u  , unified do you mean , it 's one piece of software now , or ? phd e: So now we are , yeah , setting up the software .  , and we phd a: So what 's what 's happened ? I think I 've missed something . So a week ago maybe you weren't around when when when Hynek and Guenther and I ? phd c: Hynek was here .  And then if I summarize somebody can tell me if I 'm wrong , which will also be possibly helpful . phd e: p - p - p professor b: We ,  we looked at ,  anyway we after coming back from QualComm we had , you know , very strong feedback and , I think it was Hynek and Guenter 's and my opinion also that , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression . professor b: we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were d  , completely different . professor b: And , fundamentally they 're the same sort of thing but the math is a little different so that there 's a a there 's an exponent difference in the index you know , what 's the ideal filtering , and depending on how you construct the problem . professor b: And , I guess it 's sort you know , after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me because  , if you 're dealing with power spectra then how are you gonna choose your error ? And typically you 'll do choose something like a variance . Whereas when you 're when you 're doing the the , looking at it the other way , you 're gonna be dealing with signals phd c:   professor b: and you 're gonna end up looking at power  , noise power that you 're trying to reduce . And so , eh so there should be a difference of you know , conceptually of of , a factor of two in the exponent . professor b: But there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of of , over - subtraction and and and and and so forth , that arguably , you 're c and and and the choice of do you do you operate on the mel bands or do you operate on the FFT beforehand . There 're so many other choices to make that are are almost well , if not independent , certainly in addition to the choice of whether you , do spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , that , @ @ again we sort of felt the gang should just sort of figure out which it is they wanna do and then let 's pick it , go forward with it . And and , we said , take a week , go arm wrestle , you know , grad d: Oh . professor b: And and so they so instead they went to Yosemite and bonded , and and they came out with a single single piece of software . phd a: So so you guys have combined or you 're going to be combining the software ? professor b:  . phd c: Well , the piece of software has , like , plenty of options , phd e: Oh boy . professor b: Well , that 's fine , but the thing is the important thing is that there is a piece of software that you that we all will be using now . phd e: Well , if we want to , like , optimize different parameters of phd c: Parameters . But , still so , there will be a piece of software with , will give this system , the fifty - three point sixty - six , by default and professor b:   phd a: I I I don't have a sense of phd e: It 's just one percent off of the best proposal . professor b: So it so , it 's it it 's not using our full bal bag of tricks , if you will . professor b: And , and it it is , very close in performance to the best thing that was there before .  , but , you know , looking at it another way , maybe more importantly , we didn't have any explicit noise , handling stationary dealing with e e we didn't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise . phd a: So will the neural net operate on the output from either the Wiener filtering or the spectral subtraction ? Or will it operate on the original ? professor b: Well , so so so argu arguably , what we should do  , I gather you have it sounds like you have a few more days of of nailing things down with the software and so on . But and then but , arguably what we should do is , even though the software can do many things , we should for now pick a set of things , th these things I would guess , and not change that . And I think , you know , that our goal should be by next week , when Hynek comes back , to  , really just to have a firm path , for the you know , for the time he 's gone , of of , what things will be attacked . But I would I would I would thought think that what we would wanna do is not futz with this stuff for a while because what 'll happen is we 'll change many other things in the system , phd a:   professor b: and then we 'll probably wanna come back to this and possibly make some other choices . phd a: But just conceptually , where does the neural net go ? Do do you wanna h run it on the output of the spectrally subtracted ? phd e: Mmm . professor b: Well , depending on its size Well , one question is , is it on the , server side or is it on the terminal side ?  , if it 's on the server side , it you probably don't have to worry too much about size . So the issue is is , for instance , could we have a neural net that only looked at the past ? phd a: Right . professor b: what we 've done in  in the past is to use the neural net , to transform , all of the features that we use . This is essentially ,  I guess it 's it 's more or less like a spee a speech enhancement technique here phd a:   professor b: right ? where we 're just kind of creating new if not new speech at least new new FFT 's that that have you know , which could be turned into speech  , that that have some of the noise removed . professor b: after that we still do a mess of other things to to produce a bunch of features . And then the the way that we had it in our proposal - two before , we had the neural net transformed features and we had the untransformed features , which I guess you you actually did linearly transform with the KLT , phd e: Yeah . professor b: but but but  , to orthogonalize them but but they were not , processed through a neural net . And Stephane 's idea with that , as I recall , was that you 'd have one part of the feature vector that was very discriminant and another part that wasn't , phd a:   professor b: which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when , the testing set was quite different than what you 'd trained your discriminant features for .  , y you know , that 's still being debated by the by people in Europe but , no matter how they end up there , it 's not going to be unlimited amounts , phd a: Yeah . And I think those that we last time we agreed that those are the three things that have to get , focused on . phd a: What was the issue with the VAD ? professor b: Well , better ones are good . phd a: And so the w the default , boundaries that they provide are they 're OK , but they 're not all that great ? professor b: I guess they still allow two hundred milliseconds on either side or some ? Is that what the deal is ? phd e:   phd e: And all the speech pauses , which is Sometimes on the SpeechDat - Car you have pauses that are more than one or two seconds . And , yeah , it seems to us that this way of just dropping the beginning and end is not We cou we can do better , I think , phd a:   phd e: because , with this way of dropping the frames they improve over the baseline by fourteen percent and Sunil already showed that with our current VAD we can improve by more than twenty percent . phd e: So , our current VAD is is more than twenty percent , while their is fourteen . And another thing that we did also is that we have all this training data for let 's say , for SpeechDat - Car . And if we just take only the , VAD probabilities computed on the clean signal and apply them on the far - field , test utterances , then results are much better . phd e: So it means that there are stim still phd a: How how much latency does the ,  does our VAD add ? phd e: If if we can have a good VAD , well , it would be great . phd a: Is it significant , phd e: right now it 's , a neural net with nine frames . phd a: or ? phd e: So it 's forty milliseconds plus , the rank ordering , which , should be phd c: Like another ten frames . professor b: So what 's the ? If you ignore  , the VAD is sort of in in parallel , isn't i isn't it , with with the ?  , it isn't additive with the the , LDA and the Wiener filtering , and so forth . phd c: So we  , if so if we if so which is like if we reduce the delay of VA So , the f the final delay 's now ba is f determined by the delay of the VAD , because the LDA doesn't have any delay . So if we re if we reduce the delay of the VAD , it 's like effectively reducing the delay . phd a: How how much , delay was there on the LDA ? phd c: So the LDA and the VAD both had a hundred millisecond delay . So and they were in parallel , so which means you pick either one of them phd a: Mmm . professor b: And there didn't seem to be any , penalty for that ? There didn't seem to be any penalty for making it causal ? phd c: Pardon ? Oh , no . phd c: Or something like that professor b: And he says Wiener filter is is forty milliseconds delay . phd a: What amount of latency are you thinking about when you say that ? professor b:  . professor b: You know , they 're saying ,  one group is saying a hundred and thirty milliseconds and another group is saying two hundred and fifty milliseconds . phd a: Were you thinking of the two - fifty or the one - thirty when you said we should have enough for the neural net ? professor b: Well , it just it when we find that out it might change exactly how we do it , is all . professor b: how much effort do we put into making it causal ?  , I think the neural net will probably do better if it looks at a little bit of the future . And , you know , how how much time should we put into into that ? So it 'd be helpful if we find out from the the standards folks whether , you know , they 're gonna restrict that or not . But I think , you know , at this point our major concern is making the performance better and and , if , something has to take a little longer in latency in order to do it that 's you know , a secondary issue . professor b: But if we get told otherwise then , you know , we may have to c clamp down a bit more . phd c: So , the one one one difference is that was there is like we tried computing the delta and then doing the frame - dropping . phd c: The earlier system was do the frame - dropping and then compute the delta on the professor b:  - huh . So , yeah , what we do is we compute the silence probability , convert it to that binary flag , professor b:  - huh . phd c: and then in the end you c up upsample it to match the final features number of phd e:   phd a: Did that help then ? phd c: It seems to be helping on the well - matched condition . And it actually r reduced a little bit on the high mismatch , so in the final weightage it 's b b better because the well - matched is still weighted more than professor b: So , @ @  , you were doing a lot of changes . Did you happen to notice how much , the change was due to just this frame - dropping problem ? What about this ? phd c: y you had something on it . Sometime we we change two two things together and But it 's around maybe it 's less than one percent . But like we 're saying , if there 's four or five things like that then pretty sho soon you 're talking real improvement . Well , we can do the frame - dropping on the server side or we can just be careful at the terminal side to send a couple of more frames before and after , and So . phd a: You have ,  So when you  , maybe I don't quite understand how this works , but , couldn't you just send all of the frames , but mark the ones that are supposed to be dropped ? Cuz you have a bunch more bandwidth .  , it it always seemed to us that it would be kind of nice to in addition to , reducing insertions , actually use up less bandwidth . phd a: If the net 's on the server side then it could use all of the frames . It 's , like , you mean you just transferred everything and then finally drop the frames after the neural net . Right now we are  , ri Right now what wha what we did is , like , we just mark we just have this additional bit which goes around the features , saying it 's currently a it 's a speech or a nonspeech . phd c: So there is no frame - dropping till the final features , like , including the deltas are computed . phd c: And after the deltas are computed , you just pick up the ones that are marked silence and then drop them . professor b: So it would be more or less the same thing with the neural net , I guess , actually . Yeah , that 's what that 's what that 's what , this is doing right now . So , what 's ,  ? That 's that 's a good set of work that that ,  phd c: Just one more thing . Like , should we do something f more for the noise estimation , because we still ? professor b: Yeah . I tried just plugging the , Guenter noise estimation on this system , and it  , it got worse . professor b: it does seem like , you know , i i i i some compromise between always depending on the first fifteen frames and a a always depending on a a pause is is is a good idea .  , maybe you have to weight the estimate from the first - teen fifteen frames more heavily than than was done in your first attempt . No , do you have any way of assessing how well or how poorly the noise estimation is currently doing ? phd e: Mmm . phd e: We don't have nothing that phd c: Is there was there any experiment with ? Well , I I did The only experiment where I tried was I used the channel zero VAD for the noise estimation and frame - dropping . So I don't have a I don't have a split , like which one helped more . phd c: So , that 's the professor b: So that 's something you could do with , this final system . professor b: If it 's , you know , essentially not better , then it 's probably not worth phd e: Yeah . It 's , like , ev even even if I use a channel zero VAD , I 'm just averaging the the s power spectrum . But the Guenter 's argument is , like , if it is a non - stationary segment , then he doesn't update the noise spectrum . So , th the Guenter was arguing that , even if you have a very good VAD , averaging it , like , over the whole thing is not a good idea . phd c: Because you 're averaging the stationary and the non - stationary , and finally you end up getting something which is not really the s because , you anyway , you can't remove the stationary part fr  , non - stationary part from the signal . So , that 's so that 's still a slight difference from what Guenter is trying  professor b: Well , yeah . And and also there 's just the fact that , eh , although we 're trying to do very well on this evaluation , we actually would like to have something that worked well in general . And , relying on having fifteen frames at the front or something is is pretty phd c: Yeah , yeah .  , it 'd certainly be more robust to different kinds of input if you had at least some updates . What what do you ,  what do you guys see as as being what you would be doing in the next week , given wha what 's happened ? phd c: Cure the VAD ? phd e: Yeah . phd e: So , should we keep the same ? I think we might try to keep the same idea of having a neural network , but training it on more data and adding better features , I think , but because the current network is just PLP features . phd e: There 's no RASTA , no phd a: So , I I don't remember what you said the answer to my , question earlier . Will you will you train the net on after you 've done the spectral subtraction or the Wiener filtering ? professor b: This is a different net . phd c: So we have a VAD which is like neur that 's a neural net . phd c: So , right now we have , like ,  we have the cleaned - up features , so we can have a better VAD by training the net on the cleaned - up speech . So it 's , like , where do we want to put the VAD ?  , it 's like phd a: Can you use the same net to do both , or ? phd c: For phd a: Can you use the same net that you that I was talking about to do the VAD ? phd c:   phd c: So the net the final net  , which is the feature net so that actually comes after a chain of , like , LDA plus everything . And and you can actually do it for final frame - dropping , but not for the VA - f noise estimation . professor b: You see , the idea is that the , initial decision to that that you 're in silence or speech happens pretty quickly . phd a: Cuz that 's used by some of these other ? professor b: And that Yeah . And that 's sort of fed forward , and and you say \" well , flush everything , it 's not speech anymore \" . professor b: it is used ,  Yeah , it 's only used f Well , it 's used for frame - dropping . professor b: because , you know , there 's if you have more than five hundred milliseconds of of of nonspeech then you figure it 's end of utterance or something like that .  , keeping the same method but but , seeing if you cou but ,  noise estimation could be improved . And then , later on in the month I think we wanna start including the neural net at the end . phd a: So , Hynek is coming back next week , you said ? professor b: Yeah , that 's the plan . professor b: I guess the week after he 'll be , going back to Europe , and so we wanna phd a: Is he in Europe right now or is he up at ? professor b: No , no .  , the idea was that , we 'd we 'd sort out where we were going next with this with this work before he , left on this next trip .  , Barry , you just got through your quals , so I don't know if you have much to say . No , just , looking into some some of the things that , John Ohala and Hynek , gave as feedback , as as a starting point for the project . In in my proposal , I I was thinking about starting from a set of , phonological features , or a subset of them . grad d: He said , these these phonological features are are sort of figments of imagination also . grad d: Ye professor b: But we don't have too much trouble recognizing synthetic speech since we create it in the first place . grad d: just looking at the data and seeing what 's similar and what 's not similar . grad d: So , I 'm I 'm , taking a look at some of , Sangita 's work on on TRAPS . She did something where ,  w where the TRAPS learn She clustered the the temporal patterns of , certain certain phonemes in in m averaged over many , many contexts . grad d: And , so , those are interesting things to phd a: So you 're now you 're sort of looking to try to gather a set of these types of features ? grad d: Right . grad d: you know ? A a a set of small features and continue to iterate and find , a better set "

        "Query": "What were the thoughts of the Project Manager and the Industrial Designer regarding the energy source for the project, and why was the idea of using solar energy rejected?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager expressed a preference for a disposable remote control that does not have a battery compartment and relies on predetermined battery life. The idea of using permanent batteries was also proposed. On the other hand, the Industrial Designer initially suggested rechargeable energy sources and later proposed a combination of solar and conventional batteries. This would allow the remote to use light as an energy source during the day and switch to the battery at night. However, the convenience of solar energy at night and the cost implications were questioned by the Industrial Designer.",
        "Article": "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

Speaker fe008 is currently working on ensuring clean and properly coded transcripts, while speaker mn014's multi-channel speech/non-speech segmenter is being utilized. To save time, speaker mn005 will only mark regions of overlapping speech in the transcribed data. The task of extracting digits will be assigned to the person working on acoustics for the Meeting Recorder project.",
        "Article": "professor c: So ,  grad f: so I wanted to discuss digits briefly , but that won't take too long . OK , agenda items , we have digits , What else we got ? phd a: New version of the presegmentation . postdoc b: do we wanna say something about the , an update of the , transcript ? phd g: Yeah , why don't you summarize the professor c: Update on transcripts . phd g: And I guess that includes some the filtering for the , the ASI refs , too . professor c: Filtering for what ? phd g: For the references that we need to go from the the fancy transcripts to the sort of brain - dead . postdoc b: It 'll it 'll be basically it 'll be a re - cap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning . OK well , the , w  as you can see from the numbers on the digits we 're almost done . You know , someone fills out the form and then they 're not at the meeting and so it 's blank . And so , once we 're it 's done it would be very nice to train up a recognizer and actually start working with this data . phd d: So we 'll have a corpus that 's the size of TI - digits ? grad f: And so One particular test set of TI - digits . grad f: So , I I extracted , Ther - there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test set . It had been randomized and so on phd d:  grad f: and that 's just what I used to generate the order . professor c: So , I 'm impressed by what we could do , Is take the standard training set for TI - digits , train up with whatever , you know , great features we think we have ,  for instance , and then test on  this test set . grad f:  professor c: And presumably  it should do reasonably well on that , and then , presumably , we should go to the distant mike , and it should do poorly . professor c: And then we should get really smart over the next year or two , and it that should get better . grad f: so that the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that . And so I have a set of scripts and X Waves where you just select the portion , hit R , it tells you what the next one should be , and you just look for that . You know , so it it 'll put on the screen , \" The next set is six nine , nine two two \" . And you find that , and , hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format . professor c: So is this grad f: And so the the question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? Well , some of us . I 've been do I 've done , eight meetings , something like that , just by hand .  professor c: what what do you think ? postdoc b: My feeling is that we discussed this right before coffee and I think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them . And also it is contributing to the , c composition of the transcript cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript . grad f: There is there is professor c: So you think it 's fine to have the transcribers do it ? postdoc b:   grad f: There 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically . grad f: And so it 's just , you know , typing in name , times time , date , and so on .  , which again either they can do , but it is , you know , firing up an editor , or , again , I can do . postdoc b: And , that , you know , I 'm not , that that one I 'm not so sure if it 's into the the , things that , I , wanted to use the hours for , because the , the time that they 'd be spending doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on . postdoc b: But that 's really your choice , it 's your phd d: So are these two separate tasks that can happen ? Or do they have to happen at the same time before grad f: No they don't have this you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they don't have to happen at the same time . grad f: So it 's it 's just I have a file whi which has this information on it , and then when you start using my scripts , for extracting the times , it adds the times at the bottom of the file . And so , it 's easy to create the files and leave them blank , and so actually we could do it in either order . grad f: it 's it 's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double - check , to make sure you 're entering for the right person . Yeah just by way of  , a  , order of magnitude , we 've been working with this Aurora ,  data set . And , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , is about ,  I think the best score was something like five percent , error , per digit . So So the The point there , and this is  car noise  ,  things , but but real real situation , phd d:   professor c: well , \" real \" , the  there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as as this sort of thing , close versus distant .  but in a car , instead of instead of having a projector noise it 's it 's car noise . So , that 's that 's an indication ,  that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth , so . More typical numbers like phd d: Although the models weren't , that good , right ?  , the models are pretty crappy ? professor c: You 're right . I think that we could have done better on the models , but the thing is that we got this this is the kind of typical number , for all of the , things in this task , all of the , languages . Anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . phd d: How did we do on the TI - digits ? grad f: Well the prosodics are so much different s it 's gonna be , strange . grad f: So I 'm I 'm not sure how much of effect that will have . phd d: H how do phd g: What do you mean , the prosodics ? grad f: just what we were talking about with grouping . That with these , the grouping , there 's no grouping at all , and so it 's just the only sort of discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end . phd g: So what are they doing in Aurora , are they reading actual phone numbers , grad f: Aurora I don't know . phd g: or , a a digit at a time , or ? professor c: I 'm not sure how phd g: Cuz it 's professor c: no , no  it 's connected it 's connected , digits , phd g: Connected . phd g: So there 's also the not just the prosody but the cross the cross - word modeling is probably quite different . phd d: H How grad f: But in TI - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that , phd g: Right . phd d: do we do on TI - digits ? grad f: so it 's gonna be different . grad f: One and a half percent , two percent , something like that ? professor c: I th no I think we got under a percent , but it was but it 's but  . The very best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at at Bell Labs , or . It s strikes me that there are more each of them is more informative because it 's so , random , grad f: OK . professor c: But I think a lot of systems sort of get half a percent , or three - quarters a percent , grad f: Right . grad f: But that  it 's really it 's it 's close - talking mikes , no noise , clean signal , just digits , every everything is good . phd g: It 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life , phd d: Pre - prehistory . grad f: OK , so , what I 'll do then is I 'll go ahead and enter , this data . And then , hand off to Jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits . One question I have that that  , we wouldn't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but I was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti  , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on . The only thing is I 'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena , in w i i The reason for doing it is because the the argument is that certainly with conversational speech , the stuff that we 've looked at here before , just doing the simple mapping , from , the phone , to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book , isn't right . In fact there 's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some , you know , some nasality is comes in here , and so forth . But , It could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's it 's for such a limited set , that maybe maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much . Di - an anybody ? Do you have any ? Anybody have any opinion about that , postdoc b: and that people might articulate more , and you that might end up with more a closer correspondence . phd d: Sort of less predictability , grad f: That it 's just postdoc b:   phd d: and You hafta grad f: It 's a Well Would , this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ? phd g: Well it 's definitely true that , when people are , reading , even if they 're re - reading what , they had said spontaneously , that they have very different patterns . phd g: So the fact that they 're reading , first of all , whether they 're reading in a room of , people , or rea you know , just the fact that they 're reading will make a difference . So , may maybe the thing will be do to take some very small subset ,  not have a big , program , but take a small set , subset of the conversational speech and a small subset of the digits , and look and and just get a feeling for it . postdoc b: H That could could be an interesting design , too , cuz then you 'd have the com the comparison of the , predictable speech versus the less predictable speech professor c: Cuz I don't think anybody is , I at least , I don't know , of anybody , well , I don't know , the answers . postdoc b: and maybe you 'd find that it worked in , in the , case of the pr of the , non - predictable . phd d: Hafta think about , the particular acoustic features to mark , too , because , some things , they wouldn't be able to mark , like , you know , tense lax . grad f: M I think we can get Ohala in to , give us some advice on that . postdoc b: Also I thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features , that professor c: Yeah , but I I I I was , like he said , I was gonna bring John in and ask John what he thought . It should be such that if you , if you , if you had o  , all of the features , determined that you that you were  ch have chosen , that that would tell you , in the steady - state case , the phone . grad f: Even , I guess with vowels that would be pretty hard , wouldn't it ? To identify actually , you know , which one it is ? postdoc b: It would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m more , g  ,  that 's I think about articulatory features , I think about , points of articulation , which means , rather than vowels . phd d: Points of articulation ? What do you mean ? postdoc b: So , is it , bilabial or dental or is it , you know , palatal . phd g: Well it 's also , there 's , really a difference between , the pronunciation models in the dictionary , and , the pronunciations that people produce . And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling professor c: Right . That maybe , although I think the meeting context is great , that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence . And you can go from not from that to the articulatory features , but that would be a better starting point for marking , the gestural features , then , data where you don't have that , because , we you wanna know , both about the way that they 're producing a certain sound , and what kinds of , you know what kinds of , phonemic , differences you get between these , transcribed , sequences and the dictionary ones . professor c: Well you might be right that mi might be the way at getting at , what I was talking about , but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I remember , when that happened , and , John Ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones . One you know , one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something , like , \" gonna see you tomorrow \" , grad f: And Or \" gonta \" . phd g: it could be \" going to \" or \" gonna \" or \" gonta s \" you know . And , that it would be nice to have these , intermediate , or these some these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well . phd g: Because , it 's not , that easy to go from the , dictionary , word pronuncia the dictionary phone pronunciation , to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of , representation . grad f: Well I don't think Morgan 's suggesting that we do that , though . professor c: Yeah , I I I 'm jus at the moment of course we 're just talking about what , to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it . So for instance , you might have someone who just has a wor has words with states , and has   , comes from articulatory gestures to that . But  , grad f: But What I 'm imagining is a score - like notation , where each line is a particular feature . grad f: so you would say , you know , it 's voiced through here , and so you have label here , and you have nas nasal here , and , they they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones . professor c:  this is the kind of reason why I remember when at one of the Switchboard , workshops , that  when we talked about doing the transcription project , Dave Talkin said , \" can't be done \" . professor c: He was he was , what what he meant was that this isn't , you know , a sequence of phones , and when you actually look at Switchboard that 's , not what you see , and , you know . It , grad f: And in in fact the inter - annotator agreement was not that good , right ? On the harder ones ? professor c: yeah  it was phd g: It depends how you look at it , and I I understand what you 're saying about this , kind of transcription exactly , professor c: Yeah . phd g: because I 've seen you know , where does the voicing bar start and so forth . phd g: All I 'm saying is that , it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said , and which syllables were reduced .  , if you 're gonna add the features it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries don't give you professor c:   phd g: because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion . phd d: So it would be it would be great if we had , either these kind of , labelings on , the same portion of Switchboard that Steve marked , or , Steve 's type markings on this data , with these . phd g: And Steve 's type is fairly it 's not that slow , I dunno exactly what the , timing was , but . professor c: Yeah u I don't disagree with it the on the only thing is that , What you actually will end en end up with is something , i it 's all compromised , right , so , the string that you end up with isn't , actually , what happened . But it 's it 's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened . And it 's more accurate than the than the dictionary or , if you 've got a pronunciation  lexicon that has three or four , grad f: The word . professor c: this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever , phd d: So it 's like a continuum . phd g: an and in some places it would fill in , So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere . phd g: So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram , phd d:   phd g: but you know what phone it was and that 's about all you can all you can say . phd g: And then there are other cases where , nasality , voicing phd d: It 's basically just having , multiple levels of of , information and marking , on the signal . grad f: Well the other difference is that the the features , are not synchronous , phd g: Right . phd g: Th - there 'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features . grad f: Well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system , that the states were features , rather than phones . phd g: And i if you 're Well , we we 've probably have a separate , discussion of ,  of whether you can do that . postdoc b: That 's Well , isn't that I thought that was , well but that wasn't that kinda the direction ? grad f: Yeah . postdoc b: I thought professor c: Yeah , so  , what , what where this is , I I want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind , so it should be something broader . But , The but  where I 'm coming from is , we 're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with , John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which , they , have , a m a multi - band system that is , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM , to  , estimate , the , value for m for for a particular feature . And this is part of a larger , image that John Dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this . And the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone and and , you know . But that that 's sort of what I was imagining doing , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not .  , but , Again , I wouldn't wanna , wouldn't want what we we produced to be so , know , local in perspective that it it was matched , what we were thinking of doing one week , And and , and , you know , what you 're saying is absolutely right . That , that if we , can we should put in , another level of , of description there if we 're gonna get into some of this low - level stuff . phd d: Well , you know ,   if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , You know , you The the question is , do they do that on , meeting data ? Or do they do that on , Switchboard ? grad f: That 's what I was saying , postdoc b: W Well it seems like you could do both . postdoc b: I was thinking that it would be interesting , to do it with respect to , parts of Switchboard anyway , in terms of , professor c:   postdoc b:  partly to see , if you could , generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be , based on the phone representation at that lower level . phd d: Well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on Switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions . phd d: You 'd have it , from the lowest level , the ac acoustic features , then you 'd have the , you know , the phonetic level that Steve did , postdoc b:   phd g: it is telephone band , so , the bandwidth might be phd d: It 'd be a complete , set then . So  i we 'll see wha how much we can , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing , phd g: Yeah . phd d: But it it might be good to do what Jane was saying  , you know , seed it , with , guesses about what we think the features are , based on , you know , the phone or Steve 's transcriptions or something . grad f: Alright , so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous , but then you could imagine , nudging them here and there . professor c: Well I think what  I 'm I 'm a l little behind in what they 're doing , now , and , the stuff they 're doing on Switchboard now . But I think that , Steve and the gang are doing , something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment . So  that 's probably the right way to go anyway , is to is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that , that , you know , tries , to label it all . postdoc b: So in in our case you 'd think about us s starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry , and then ? Or would we professor c: Well , regular dictionary , this is a pretty rich dictionary . It 's got , got a fair number of pronunciations in it postdoc b: But phd d: Or you could start from the if we were gonna , do the same set , of sentences that Steve had , done , we could start with those transcriptions . phd g: the problem is when you run , if you run a regular dictionary , even if you have variants , in there , which most people don't , you don't always get , out , the actual pronunciations , phd d: Yeah . phd g: so that 's why the human transcriber 's giving you the that pronunciation , postdoc b: Yeah . phd g: and so y they they I thought that they were professor c: Is that what they 're doing ? grad f: They are . professor c: Yeah , so I think that i i we also don't have , we 've got a good start on it , but we don't have a really good , meeting , recorder or recognizer or transcriber or anything yet , so . So ,  another way to look at this is to , is to , do some stuff on Switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it . professor c: And then , As we get , further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time , we can , do some of the same things to the meeting data . postdoc b: And I 'm and these people might they they are , s most of them are trained with IPA . professor c: Yeah postdoc b: They 'd be able to do phonetic - level coding , or articulatory . phd d: Are they busy for the next couple years , or ? postdoc b: Well , you know ,  they , they they 're interested in continuing working with us , so  I , and this would be up their alley , so , we could when the when you d meet with , with John Ohala and find , you know what taxonomy you want to apply , then , they 'd be , good to train onto it . phd g: It might be grad f:  you 'd you 'd want models for spreading . phd g: I was thinking it might be n phd d: Of the f acoustic features ? grad f: Yeah . phd g: Well it might be neat to do some , phonetic , features on these , nonword words . Are are these kinds of words that people never the \" huh \"s and the \"  \"s and the \" huh \" and the  These k No , I 'm serious . phd g: And some of them are , yeah , \"  - huh \"s , and \"  \"s , and , \"  ! \" \"  \" \" OK \" , \"  \" Grunts , that might be interesting . professor c: new version of , presegmentation ? phd a: oh yeah , I worked a little bit on the on the presegmentation to to get another version which does channel - specific , speech - nonspeech detection . And , what I did is I used some normalized features which , look in into the which is normalized energy , energy normalized by the mean over the channels and by the , minimum over the , other . And to to , to , yeah , to normalize also loudness and and modified loudness and things and that those special features actually are in my feature vector . phd a: And , and , therefore to be able to , somewhat distinguish between foreground and background speech in in the different in each channel . And , eh , I tested it on on three or four meetings and it seems to work , well yeah , fairly well , I I would say . grad f: So I I understand that 's what you were saying about your problem with , minimum . phd a: Yeah yeah , then I I did some some some things like that , postdoc b: Interesting . phd a: as there there are some some problems in , when , in the channel , there they the the speaker doesn't doesn't talk much or doesn't talk at all . Then , the , yeah , there are there are some problems with with with n with normalization , and , then , there the system doesn't work at all . So , I 'm I 'm glad that there is the the digit part , where everybody is forced to say something , professor c: Right . And , the thing is I I , then the evaluation of of the system is a little bit hard , as I don't have any references . phd a: Yeah , that 's the one one wh where I do the training on so I can't do the evaluation on So the thing is , can the transcribers perhaps do some , some some meetings in in terms of speech - nonspeech in in the specific channels ? grad f:  . postdoc b: Well , I have phd d: Well won't you have that from their transcriptions ? postdoc b: Well , OK , so , now we need grad f: No , cuz we need is really tight . postdoc b: so , I think I might have done what you 're requesting , though I did it in the service of a different thing . postdoc b: I have thirty minutes that I 've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels . postdoc b: And I could And And grad f: Hopefully that 's not the same meeting that we did . postdoc b: So , e so the , you know , we have the , th they transcribe as if it 's one channel with these with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts . postdoc b: And then we run it through then it then I 'm gonna edit it and I 'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart 's form format . postdoc b: And then you have , all these things split across according to channel , and then that means that , if a person contributed more than once in a given , overlap during that time bend that that two parts of the utterance end up together , it 's the same channel , phd a: OK . postdoc b: and then I took his tool , and last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts , I , tightened up the , boundaries on individual speakers ' channels , phd a: OK . postdoc b: cuz his his interface allows me to have total flexibility in the time tags across the channels . phd a: so , yeah yeah , that that that 's great , but what would be nice to have some more meetings , not just one meeting to to be sure that that , there is a system , phd d: So , current This week . grad f: Yeah , so if we could get a couple meetings done with that level of precision I think that would be a good idea .  , how how m much time so the meetings vary in length , what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you 'd like to have as your as your training set ? phd a: It seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes from from different meetings , so . postdoc b: OK , now you 're saying different meetings because of different speakers or because of different audio quality or both or ? phd a: Both both . professor c: Yeah , we don't have that much variety in meetings yet ,  we have this meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have  , couple examples of . grad e: Even probably with the gains differently will affect it , you mean phd a: not really as professor c: Poten - potentially . phd g: We can try running we haven't done this yet because , Andreas an is is gonna move over the SRI recognizer . phd g: cuz we 're running the evals and I just don't have machine time there . But , once that 's moved over , hopefully in a a couple days , then , we can take , what Jane just told us about as , the presegmented , the the segmentations that you did , at level eight or som at some , threshold that Jane , tha right , and try doing , forced alignment . phd g: And if it 's good , then that will that may give you a good boundary . Of course if it 's good , we don't then we 're we 're fine , phd a: Yeah . M phd g: but , I don't know yet whether these , segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words , will work or not . phd a: I I would quite like to have some manually transcribed references for for the system , as I 'm not sure if if it 's really good to compare with with some other automatic , found boundaries . postdoc b: Well , no , if we were to start with this and then tweak it h manually , would that that would be OK ? phd a: Yeah . phd g: but , I would have maybe a transciber , look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those . phd g: If they 're horrible it won't help at all , but they might not be horrible . postdoc b: How many minutes would you want from  , we could easily , get a section , you know , like say a minute or so , from every meeting that we have so f from the newer ones that we 're working on , everyone that we have . phd a: If it 's not the first minute of of the meeting , that that 's OK with me , but , in in the first minute , Often there are some some strange things going on which which aren't really , well , for , which which aren't re re really good . What what I 'd quite like , perhaps , is , to have , some five minutes of of of different meetings , so . postdoc b: And , then I wanted to ask you just for my inter information , then , would you , be trai cuz I don't quite unders so , would you be training then , the segmenter so that , it could , on the basis of that , segment the rest of the meeting ? So , if I give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to , to , providing tighter time bands ? phd a: I I could do a a retraining with that , yeah . phd a: That 's but but I hope that I I don't need to do it . phd a: I 'm I 'm not sure , but , for for for those three meetings whi which I which I did , it seems to be , quite well , but , there are some some as I said some problems with the lapel mike , but , perhaps we can do something with with cross - correlations to , to get rid of the of those . Well well what I want to do is to to look into cross - correlations for for removing those , false overlaps . phd g: Are the , wireless , different than the wired , mikes , at all ?  , have you noticed any difference ? phd a: I 'm I 'm not sure , if if there are any wired mikes in those meetings , or , I have have to loo have a look at them but , I 'm I 'm I think there 's no difference between , phd g: So it 's just the lapel versus everything else ? phd a: Yeah . postdoc b: OK , so then , if that 's five minutes per meeting we 've got like twelve minutes , twelve meetings , roughly , that I 'm that I 've been working with , then professor c: Of of of the meetings that you 're working with , how many of them are different , tha phd a: No . professor c: are there any of them that are different than , these two meetings ? postdoc b: Well oh wa in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the ? professor c: Yeah , speakers . postdoc b: just from what I 've seen , there are some where , you 're present or not present , and , then then you have the difference between the networks group and this group phd a: Yeah , I know , some of the NSA meetings , yeah . professor c: Do you have any of Jerry 's meetings in your , pack , er , postdoc b: no . professor c: No ? postdoc b: We could ,  you you recorded one last week or so . professor c: and and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that I think . postdoc b: OK , so if I , OK , included include , OK , then , if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour and I could get the transcribers to do that right  , what  is , that would be an hour sampled , and then they 'd transcribe those that hour , right ? That 's what I should do ? professor c: Yeah . So they get it into the multi - channel format and then adjust the timebands so it 's precise . professor c: So that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing , postdoc b: Absolutely . postdoc b: Oh gosh , well , last night , I did about half an hour in , three hours , which is not , terrific , professor c: Yeah . postdoc b: but , anyway , it 's an hour and a half per professor c: Yeah . phd a: Do the transcribers actually start wi with , transcribing new meetings , or are they ? postdoc b: Well ,  they 're still working they still have enough to finish that I haven't assigned a new meeting , phd a: OK . postdoc b: but the next , m m I was about to need to assign a new meeting and I was going to take it from one of the new ones , phd a: OK . phd g: So they 're really running out of , data , prett  that 's good . professor c: They 're running out of data unless we s make the decision that we should go over and start , transcribing the other set . postdoc b: And so I was in the process of like editing them but this is wonderful news . postdoc b: We funded the experiment with ,  also we were thinking maybe applying that that to getting the , Yeah , that 'll be , very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through . So , Liz , and and Don , and I met this morning , in the BARCO room , with the lecture hall , professor c: OK . postdoc b: and this afternoon , it drifted into the afternoon , concerning this issue of , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the SRI recognizer . And , well , so , I mentioned the process that I 'm going through with the data , so , you know , I get the data back from the transcri Well , s  , metaphorically , get the data back from the transcriber , and then I , check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that . And , I 'm going to be doing a more thorough editing , with respect to consistency of the conventions . And , then , I run it through , the channelize program to get it into the multi - channel format , OK . And the , what we discussed this morning , I would summarize as saying that , these units that result , in a a particular channel and a particular timeband , at at that level , vary in length . But it 's really an empirical question , whether the units we get at this point through , just that process I described might be sufficient for them . So , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gonna do , is , I 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after I 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . And I can do that , pretty quickly , with just , that minimal editing , without having to hand - break things . postdoc b: And then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , with the at that level , are sufficient . And if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece - wise , maybe it won't be the whole thing . So , that 's that 's what we were discussing , this morning as far as I Among phd g: Right . postdoc b: also we discussed some adaptational things , phd g: Then lots of postdoc b: so it 's like , phd g: Right . postdoc b:  You know I hadn't , incorporated , a convention explicitly to handle acronyms , for example , but if someone says , PZM it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from , the transcript what they said , professor c:   It 's like y it 's and so , I 've I 've incorporated also convention , with that but that 's easy to handle at the post editing phase , and I 'll mention it to , transcribers for the next phase but that 's OK .  , and also I 'll be , encoding , as I do my post - editing , the , things that are in curly brackets , which are clarificational material . So , it 's gonna be either a gloss or it 's gonna be a vocal sound like a , laugh or a cough , or , so forth . Or a non - vocal sound like a doors door - slam , and that can be easily done with a , you know , just a one little additional thing in the , in the general format . phd g: Yeah we j we just needed a way to , strip , you know , all the comments , all the things th the that linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with .  , but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models , or , you know , mouth noise , or , cough . And then there 's this interesting issue Jane brought up which I hadn't thought about before but I was , realizing as I went through the transcripts , that there are some noises like , well the good example was an inbreath , where a transcriber working from , the mixed , signal , doesn't know whose breath it is , grad f: Right . phd g: and they 've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct . And what we do is , if it 's a breath sound , you know , a sound from the speaker , we map it , to , a noise model , like a mouth - noise model in the recognizer , and , yeah , it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these , but , if they 're in the wrong channel , that 's , not a good idea . And then there 's also , things like door - slams that 's really in no one 's channel , they 're like it 's in the room . phd g: And  , Jane had this nice , idea of having , like an extra ,  couple tiers , grad f: An extra channel . So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel because maybe it was someone else 's breath , or  , so I think that 's a good you can always clean that up , post - processing . phd g: So a lot of little details , but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that . So the idea is then , Don can take , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer and we can , can run these . So when that 's , ready you know , as soon as that 's ready , and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get , twelve hours of force - aligned and recognized data . And , you know , start , working on it , postdoc b: And phd g: so we 're , I dunno a coup a week or two away I would say from , if if that process is automatic once we get your post - process , transcript . I 'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way , will be sufficient cuz I would save a lot of , time , dividing things . Just from I dunno how long were you did one ? grad e: I saw a couple , around twenty seconds , and that was just without looking too hard for it , so , I would imagine that there might be some that are longer . postdoc b: Well n One question , e w would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping ? grad e: No . No , but if we 're gonna segment it , like if there 's one speaker in there , that says \" OK \" or something , right in the middle , it 's gonna have a lot of dead time around it , phd g: Right . It 's not the it 's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment , it 's the fact that , there 's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place grad e: so it 's not postdoc b: Yeah . phd g: You know , if if someone has a very short utterance there , and that 's where , we , might wanna have this individual , you know , ha have your pre pre - process input . phd a: I I I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the those mult multi - channel , speech - nonspeech detections , if they would like to . phd g: So that 's probably what will happen , but we 'll try it this way and see . We 'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross - talk , and , noises and things . postdoc b: Oh I wanted to ask one thing , the microphones the new microphones , professor c: Yeah ? K . postdoc b: when do we get ,  ? grad f: they said it would take about a week . phd g: So what happens to our old microphones ? professor c: They go where old microphones go . grad f:  phd g: Do we give them to someone , or ? grad f: Well the only thing we 're gonna have extra , for now , phd g: We don't have more receivers , we just have grad f: Right , we don so the only thing we 'll have extra now is just the lapel . Since , what I decided to do , on Morgan 's suggestion , was just get two , new microphones , and try them out . grad f: Since they 're they 're like two hundred bucks a piece , we won't , at least try them out . phd d: So it 's a replacement for this headset mike ? grad f: Yep . phd d: What 's the , style of the headset ? grad f: It 's , it 's by Crown , and it 's one of these sort of mount around the ear thingies , and , when I s when I mentioned that we thought it was uncomfortable he said it was a common problem with the Sony . grad f: And I checked on the web , and every site I went to , raved about this particular mike . It 's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well , so we 'll see if it 's any good . postdoc b: You said it was used by aerobics instructors ? grad f:  Yep . professor c: For the recor for the record Adam is not a paid employee or a consultant of Crown . professor c: I said \" For the record Adam is is not a paid consultant or employee of Crown \" . grad f: The P Z Ms are Crown , aren't they ? professor c: Yeah . professor c: So if we go to a workshop about all this this it 's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings . professor c: Oh , yeah , what Which 'll be the meeting about the meeting about the meeting . grad f: Cuz then it would be a meeting about the meeting about the meeting about meetings . phd a: S s grad f: Pause between the lines , remember ? grad e: Excuse me "

        "Query": "Summarize the presentation on marketing findings, trend-watching, market inspirations, and the evaluation of two versions.",
        "Summary": "The remote control design should prioritize functionality, with a focus on a comfortable fit, clear and obvious functions, and legible text. The appearance of the remote should be visually appealing and eye-catching. To meet the Christmas deadline and stay ahead of competition, the remote needs to be in the market soon. The trend for that year was fruit and vegetable shapes, along with a soft and spongy feel. The star features of the remote should be narrowed down to one or two, with voice recognition as a potential option. Marketing identified three key findings: a fancy look and feel, innovative technology, and high ease of use. They aimed to combine these findings with the trendy fruit and vegetable theme and sponge material, while considering the preferences of both the elder and young markets. Specific topics discussed included color design, related symbols and pictures, and the placement of the business logo. Marketing highlighted three main inspirations: the customer's desire for fashion in electronics, the simplicity of technology, and the importance of aesthetics in the remote's shape and color. Evaluation criteria were established, focusing on a fancy look and feel, innovativeness, and ease of use. The Industrial Designer and User Interface teams scored the prototypes, with emphasis on look and feel, innovativeness, and ease of use. The decision was made to create a remote control without an LCD screen, improving the design to make it more visually appealing. All functions would be included in the same set, but some, like speech recognition, would be optional. The team would also explore different shapes and materials for the remote.",
        "Article": "marketing: Where are are all the other presentations ? industrial designer: I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be marketing: The conceptual or industrial designer: yeah I think so . Because I see only my own presentation user interface: industrial designer: No no no , can you go back one ? marketing: yeah . industrial designer:  'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that's it . industrial designer: 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the user interface: marketing: Ah , project manager: Ah . marketing: I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but project manager: You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . industrial designer: Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it .  we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to  f the remote control has to support . project manager: Yes ? industrial designer: Who wants to start ? marketing: Me first again or project manager: Yeah sure . So  the developments I will address them project manager: marketing: oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours .  Well the first aspect  was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . user interface: marketing:  nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours user interface: Yeah . Yeah you're just the user interface  ? user interface: It's better than than my  drawing . And I used  possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design .  I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you  what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking  type . If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours  , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not  solid straight lines anymore . user interface: project manager: industrial designer: There's a lot of options that we have to discuss .  we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . industrial designer:  the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . project manager: industrial designer: Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the project manager: marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know .  I wasn't able to finish my  personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . industrial designer: Well we have all kinds of hard  materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium .  we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . industrial designer: Electronics ? Yeah , maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement  for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . I first  chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . user interface: Or combine  both with a with one  project manager:  I think you can only fit one  source of energy on the industrial designer: Yeah maybe we marketing: I guess we can only choose one . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . I always chuck my  remote control around , so marketing: Yeah , just playing with it project manager: Yeah . It can be done , you can't harm it , project manager: S yeah it's safe . industrial designer: You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . marketing: So double curved is like this , this , this , or industrial designer: No it means curved in two dimensions . So  w single curved ?  let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . So  Yeah  yeah that's one thing  which I'm not sure  of how to implement it  into the remote control . project manager: Well the visual representation is not there with speech industrial designer: Design ? user interface: No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu  for functions and project manager: but you can Yeah . user interface: But do  j do we  do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? project manager: Both . Everybody says it so that's what's  yeah  Yeah in the in the last  meeting we  we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . And only the the L_C_D_ panel will  light up and then you can only  change the yeah the options . project manager: user interface: you have to  delete this but this is the the the simple  layout . user interface:  display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . project manager: You did read the minutes I wrote ? user interface:  project manager: You did read the minutes I wrote ? user interface: What ? A little bit I think but not not everything w industrial designer: I project manager: Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . user interface: But But this is the the basic  design  for the for the m yeah for the buttons . And  if there are older people they wanted more  yeah more  luxurous so that's an a also an option . Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ?  energy source , chip type , case type . industrial designer: Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and  and f audio function . industrial designer: I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , marketing: Kinetic . industrial designer: to be able to m project manager:  I didn't get any info on this . industrial designer: That's gonna be difficult huh ? marketing: The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? project manager: I have total here . project manager: Yeah the interface , maybe can user interface:  it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options  yeah .  do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . marketing: If you go to your homepage or something , you should industrial designer: Yeah I'm going there now . marketing: I got my fresh and fyoo fruity  picture  also  over there , so project manager: Ah you didn't draw it yourself . industrial designer: S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form  yeah serves the function , you know . industrial designer: where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And user interface: But it has also to it it has also to be  luxurous  for for yeah rich people . industrial designer: Yeah but that's that's the the problem  yeah the dilemma actually , project manager: Distinction . industrial designer: 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . industrial designer: Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , user interface: The colour Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it  make the colours with LEDs  beneath the the buttons . user interface: If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . industrial designer: To customise it and so  kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and people who want something , you know , different , or more  design , they can go for one colour project manager: Different . marketing: industrial designer: Just give me the thing that it's inside there project manager: Yeah but this this the is for the . industrial designer: A compromise between what ? project manager:  instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . marketing: Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? project manager: Yeah that would be an option . industrial designer: And I I'm I'm thinking  you know  a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . user interface: Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . user interface: If you have  it have it in your hand , you you you are not only  yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . Something to shoot at your television industrial designer: Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , project manager: industrial designer: That would be a nice way to use it but  , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think . marketing: Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have project manager: To switch from buttons to interface  . industrial designer: How about marketing: Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but industrial designer: Yeah I understand what you mean . marketing: That's  that's industrial designer: How about we do a  a pop-up screen , like the laptop . marketing: Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or industrial designer: And then if you want project manager:  so you have a the the side view . marketing:  maybe it's too much project manager: make this industrial designer: No  like project manager: . industrial designer: Yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . user interface: But you you want industrial designer: F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? user interface: okay . industrial designer: So w w project manager: No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . project manager: and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto   automatically . Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your user interface: That's but it's it's not industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . marketing: An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of  thin rubber layer or something like that . industrial designer: That actually will offer some extra protection for the project manager: Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . project manager: What kind of industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th project manager: Harder . marketing: Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there . project manager: industrial designer: That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f user interface: But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem . user interface: But that's that's very expensive  industrial designer: Like like you drew here . user interface: We we could make some some rubber  some rubber  yeah mouse , with which you can change  industrial designer:  project manager: Oh yeah . marketing: we have to make industrial designer: Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape . marketing: Yeah we we better so choose one industrial designer: And also the screen , you cannot mould it . marketing: But that's the kind of the idea , industrial designer: And then you can marketing: so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , industrial designer: You can place the screen here , which can come . marketing: yeah , you can use the button option project manager: So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? industrial designer: And but then I w I would marketing: Spongey . marketing: Spongey can be reached by means of industrial designer: Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here , user interface: . And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ? industrial designer: I  y eah that's what  . industrial designer: or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? user interface: industrial designer: I dunno . project manager: Yeah that's user interface: marketing:  bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so it's better to have  some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary  colours . industrial designer: Yeah we could make marketing: I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? Like some soft green or something ? project manager: Orange or something . marketing: Or and then user interface: Or blue ? Dark blue or marketing: Oh yeah yeah , dark blue industrial designer: We should use marketing: and then and then very bright ,  a yellow banana , an orange ,  a green apple , stuff like that , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah but the primary colours w we can  create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . If you make it  just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , project manager: user interface: also for the for the more  yeah for the people . project manager: Y marketing: So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . industrial designer: Like you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones , marketing: industrial designer: the you know that 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that  people lose their  remote controls often . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: So it not not only in in the colours of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or marketing: How do you mean ? project manager: Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . project manager: Well I think it's a bit too much but user interface: Maybe a industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is  pretty high . user interface: And which which colour should  should I give the the display ?  project manager: Who ? user interface: Or marketing: the the colour of the background of the display ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty  sixty six five thousand  colour , so yeah too expensive . J industrial designer: As long as you loo use  high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . user interface: maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? industrial designer: So that people with  with marketing: White backlight , and dark . Or is it  too expensive ? marketing: But maybe  they have to they have to have some colour right ? project manager: It's difficult . industrial designer: But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? project manager: Yeah you can industrial designer: Like the pictures I showed you guys . user interface: It's it's not industrial designer: The green ? project manager: Why ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? project manager: They have LEDs but they have a colour . marketing: How do you mean ? project manager:  they they don't determine the colour that much , I think . Yeah I I was think about a red  red LEDs and blue LEDs and project manager: 'Cause you have to print on them you have a background marketing: No that's that's too busy I guess . project manager: So you can't change the colour so marketing: You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . industrial designer: what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with  one coloured LED behind it . industrial designer: as the colour the And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , marketing: industrial designer: but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . project manager: Okay with  Don't mean to discourage you but  basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . project manager: Yeah  about user interface: marketing: So wh how should I do that ? project manager: Yeah I don't know . marketing: because you are going to design it on this board right ? project manager: Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . industrial designer: So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? industrial designer: Alright . user interface: Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So if you'll rather draw in paint or something industrial designer: Current colour ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah 'cause I have to  focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . And you have to think  how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . industrial designer: So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . industrial designer: so we kind of want the girlish marketing: project manager: That's included . Excuse me ? marketing: Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't  , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable . industrial designer: How do we   marketing: Erase ? industrial designer: or insert text ? project manager: I dunno . industrial designer:  I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather  a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your project manager: Jesus . industrial designer: 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and user interface: The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . marketing: I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but industrial designer: Exactly but the  but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . user interface: Yeah the display , industrial designer:  don't you think ? user interface: we yeah we can put a display . industrial designer: So the display we will put in here , the basic  functions in here , where it's most reachable . user interface: industrial designer: What do don't have to draw it exactly do we ? user interface: No it's it's  it's okay . industrial designer: So this is gonna be from the marketing: I is it if if this is from the side industrial designer:  from user interface: From the marketing: woah . marketing: So then it's like this , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ? user interface: Yeah I'm I'm industrial designer: The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . user interface: May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . user interface: Because here marketing: It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . user interface: But why why do we need  the flipping  industrial designer: you can adjust the angle to which it flips . industrial designer: Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that user interface: marketing: user interface: Yeah . marketing: user interface:  the the shape is okay but yeah ? I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping  mechanism . It's it's for for for more trendy  marketing: Yeah but maybe Yeah but maybe we we should then user interface: Because we have enough space . marketing: Yeah there the middle Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? user interface: Yeah and then h we sh  . user interface: marketing: Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . user interface: Yeah , then it's marketing: So there's a layer of rubber on the side . project manager: marketing: So no flipping but just user interface: No flipping or project manager: No flipping ? marketing: no . user interface: you wanted the flipping so industrial designer: Yeah I guess but   most votes count right ? user interface: But if you if you If you drop it it it just breaks . user interface: And it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . user interface: But there are more marketing:  they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their  remote  control . user interface: Okay wi industrial designer: Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . project manager: I don't see any power cables here so industrial designer: Let's see . But do we want  options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah I'm just thinking , if we i we wanna make something different project manager: industrial designer: right ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons "

        "Query": "What were the opinions of the User Interface and Industrial designers regarding the attractiveness and appearance of the product, as well as the price and ease of use, during the evaluation of the prototype and discussion of functional requirements?",
        "Summary": "The User Interface team believed that the product incorporated fashion elements to attract buyers, as some buttons were shaped like cherries and had a spongy texture. They also mentioned a banana-shaped wireless phone that sold for over a hundred Euros, making their product's price of just 25 Euros very attractive to customers. The product would offer basic functions, with the option for users to pay more for additional features such as an LCD and speech recognition with a microphone. To make the product look fancy and meet different customers' needs, the team suggested offering it in multiple colors instead of just one standard grey. During a discussion about creating a new product that was both fashionable and easy for elderly users to use, the User Interface team emphasized the importance of ensuring better usability and making the remote control visually appealing. The Marketing team also suggested considering different colors or shapes for the remote control.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? project manager:  well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: You have the same message of  Windows cannot  marketing: user interface: sen oh stand-by . user interface: project manager:  I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .  Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here  in the role of Industrial Designer . project manager:  we're going to do    a little tool training  for the tools we are going to use  during  the meetings we are going to have here .  then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,  and we will have a discussion .  is there any room for a little presentation ?  maybe during the discussion  section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it "

        "Summary": "The team discussed the use of different frameworks for the external file representation. While the team was familiar with Perl and preferred a flat file format due to its simplicity, the idea of using ATLAS was suggested. It was proposed to initially use ATLAS and evaluate its suitability before fully adopting it. The team also considered P files, but the concern was that they could become large. One team member, C, emphasized the importance of considering the learning curve of other options and believed that a flat file format works well for everyone. C suggested that Perl could be combined with external representations of ATLAS files to create a functional system. Additionally, C mentioned that exploring alternatives to P files could be interesting, despite the potential learning curve. Another team member, F, focused on dealing with prosodic features at the level of small linguistic units. F proposed attaching these features to words or segments, with the option of extracting smaller units. This approach would allow the team to build on their existing work without starting from scratch.",
        "Article": "project manager: Hello ,  this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . project manager:  the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but  in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . So ,  we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and  I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .  so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from  looking at   some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world .  the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan .  so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel ,  as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .  and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the  is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan ,  we've discovered that this year  fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . marketing:  so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy ,  has lots of technolog tech technology in it . user interface: marketing: And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . marketing: So  fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , project manager: Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think  I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it  later .  generally , generally  this remote control   should be should be something , in my opinion ,  the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position   inside the remote control . And  s  I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and  start reading and  learning how to use this  this  remote control . So what I found out that  as I said  I think it's better to put  more frequent    ke  buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . user interface: And maybe  just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And  also f   m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not  consume lots of energy . And my personal p  preference is  , as I said ,  just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used  that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or  number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put  volume change or s ch can  channel change buttons   in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task  he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . And also  I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . For example , a sliding or rolling   d  stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with  thumb . And  I dunno but  I think usage of a speech recogn  r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . industrial designer:  okay , so good news from me   for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as marketing: project manager: industrial designer: Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but project manager: This one , yeah . This this is just  one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just  I just found this , that our company  developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just marketing: Inch . industrial designer: Yeah , seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . industrial designer: Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .  first thing is  this will be the overall shape , no  I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device .  the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can   And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can  supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just  two batteries and solar cells , so .  the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is  seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . Then the graphical card  for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can  we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches .  I have to check what I wanted to  from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des  ov all the device . project manager: Can you fit any  for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . industrial designer: A all these things in in  in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , project manager: Okay . user interface: Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . marketing: This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: how big is it in reality ? industrial designer: Well , seven to seven inches . industrial designer: marketing:   have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? project manager: No , I don't think it's seven by seven , industrial designer: Yeah but project manager: I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . industrial designer: To be honest , I was project manager: Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . industrial designer: Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , no no problem , user interface: industrial designer: because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . industrial designer: So marketing: industrial designer: Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . marketing: So , what's the size of the device ? industrial designer: Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . marketing: Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still industrial designer: Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . marketing: Is it Can you hold that , or ? industrial designer: Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . project manager: A sm industrial designer: marketing: But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? user interface: industrial designer: W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , project manager: So maybe you can finish your presentation , user interface: project manager: and afterwards we will discuss about all this .  , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .  first I think energy it's a key problem because  it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? industrial designer: Not J  just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_  speech recognition and L_C_D_ , project manager: Okay . project manager: but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . marketing: So if we use s solar cells ,  where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? industrial designer: S  d doesn't need to be sun . industrial designer: Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that  that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . project manager: At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . industrial designer: Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? marketing: project manager: At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . industrial designer: Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . user interface: project manager: So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . industrial designer: project manager:  what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this  a such a a a screen . Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ? user interface:  . And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . You can take  some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f  taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So  seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one   How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . industrial designer: Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . industrial designer: Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . user interface: but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove  keys and just  having  , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . user interface: So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , project manager: Yeah . user interface: because project manager: The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . user interface: project manager: So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . marketing: So industrial designer: Okay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me user interface: A smaller s project manager: Yeah okay .  something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and industrial designer: Seven to ten banana . marketing: Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . user interface: marketing:  what other what other fruit and vegetables project manager: But it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but marketing: Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer: Well , but If it's If it If the banana is big enough . Well user interface: project manager: Yeah , and industrial designer: user interface: I think this is not good . project manager: The screen has to be square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite ,  with curves . industrial designer: But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . industrial designer: Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit  fatter than than the c c common one . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be   really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . project manager: So we are agree with the banana thing ? industrial designer: Well it we'll stick to banana , or ? user interface: Okay . project manager: So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . You have other thing to add to this point , or  no ? So ,  about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . You talked about the buttons on the side industrial designer: Like like peeling of the banana you s user interface: Yeah , peeling of the banana . marketing: industrial designer: First layer obviously spo Yeah , project manager: So industrial designer: w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . project manager: Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ? user interface:  project manager: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . marketing: I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , project manager: Yeah . marketing: you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and user interface: user interface: Yeah , some Something like a plastic cover covering  some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in  digital camera . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be  buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and  when  and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . project manager: Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . industrial designer: Well is it possible to make it soft ? user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . industrial designer: So I think if it's so then it's cool ? project manager: So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .  maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover  sticking to the to the all the stuff like  with magnetic p  magnetic  magnetic  materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're  while while  you are commonly using  buttons on the banana . industrial designer: Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and  how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b  So we need that the that the peeling  I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if  the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and industrial designer: It is possible , but , well if it marketing: And a and a banana . industrial designer: I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . project manager: And something we forgot , maybe ,  about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? marketing: user interface: Yes , I think . project manager: So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , user interface:  . marketing: user interface: project manager: And  , yeah , I  I think you should work together , s you  Hamed and Peter , to work  in a in a first prototype , and  more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together "

        "Query": "What is the professor's opinion on the pragmatic overview of the project and can you summarize the discussion surrounding it?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed potential improvements for their model, specifically focusing on MSG and multi-band. However, the professor acknowledged that the task was challenging and their current model was not yet suitable for a real system. Despite this, the team was enthusiastic about the Aurora data, which provided a more realistic scenario, and expressed their interest in continuing to explore the task. The professor emphasized the need for further work and encouraged the team to share any ideas they had for pursuing new directions. He suggested experimenting with MSG and multi-band himself and also recommended learning more about different acoustic environments.",
        "Article": "grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right "

        "Query": "Why did User Interface propose using more buttons in the technical function design and what were the advantages of big thick keys? Additionally, what did the User Interface discuss about the shape of the button and what recommendations did the user interface designer make regarding the problem of having fewer buttons?",
        "Summary": "The User Interface team suggested reducing the number of buttons for DVD control compared to the current design, aiming to keep the maximum number of buttons within ten. Taking inspiration from mobile phones, they proposed using big thick keys for the remote control, which are popular among younger generations and create a less cluttered and more spacious look. The team agreed on a round shape for most buttons arranged in a triangle, with a square button in the middle and four buttons for channel and volume control. The industrial designer recommended incorporating multiple functions into one button using a switch menu, categorizing functions and linking them to specific menu categories.",
        "Article": "project manager:  after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . user interface: The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . user interface: The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . industrial designer: On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype  they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , can't see underneath . industrial designer: So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very nice to stock you know , stick your finger in .  the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , user interface: Thumb-shaped . industrial designer: and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side . And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do . And did you determine  the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ? user interface: industrial designer: I'd say a single . marketing: Yeah , I think it's a beautiful project manager: It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed . project manager: Alright industrial designer: project manager: what's next in our agenda ?  we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with Courtney .  so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable  yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . user interface: Feel good meaning what ? marketing: Like does it feel good , like user interface: Physically , project manager: Right . industrial designer: Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . Okay so , we're using the criteria  for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ? project manager: Are we going to indi user interface: True or false , easy to use . project manager: I say we individually rate what do you say ? marketing: You guys project manager: Just orally . user interface: industrial designer: I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . project manager: Oh , and ma it's a prototype , marketing: Well , that's that's just like that's a clay , it's a prototype . user interface: But then I'm not fashionable , so marketing: Yeah , it's a two . marketing:  user interface: marketing: does it feel good ? project manager: Imagine , since we obviously don't have that . user interface: Does it feel good ? marketing: I feel like industrial designer:  the shape of it actually does  . industrial designer: marketing:  yeah ,  and it does it have voice  the phrase recognition on it ? project manager: Yes . It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , marketing: And there's no way you can represent it on here . marketing: Then yes , then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? industrial designer: It project manager: Well we don' have the you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . marketing: And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , project manager: Right . I'd go for a three or four on that one , so user interface: Yeah I go four . project manager: Alright , and the last criteria is it is it  user interface: Squishy and fruity . project manager: Well , we've covered that with the user interface: It's just trendy , basically . marketing: So  our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: and  hopefully we'll sell millions . industrial designer: How did you get that in there ? user interface: marketing: What ? industrial designer: The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit .  it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a industrial designer: Yep . project manager: But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . What do you say ? industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: marketing: Yeah , let's let's do a lithium . project manager: I think  I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically industrial designer: it's . marketing: We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced , project manager: right . We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , industrial designer: Yep . marketing: But it's Yeah , project manager: This ? marketing: but i so i industrial designer: Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . marketing: But will we w actually we'll need two , won't we ? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . user interface: Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and industrial designer: Push-button . project manager: Right I think she's industrial designer: But we just have push user interface: push-buttons . project manager: I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? marketing: Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . marketing: So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? project manager: I don't know , they might put us well , let's just . user interface: Two interfaces , is that what w should we s say ? project manager: Two or would it be three ? industrial designer: Let's call it th marketing: Or three , because of one on each side and one on top . project manager: and we're gonna user interface: project manager: button supplements the buttons are no  okay . Now we're gonna talk about the project process  and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result .  did we have a lot of room for creativity ? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership ,  teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas . Who want who would like to go first ? industrial designer: We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . project manager: And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? marketing: Oh , overall  I thought we did a good job like user interface: marketing: We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . project manager: Right , and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like marketing: And we're a fashion forward technology company . project manager:  what about  the teamwork aspect ? How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ? marketing: industrial designer: Yeah .  minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? project manager: Irritating . marketing: And the digital the digital pens user interface: Like it's information project manager: Yeah , digital pens . marketing: Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome . project manager: Right , laptops are extremely handy , industrial designer: It was wireless too , so . And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the marketing: And these things whoa . industrial designer: project manager: 'Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ? marketing:  we are really gonna sell this . project manager: For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . project manager: And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . project manager: If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think  that's not what technology . user interface: Well , that's why I don't like  Macs or Apples , just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . user interface: Exactly , so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , no , iPods They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs .  how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . user interface: But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . user interface: I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . marketing: We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf .  the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project , user interface: project manager: and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so "

        "Summary": "The marketing team suggested that the remote control should have only one button and be compatible with Windows media center, allowing it to operate multiple devices simultaneously. However, the industrial designer disagreed, stating that additional buttons, such as play, fast forward, and stop, would be necessary for a video player. The industrial designer also proposed using titanium for a tough and stylish cover, appealing to older customers. They emphasized the importance of using real titanium instead of titanium-like plastic or compromising the LCD screen. The industrial designer also raised questions about the remote control's universality and programmability, suggesting the need for different modes to send out signals. They also considered the size of the remote, given the complexity of integrating various technical parts. Ultimately, the industrial designer proposed an integrated material approach to reduce costs.",

B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "Query": "Why did the team have doubts about relying solely on speech recognition and eliminating buttons for the remote control? What challenges did they face in implementing speech recognition in the new remote controls?",
        "Summary": "Age group data for remote control use was not available, but it is acknowledged that many people may not want to learn how to use a new remote control. Despite this, certain buttons such as channel control, volume settings, and on/off are still necessary. The Industrial Designer raised concerns about the size and bulkiness of remote controls with too many buttons, while a small and slim design was deemed prone to being lost. The User Interface suggested a PDA or hand-held type of remote control, but this was deemed unfriendly in terms of unit price. Marketing expressed concerns about the cost and price implications of implementing voice recognition, arguing that the elderly would not find it user-friendly compared to an LCD screen. The Project Manager agreed with Marketing's opinion and prioritized the LCD screen over voice recognition. The Project Manager also noted the difficulty of implementing speech recognition in remotes due to noise interference, which was expensive to solve. However, the User Interface proposed a solution involving a signal-emitting device built into the TV and a microphone and transmitter on the remote control, utilizing subtractive cancellation of noise.",

The second concept is a fancy controller ,  so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,  they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g  industrial designer:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: It's very big , user interface: if you're project manager: yeah . marketing: user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . user interface: so maybe we should  use   technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and  gesture recognition . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but as the  expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface:  I think some time it's very  convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just  speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you have one brother and one sister marketing: Yeah project manager: and they want to watch their favourite  T_V_ programme , marketing: Yeah , but the project manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , industrial designer: Yeah but Yeah user interface: Yeah , it's very interesting . industrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I don't think it project manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , industrial designer: It's it's marketing: No . user interface: so it's c come to channel three , marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . user interface: I don't have to project manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager: Yeah , but one other question . marketing:  if you if if you use the basic user interface: No no we just  have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? Or ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's  because  this technology is   for limited wor or limited wor  lexical recognition , it's very project manager: Yeah , but   user interface: it's  yeah . It's marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . industrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem , user interface: No it's  Even for the f  because the the vocabulary the industrial designer: you know when you project manager: project manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that  Baba talked about is the international industrial designer: Yeah . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , the key , the key  the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some  adaptation marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or industrial designer: Yeah but you know . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . industrial designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe project manager: okay . user interface: Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah , but how will you user interface: So industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . industrial designer: because  the for example for Se user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to industrial designer: Oh really ? That's project manager: Oh . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , but we're marketing: No , but then it's it's like this  project manager: here it's  an object . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . user interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: No no it's n y if you lose it industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . project manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it we should give the  flexibility to the user and we think marketing: Okay , so you project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if  ,  I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , but marketing: But if if if it like doubles  industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . user interface: project manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that marketing:  industrial designer: It's not really the we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But  I think a user need user interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah user interface: Okay . user interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing: Cause for example yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but  we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah ,  project manager: You don't need to tune it . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's marketing: for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . marketing:  thi this  , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The then nn marketing: or user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See user interface: That's the same marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah .  , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two  project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: industrial designer: so . marketing: industrial designer: So I think project manager: I can industrial designer: Can you go to the next one ? I  it's not this one . industrial designer: It's  oth the oth so I marketing: industrial designer: It's the working design . project manager: It's okay industrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use project manager: industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager:  I think there's something wrong with your user interface: It did didn't r receive it . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with  user interface:  to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: exac marketing: project manager: You will had s some more information in industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with user interface: project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: industrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example  d  solar energy alimentation user interface: -huh . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have  both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities  for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: industrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . project manager: And what tha what about the  materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for industrial designer: or you know , you can have some project manager: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . project manager: And you think that we will be industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know  yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or  if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . industrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .  , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  i i it sounds good technically user interface:  . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Wha what we really see this year is that  everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then  if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion  from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: Spongy 'Kay . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like  industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like  industrial designer: Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be  enough to have something working well . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No wood but Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but  ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah ,  it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: Google and project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer:  maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface:  yes . industrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: so . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . And pf what can we think a supplement to marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something added value . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the  simple vocal commands recognition . project manager:  you will have to work more , Baba , on the  spongy way to to add spongy  touch to the buttons industrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and  the colour of the  the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . project manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us  modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the TORRENT schedule, intermediate categorization, and the professor's opinion on the neural net.",
        "Summary": "The professor expressed his frustration with the constant delays in the TORRENT chip schedule. Grad F presented his proposal, focusing on the section on intermediate categories and suggesting the inclusion of features from these categories as a means of reducing error. The professor was particularly interested in understanding the impact of the neural net on older models that lacked pure features. While acknowledging the potential for improvement, he also cautioned against overusing nets.",
        "Article": "grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right "

        "Summary": "The team discussed the integration of remote controls for different appliances into one, but Marketing raised concerns about the excessive number of buttons and suggested incorporating a menu display instead. The Project Manager and User Interface agreed, but insisted on keeping basic buttons as well. However, the idea of a flip top was rejected due to cost considerations. As a temporary solution, lightweight plastic was chosen as the material. The team aimed to create an original, trendy, user-friendly, durable, creative, and characteristic remote control that would be intuitive for users. They also determined the price, cost, and expected profit of the remote control. Creativity was emphasized, with the goal of introducing fashion into electronics without compromising functionality. Marketing emphasized the need for a fashionable, technologically innovative, easy-to-use, customer-friendly, uncomplicated, functional, and ergonomically-friendly remote control. The Project Manager agreed and added that it should be quick to learn how to use. User Interface highlighted the importance of channel switching and suggested keeping the remote control as basic as possible. Marketing proposed that the remote control should be multipurpose to compete with existing products. The Project Manager agreed to explore innovative use cases and suggested operating different devices such as TVs, video recorders, and DVD players with the remote control.",

My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Summary": "The company recommends incorporating its corporate colors and design into the product, including the option for different colors like pink or banana yellow and fun shapes such as animals. They also discussed the idea of using buttons with various shapes, like triangles for volume and squares for channels. It was agreed upon that the text on the remote should be clear and the remote itself should be compact. \n\nDuring the discussion, the group realized that balancing the budget and maintaining quality would be challenging. To save costs without compromising user experience, the Project Manager decided to use high-quality recycled plastic as the material for the remote. However, they were willing to invest in a cutting-edge lithium battery for optimal performance.\n\nThe company's slogan and design target revolve around incorporating fashion into electronics. While the idea of providing user-customizable skins was rejected due to the amount of work involved, they decided to add the company logo on the boot-up screen and introduce a dormant mode. This was because most people prefer a non-flashing remote when the TV is on.\n\nThere were two main reasons behind these design choices. Firstly, the unit price of each remote control was relatively high, at twenty-five Euros. To justify this price point, the features of the remote had to be satisfying and of high quality. Secondly, there was competition in the market from other TV remote controls. Therefore, the new remote controls needed to be special and different in order to attract customers.",

So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Query": "What is the current status of the digits data and what additional assignments were proposed?",
        "Summary": "The test set of digits data, which is almost finished and spans two hours, is nearing completion. Currently, digit extraction has been carried out on approximately half of this data. Moving forward, there are plans to explore the reading of digits in various prosodic groupings as part of future work.",
        "Article": " , why don't we s again start off with with , Yeah , I 'll get it . And then , given that , Liz and Andreas are gonna be ten , fifteen minutes late , we can try to figure out what we can do most effectively without them here .  , what else ? grad f:  professor d:  What 's SmartKom ? SmartKom ? grad f: we wanna talk about if w if we wanna add the data to the mar Meeting Recorder corpus . professor d: What what what are we collecting here ? phd e: Data ? grad f: So why don't we have that on the agenda and we 'll we 'll get to it and talk about it ? phd e: The SmartKom data ? professor d: Yeah , right . I think it was Andreas wanted to talk about segmentation and recognition , and update on SRI recognition experiments . professor d:  grad f: And then if ti if there 's time I wanted to talk about digits , but it looked like we were pretty full , so I can wait till next week . I think the a certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when An - Andreas is here since that was particularly his thing . phd e: And also the SmartKom thing should b professor d: SmartKom also , Andreas . professor d:  So , I think they 'll be inter I 'll be interested in all this , but but , probably , if we had to pick something that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they 're coming here . Or I guess it would be , you think , reorganization status , or ? grad f: Yeah . phd b: maybe I said maybe we said this before just that we met and we talked about it and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized and postdoc a: And I and I think a crucial part of that is the idea of of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back - up so that there won't be huge number of of added , phd b: Right . Not not much @ @ grad f: Although Dave basically said that if we wanna do it , just tell him and he 'll do a d level zero then . phd b: Oh , so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready , and grad f: Yep . So , I think we do need to talk a little bit about Well , we don't need to do it during this meeting . So , naming conventions and things like that , that I 've been trying to keep actually up to date . postdoc a: I 'm sorry , you 've been what ? Showing them ? professor d: OK . Well , maybe  , since that that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status . So , we ,  we did another version of the beeps , where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit . Chuck came up here and recorded some di himself speaking some digits , and so it just goes \" beep one beep \" and then the phrase , and then \" beep two beep \" and then the phrase .  , I think they 'll have a b easier time keeping track of where they are in the file . grad f: And we did it with the automatic segmentation , and I don't think We ne we didn't look at it in detail . phd b: And grad f: I sorta spot - checked here and there and it sounded pretty good . grad f: And , we 'll just hafta see what we get back from them .  phd b: And the main thing will be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them . phd b: And I think we 'll be able to do that at with this new beep format . grad f: so the problem wi last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any , or and they put in extraneous beeps . phd b: Yeah , one interesting note is  , or problem I dunno if this was just because of how I play it back , I say , SND - play and then the file , every once in a while , @ @  , like a beep sounds like it 's cut into two beeps . phd b: Yeah , and I I dunno if that 's an , artifact of playback phd e: Yeah . But with this new format , that hopefully they 're not hearing that , and if they are , it shouldn't throw them . grad f: Well , maybe we better listen to it again , make sure , but , certainly the software shouldn't do that , phd b: Yeah . phd b: I it 's probably just , you know , mmm , somehow the audio device gets hung for a second , phd e: Yeah . phd e: Yeah ? postdoc a: As long as they have one number , and they know that there 's only one beep maximum that goes with that number . postdoc a: Well , you know , actually , are we having them phd b: So th grad f: \" Seven four eight beep seven beep eight three two \" . postdoc a: Yeah , but are we having them do digits ? grad f: Yes . Because , we don't we didn't In order to cut them out we 'd have to listen to it . phd b: We can we can ignore it when we get it back , grad f: Although we could tell them we could tell them , if you hear someone reading a digits string just say \" bracket digit bracket \" phd b: huh . That 'd be what I 'm having the transcribers here do , cuz it can be extracted later . And then I wanted to talk about but as I said I we may not have time what we should do about digits . professor d: Le - let 's talk about it , because that 's that 's something that I I know Andreas is less interested in than Liz is , grad f: OK . It 's good grad f: Do we have anything else to say about transcription ? About IBM stuff ? phd b: Brian I I sent bresset sent Brian a message about the meeting and I haven't heard back yet .  , how 're we doing on the on the rest of it ? postdoc a: We 're doing well . postdoc a: And , I 've prepared , a set of five which I 'm which I 'm calling set two , which are now being edited by my head transcriber , in terms of spelling errors and all that . She 's also checking through and mar and and monitoring , the transcription of another transcriber . postdoc a: And , I 've moved on now to what I 'm calling set three . I sort of thought if I do it in sets groups of five , then I can have , like , sort of a a parallel processing through through the the current . postdoc a: And and you indicated to me that we have a g a goal now , for the for the , the , DARPA demo , of twenty hours . So , I 'm gonna go up to twenty hours , be sure that everything gets processed , and released , and and that 's that 's what my goal is . Package of twenty hours right now , and then once that 's done , move on to the next . But I guess the other thing is that , that that 's kinda twenty hours ASAP because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours , the more time it 'll be for people to actually do cool things with it . And and I don't think it 's possible , really , to do this full - time , but , that what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible . professor d: Yeah , I guess the So the difference if if , if the IBM stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ? postdoc a: Again . We 'll we 'll expect that they 'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections . postdoc a: And I you know , I 've also d  , discovered So with the new transcriber I 'm  So  , lemme say that my ,  So ,  At present , the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time . And , that sort of , is useful , and t you know , and then once in a while they 'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up . Well , I realize that , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version , and , the pre - segmented version is extremely useful , and wouldn't it be , useful also to have the visual representation of those segments ? And so I 've  , I , I 've trained the new one  , the new the newest one , to , use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time . Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation . postdoc a: And that 'll be something like I it 's ver it 's interesting . A backchannel , or postdoc a: Once in a while it 's a backchannel . postdoc a: Sometimes it seems to be , similar to the ones that are being picked up . postdoc a: And they 're rare events , but you can really go through a meeting very quickly . You just you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips . And , I think that we 're gonna end up with ,  better coverage of the backchannels , professor d: Yeah . postdoc a: but at the same time we 're benefitting tremendously from the pre - segmentation because there are huge places where there is just absolutely no activity at all . phd b: So they can they can , scroll through that pretty quick ? postdoc a: Yeah . So I think that that 's gonna , also eh , you know , speed the efficiency of this part of the process . grad f: so , we have a whole bunch of digits that we 've read and we have the forms and so on , but only a small number of that ha well , not a small number only a subset of that has been transcribed . And , Liz and Andreas actually they 're not here , but , they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment . And , again , I don't think we 'll be able to do with that alone , because , sometimes people correct themselves and things like that . But so , I was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits , doing a forced alignment , and doing the timing . What about just actually doing recognition ? grad f: Well , we we know what they read , because we have the forms . phd b: Right , Morgan ? professor d:  phd b: Is that what you 're ? professor d: Yeah , I 'm I 'm not quite sure what I 'm talking about . And , there 's the issue that that they we know what what was said , but do we ? grad f: so one option i professor d: Because people make mistakes and stuff . I was just asking , just out of curiosity , if if with , the SRI recognizer getting one percent word error , would we would we do better ? So , if you do a forced alignment but the force but the but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes , or false starts , it 's it 's much less c it 's much less common than one percent ? grad f: But that 's pretty uncommon . grad f: Well , I guess yeah , I guess if we segmented it , we could get one percent on digits . I 'm not saying it should be one way or the other , but it 's If grad f: But , Well , there there 're a couple different of doing it . You know , they 're doing it anyway , and unless we tell them different , they 're gonna transcribe it . professor d: Well grad f: And my my tendency right now is , well , if IBM comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good , just let them do it . professor d: Yeah , it 's Y you raised a point , kind of , euphemistically but , m maybe it is a serious problem . Ho - what will they do when they go hear \" beep seven beep seven three five two \"  , you think they 'll we 'll get ? grad f: It 's pretty distinct . postdoc a: Well it it well , it 'd be preceded by \" I 'm reading transcript so - and - so \" ? phd b: Yeah . postdoc a: So , I think if they 're processing it at grad f: it 'll be it will be in the midst of a digit string . grad f: So  it sure , there there might be a place where it 's \" beep seven beep eight beep eight beep \" . But , you know , they they 're they 're gonna macros for inserting the beep marks . We 'll have to see , but I don't think it 's gonna be a problem . Well , I I I dunno , I I think that that 's if they are in fact going to transcribe these things , certainly any process that we 'd have to correct them , or whatever is needs to be much less elaborate for digits than for other stuff . grad f: We have so many of them , and it 'd be nice to actually do something with them . Yeah , I phd i: You mean there 're more than ten ? grad f: Anything else ? Your mike is a little low there . So ,  You you have to go a little early , right ? At twenty phd i: Well , I can stay till about , three forty . professor d: So there was some  In in Adam 's agenda list , he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition ? phd i: Well , yeah . phd i: so , we had a discussion Don and Liz and I had discussion last week about how to proceed with , you know , with Don 's work , phd e: Ch phd i: and and and , one of the obvious things that occur to us was that we 're since we now have Thilo 's segmenter and it works , you know , amazingly well , we should actually basically re - evaluate the recognition , results using you know , without cheating on the segmentations . phd e: So phd i: And , that should be fairly phd e: And how do we find the transcripts for those so that ? Yeah . So , there 's actually phd e: It 's not that phd i: Why do you ask ? grad f: I could phd i: No , actually , NIST has ,  m a fairly sophisticated scoring program that you can give a ,  a time , grad f: Hand ones . phd i:  You know , you basically just give two time - marked sequences of words , and it computes the  the ,  you know , the the th phd b: It does all the work for you . phd i: So , it we just and we use that actually in Hub - five to do the scoring . phd e: So , basically you give some time constraints for for the references and for for the hypothesis , phd i: So , we ha Yeah . phd g: Maybe the start of your speech and the end of it , phd i: So do phd e: OK .  , so that was the one thing , and the other was that ,  What was the other problem ? Oh ! That Thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignments to train up his , speech detector . phd i: so that we could use ,  you know there wouldn't be so much hand labelling needed to ,  to generate training data for for the speech detector . phd i: So , you can you can phd b: It 'll give you a lot more data , too . So , it 's basically s I think , eight meetings or something which which I 'm using , and , it 's before it was twenty minutes of one meeting . phd i: That won't be perfect the alignments aren't perfect , phd e: Yeah . But phd i: but , it 's probably still better to have all this extra data , than phd g: Yeah . If you find that you can lower the false alarms that you get where there 's no speech , that would be useful for us to know . So , r right now you get f fal you know , false false , speech regions when it 's just like , breath or something like that , phd e: OK . phd g: and I 'd be interested to know the wha if you retrain  , phd e: Yeah . I 'll can make an can , like , make a c comparison of of the old system to the to the new one , and then phd g: Yeah , just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of just having that training data wh what happens . professor d:  another one that we had on Adam 's agenda that definitely involved you was s something about SmartKom ? grad f: Right . So , Rob Porzel eh , Porzel ? and the ,  Porzel and the , SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues . grad f: Basically they have one person sitting in here , looking at a picture , and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere . And , it involves starting I believe starting with a It 's it 's always the wizard , but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , speech generation system . And they wanted to use this equipment , and so the w question came up , is well , here 's some more data . Should this be part of the corpus or not ? And my attitude was yes , because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics , as opposed to just for language . So , I just wanted to understand it , cuz I I 'm  , hadn't quite followed this process . So , it 's wizard in the sen usual sense that the person who is asking the questions doesn't know that it 's , a machi not a machine ? phd i: Right . phd i: Actually actually , w w the the We do this I dunno who came up with it , but I think it 's a really clever idea . We simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session , and so then after that , the person 's told that they 're now talking to a ,  to a human . grad f: But of course they don't know that it 's the same person both times . phd i: So , we we collect we collect both human - computer and human - human data , essentially , in the same session . professor d: You might wanna try collecting it the other way around sometime , saying that th the computer isn't up yet postdoc a:  . professor d: and then so then you can separate it out whether it 's the beginning or end kind of effects . \" phd b: It 's a lot more believable , too , grad f: \" No ! \" phd b: if you tell them that they 're the computer part is running on a Windows machine . grad f: Abort abort , retry , fail ? phd g: So did they actually save the far - field data ? phd e: Yes . phd g: Cuz at first they weren't they weren't sa phd i: Yeah . grad f: and I said , \" well that 's silly , if if we 're gonna try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . professor d: S phd e: We wer we just wanted to do phd i: No , the the question is do we save one or two far - field channels or all of them ? phd g: Right . professor d:  grad f: That that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies , it 's nice to have the same for every recording . phd i: It 's to be traini to b training data and development data for the SmartKom system . phd b: Where does this ? professor d:  phd g: Maybe we can have him vary the microphones , too , professor d: Well , phd e: B phd g: or they 're different s speakers . grad f: Right ? phd e: But but I 'm not sure about the legal aspect of of that . phd e: What they or , is is that our data which we are collecting here , professor d: We 've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything that we did . professor d: I L look , it seems to me that if we 're doing it anyway and we 're doing it for these these purposes that we have , and we have these distant mikes , we definitely should re should save it all as long as we 've got disk space , phd i:   professor d: So should we save it ? grad f: And then professor d: Now th Yeah . professor d: anybody who 's training something up could choose to put it eh , to u include this or not . But it 's some other data we have , and if somebody doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can . grad f: So it 's It it I guess it the begs the question of what is the meeting corpus . So if , at UW they start recording two - person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus ? professor d: I think it 's I I think I th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key . phd g: What if we just give it a a name like we give these meetings a name ? professor d: No , it doesn't . phd g: And then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won't , postdoc a: Well this professor d: Yeah . So so s so part of the reason that I wanted to bring this up is , do we wanna handle it as a special case or do we wanna fold it in , phd g: and Just give it a title . professor d: I think it is a s grad f: we give everyone who 's involved as their own user ID , give it session I Ds , let all the tools that handle Meeting Recorder handle it , or do we wanna special case it ? And if we were gonna special case it , who 's gonna do that ? phd e: So . phd i: Well , it it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily . phd e: It it it postdoc a: I think phd i: But as far as distributing it , we shouldn't label it as part of this meeting corpus . phd i: We should let it be its own corp postdoc a: Well it 's it well , because grad f: I don't see why not . professor d: It 's scenario - based , it 's it 's human - computer interface it 's really pretty different . professor d: But I I I have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gonna do , but I don't think i it it doesn't match anything that we 've described about meetings . professor d: Whereas everything that we talked about them doing at at UW and so forth really does . So w so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things ? postdoc a:  . professor d: You can you can Again , as as I think Andreas was saying , if you wanna use the same tools and the same conventions , there 's no problem with that . It 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's you know . Right ? grad f: Yeah , but those are folded in , phd i: It might also be potentially confusing . grad f: and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . phd i: Yeah , I th professor d: Well , I don I wouldn't call reading digits \" meetings \" . Right ?  , we we we were doing grad f: Well , but but , I put it under the same directory tree . professor d: Well grad f: You know , it 's in \" user doctor speech data MR \" . phd g: Can we just have a directory called , like , \" other stuff \" ? grad f: Other . My preference is to have a single procedure so that I don't have to think too much about things . professor d: O - You you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you . grad f: If we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure , and someone has to do that . professor d: All I 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings . And similarly we 're not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings . But if it makes it easier for you to pu fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree , knock yourself out . phd b: There 's a couple other questions that I have too , professor d: You know ? phd b: and and one of them is , what about , consent issues ? And the other one is , what about transcription ? Are ? phd e: Transcription is done in Munich . phd i: That 's a that 's another argument to keep it separate , because it 's gonna follow the SmartKom transcription conventions and not the ICSI meeting transcription conventions . But I 'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or or some things . Do we h do we have , American - born folk , reading German German , pla  , place names and so forth ? Is that ? phd e: Yeah . professor d: Heidelberg grad f: So phd i: Exactly grad f: Disk might eventually be an issue so we might we we might need to , get some more disk pretty soon . grad f: We 're probably a little more than that because we 're using up some space that we shouldn't be on . So , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , seventy - five percent . phd b: Well , when I was looking for space for Thilo , I found one disk that had , I think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen .  grad f: Were those backed - up or non - backed - up ? phd b: Those were non - backed - up . The non - backed - up , phd b: I haven't looked to see how much of that we have . So , pretty much anytime we need a disk , we can get it at the rate that we 're phd i: You can I shouldn't be saying this , but , you can just you know , since the back - ups are every night , you can recycle the backed - up diskspace . professor d:  Yeah , I me and there 's been this conversation going on about getting another file server , and and we can do that . professor d: We 'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of of disk , I guess . phd i: Well , I think I think there 's an argument for having you know , you could use our old file server for for disks that have data that is very rarely accessed , and then have a fast new file server for data that is , heavily accessed . It 's the back it 's the back - up capaci grad f: It 's the back - up system . phd b: I think I think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines . phd b: And we 've got , you know , fifty machines trying to access data off of Abbott at once . phd i: I think I think we 've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it , but the What about putting the stuff on , like , C - CD - ROM or DVD or something ? grad f: Yeah . The the th phd i: But they wear out just from sitting on the shelf ? grad f: Yep . grad f: But the r the write once , and the read - writes , don't last . postdoc a: Would it be ? professor d: Year or two ? grad f: Yep . phd i: But if that then you would think you 'd hear much more clamoring about data loss phd e: Yeah . phd i: and professor d: yeah , all the L grad f: I I don't know many people who do it on CD .  , they 're the most fo professor d: LDC - all the LDC distributions are on CD - ROM . grad f: They 're on CD , but they 're not tha that 's not the only source . But if you go if you go k phd i: But , you know , we have phd g: But we have like thirty you know , from ten years ago ? professor d: We have all sorts of CD - ROMs from a long time ago . grad f: The the pressed ones last for phd g: usually they 're grad f: well , not forever , they 've been finding even those degrade . grad f: But , the burned ones  , when I say two or three years what I 'm saying is that I have had disks which are gone in a year . phd g: That 's what I grad f: On the average , it 'll probably be three or four years . But ,  I I you don't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails . phd i: So how about ? So so how about putting them on that plus , like on a on on DAT or some other medium that isn't risky ? grad f: I think th  , we can already put them on tape . Well , if if if you if they last Say , they actually last , like , five years , huh , in in the typical case , and and occasionally you might need to recreate one , and then you get your tape out , but otherwise you don't . Can't you just you just put them on ? grad h: So you just archive it on the tape , and then put it on CD as well ? phd i: Yeah . phd b: What 'd be nice is a system that re - burned the C Ds every year . professor d: Well grad f: Well , the C Ds are are an op phd e: Yeah . professor d: You know I would think grad f: So for archiving , we 'll just use tape . phd i: One one thing I don't understand is , if you have the data if if you if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once , then it 's backed - up once and the back - up system should never have to bother with it , more than once . grad f: Well , regardless Well , first of all there was , a problem with the archive in that I was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories an or recursive chmod and chown , because they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while , phd i:   grad f: and I was just , doing a minus R star , not realizing that that caused it to be re - backed - up . phd i: But but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be backed - up again . professor d: The b I think th the at least the once tha that you put it on , it would it would kill that . grad f: Sure , but we still have enough changed that the nightly back - ups are starting to take too long . So , what if we buy , what what do they call these ,  high density ? grad f: Well , why don't you have this have a this conversation with Dave Johnson tha rather than with me ? phd i: No , no . Because this is maybe something that we can do without involving Dave , and and , putting more burden on him . How about we buy , one of these high density tape drives ? And we put the data actually on non - backed - up disks . And we do our own back - up once and for all all , and then and we don't have to bother this @ @ up ? grad f: Actually , you know , we could do that just with the tape with the current tape . What kind of tape drive is it ? grad f: I dunno but it 's an automatic robot so it 's very convenient . phd i: Is it is ? professor d: Wh The o the one that we have ? grad f: You just run a program to restore them . phd i: But it might interfere with their back - up schedule , phd g: But professor d: No , we have s we Don't we have our own ? phd i: eh . professor d: Something wi th that doesn't that isn't used by the back - up gang ? Don't we have something downstairs ? postdoc a: Well they phd b: What kinda tape drive ? professor d: Just in ? Yeah . So your your point is , and I think it 's a good one , that we could just get more disk and put it there . professor d: Yeah , that 's basically what I was gonna say , is that a disk is is so cheap it 's es essentially , you know , close to free . professor d: And we can take care of that by putting it on non - back up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape . phd g: So , who 's gonna do these back - ups ? The people that collect it ? grad f:  Well , I 'll talk to Dave , and and see what th how what the best way of doing that is . phd b: It 's probably gonna n grad f: There 's a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you , and that 's probably the right way to do it . That 's what I 'm wondering , if grad f: Well we 're g we 're gonna automate that . phd g: you don't have to physically put a tape in the drive ? grad f: No . phd i: Yeah , but then you 're effectively using the resources of the back - up system . phd i: Yeah , just give a dedi grad f: It we already have it there and it it 's phd i: Well , I 'm saying is @ @ i if you go to Dave , and and and ask him \" can I use your tape robot ? \" , he will say , \" well that 's gonna screw up our back - up operation . He 'll say \" if if that means that it 's not gonna be backed - up standardly , great . phd g: What about if the times overlap with the normal back - up time ? grad f: it 's it 's just it 's just a utility which queues up . grad f: And then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can , you know , do it a a few days later or whatever you wanna do , after you confirm that it 's really backed - up . grad f: NW ? postdoc a: You saying NW archive ? grad f: NW archive . postdoc a: Yep And if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back - ups . phd i: Well , it if he you have to put the data on a on a non - backed - up disk to begin with . postdoc a: Well , but you can have it NW archive to you can have , a non - backed - up disk NW archived , grad f: Right . phd i: So that so that otherwise you don't you postdoc a: and it 'll never show up on the nightly back - ups . grad f: So , that means we 'll probably wanna convert all all those files filesystems to non - backed - up media . professor d: another , thing on the agenda said SRI recognition experiments ? What 's that ? phd i: SRI recognition ? Oh . Chuck , do you have any any updates ? phd b: N I 'm successfully , increasing the error rate . So ,  I 'm just playing with , the number of Gaussians that we use in the the recognizer , and phd i: Well , you have to sa you have to tell people that you 're you 're doing you 're trying the tandem features . It sai because  , the meeting before , you said \" OK , we got it down to where they 're they 're within a tenth of a percent \" . phd i: So so , when So I I had I ha grad f: That was a quick response . phd i: So , we had reached the point where phd g: I 'm well rehearsed . phd i: we had reached the point where , on the male portion of the development set , the ,  or one of the development sets , I should say the ,  the male error rate with , ICSI PLP features was pretty much identical with , SRI features . phd i: So , phd g: Is there less training data ? phd i:  phd g: we don phd i: No , actually there 's more training data . So ,  so then  Oh , and plus the the vocal tract length normalization didn't actually made things worse . phd i: So So professor d: So but you see , now , between between the males and the females , there 's certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range , than there is , say , just within the males . And what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the the m the SRI front - end . professor d: but now you 're looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine . phd i: Well ,  So I just d so the one thing that I then tried was to put in the low - pass filter , which we have in the So , most most Hub - five systems actually band - limit the  , at about , thirty - seven hundred , hertz . So ,  And I 'm now , trying the Oh , and suddenly , also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data . So , you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test . phd i: And you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test , and s more if you do it on both training and test . phd i: And so the It now helps , if you do it only on the test , and I 'm currently retraining another set of models where it 's both in the training and the test , and then we 'll we 'll have , hopefully , even better results . So But there 's It looks like there will still be some difference , maybe between one and two percent , for the females . phd i: And it is true that the ,  that the you know , we are using the But it can't be just the VTL , professor d:  - huh . phd i: because if you don't do VTL in both systems , you know , the the females are considerably worse in the with the PLP features . phd g: Well , what 's the standard ? Yeah , so I thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males . phd i: that ye overall , yes , but on this particular development test set , they 're actually a little worse . We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features . I 'm just wondering if that if if you have any indication of your standard features , grad f: What 's Are the freq ? phd g: you know , if that 's also different or in the same direction or not . professor d: You 're This is lemme ask a q more basic que phd g: Cuz professor d: is this , iterative , Baum - Welch training ? phd i:   professor d: Or is it Viterbi training ? Or ? phd i: It 's Baum - Welch training . And how do you determine when to to stop iterating ? phd i:  Well , actually , we we just basically do a s a fixed number of iterations .  , which Eh , we used to do only three , and then we found out we can squeeze And it was basically , we 're s we 're keeping it on the safe side . It might be that one more iteration would would help , but it 's sort of professor d: Or maybe or maybe you 're doing one too many . professor d:  it 's it 's phd i: No , but with Baum - Welch , there shouldn't be an over - fitting issue , really . grad f: Well , you can try each one on a cross - validation set , phd i:  . professor d: It d if you if you remember some years ago Bill Byrne did a thing where he was he was looking at that , grad f: can't you ? professor d: and he showed that you could get it . We can Well , that 's that 's the easy one to check , professor d: Yeah . phd i: because we save all the intermediate models grad f: Do you ? phd i: and we can professor d: And in each case , ho grad f: What ? professor d: I 'm sorry in each case how do you determine , you know , the the usual fudge factors ? The ,  the , language , scaling , acoustic scaling ,  phd i:  I  I 'm actually re - optimizing them . And the pru the question he was asking at one point about pruning ,  Remember that one ? phd i: Pruning ? professor d: Well , he was he 's it looked like the probabil at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out at the likelihoods he was getting out of PLP versus mel cepstrum , and they looked pretty different , phd i: Pruning in the ? phd b: Yeah , the likelihoods were lower for the PLP . professor d: And so , there 's the question phd i: I you mean did you see this in the SRI system ? phd b:   Well , the likelihoods are phd b: and phd i: You can't directly compare them , because , for every set of models you compute a new normalization . professor d: But , still it 's a question phd i: So professor d: if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something , phd b: Well , yeah .   phd b: if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihoods is in this area phd i: We prune very conservatively .  , as we saw with the meeting data ,  we could probably tighten the pruning without really So we we basically we have a very open beam . professor d: Right ? Here we 're - we 're saying that we there gee , there 's this b eh , there 's this difference here . Right ? But but but but , let 's suppose just for a second that , we 've sort of taken out a lot of the the major differences , between the two . professor d: we 're already sort of using the mel scale and we 're using the same style filter integration , and and , well , we 're making sure that low and high phd i: Actually , there is the difference in that . grad f: And what 's the top frequency of each ? phd i: Well , now it 's the same . But professor d: Before we i i th with straight PLP , it 's trapezoidal also . phd i: Well But professor d: But then we had a slight difference in the in the scale . phd i: Since currently the Feacalc program doesn't allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale . phd i: And , I did the experiment on the SRI front - end where I tried the y where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filters . So , it 's not I don't think the filter shape by itself will make a huge difference . professor d: So , f i We 've always viewed it , anyway , as the major difference between the two , is actually in the smoothing , that the that the , PLP , and and the reason PLP has been advantageous in , slightly noisy situations is because , PLP does the smoothing at the end by an auto - regressive model , phd i:   So one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with our full training set . So right now , we 're using a I don't know , forty ? I i it 's it 's eh it 's a f training set that 's about , you know , by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system . phd i: And the Baum - Welch should be much less of a factor , if you go full whole hog . phd i: And so , w so , just  so the strategy is to first sort of treat things with fast turn - around on a smaller training set and then , when you 've sort of , narrowed it down , you try it on a larger training set . professor d: Now the other que related question , though , is is , what 's the boot models for these things ? phd i: Th - th the boot models are trained from scratch . So we compute ,  So , we start with a , alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have . So we com we do a , you know , w  We collect the  , the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that that we train . And then , from there we do ,  There 's a lot of , actually The way it works , you first train a phonetically - tied mixture model . And then from that you you do the you you go to a state - clustered model , professor d: Yeah . This it migh Th - the thought is is is possible another possible partial cause is if the boot models used a comple used a different feature set , that phd i:   phd i: Yeah , but professor d: you know , they they will find boundaries a little differently , though You know , all th all that sort of thing is actually slightly different . I 'd expect it to be a minor effect , phd i: But but but , what I 'm what I 'm saying is professor d: but phd i: So , we e w f w For a long time we had used boot alignments that had been trained with a with the same front - end but with acoustic models that were , like , fifteen percent worse than what we use now . phd i: And with a dict different dictionary with a considerably different dictionary , which was much less detailed and much less well - suited . phd i: And so , then we switched to new boot alignments , which which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we 've made over two years in the system . phd i: So , what I 'm saying is , the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final models . But it it I st still see it as  , there 's there 's a history to this , too , phd i: Yeah . professor d: but but I I I th I think it could be the things that it the data is being viewed in a certain way , that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth , phd i: Yeah . Anyway , I I I should really reserve , any conclusions until we 've done it on the large training set , and until we 've seen the results with the with the VTL in training . At some point you also might wanna take the same thing and try it on , some Broadcast News data or something else that actually has has some noisy noisy components , so we can see if any conclusions we come to holds across different data . grad h:  ! professor d: So , is there something quick about Absinthe that you ? phd i: With this said . Just what we were talking about before , which is that I ported a Blass library to Absinthe , and then got got it working with fast - forward , and got a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle . grad f: I 'm in the process of doing it for Quicknet , but there 's something going wrong and it 's about half the speed that I was estimating it should be , and I 'm not sure why . But the what it means is that it 's likely that for net training and forward passes , we 'll Absinthe will be a good machine . phd i: A few more processors ? How many are you shooting for ? grad f: There 're five now . grad f: And it 's also five - fifty megahertz and you can get a gigahertz . phd i: Can you mix t  , processors of different speed ? grad f: I don't think so . grad f: We 'd have to get a almost certainly have to get a , Netfinity server . And , so , these are the demos for the  , July , meeting and ,  DARPA mee grad f: July what ? Early July ? Late July ? professor d: Oh , I think it 's July fifteenth . So , we talked about getting something together for that , but maybe ,  maybe we 'll just put that off for now , given that But I think maybe we should have a a sub - meeting , I think , probably , Adam and and , Chuck and me should talk about should get together and talk about that sometime soon . Gets our grad f: Which is gonna be a little hard for a couple people because we have different digits forms . So , the idea is just to read each line with a short pause between lines , grad c: Alright . grad f: not between And , since we 're in a hurry , we were just gonna read everyone all at once "

        "Article": "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

However, the opposition party expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the government did not reach out to enough businesses. They also criticized the rigidity and difficulty of the rent relief program. The Prime Minister reiterated that the government's priority has always been to support workers in need and prevent job losses across all organizations and companies. The Minister of Canadian Heritage emphasized the government's commitment to transparency during the crisis, but the opposition party questioned the allocation of $35 billion in infrastructure funds, suspecting that it may have been used for personal salaries. The government assured that they have been actively exploring ways to enhance contact tracing capabilities in collaboration with provinces, territories, and volunteer organizations, while also addressing concerns raised by the Privacy Commissioner regarding privacy and ethical considerations. Additionally, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced a funding of $500 million to support Canada's arts, sports, and cultural sectors, with further details to be released in the coming days.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to meeting number 22 of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. A reminder to all members that in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not also be connected to the video conference. For those joining via video conference, I would like to remind you that, when speaking, you should be on the same channel as the language you are speaking. I understand we don't have any ministerial announcements today, so we'll proceed to presenting petitions. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificate off at the table once the petition is presented. Chair, it's an honour to rise in meeting number 22 of the COVID-19 committee, otherwise known as something like the House of Commons. I'm here to present two petitions containing hundreds of signatures on the issue of the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners by the People's Republic of China, particularly the practice that's alleged of involuntary organ harvesting. The petitioners ask the Government of Canada to condemn this practice and to publicly call for an end to the persecution of Falun Gong in the People's Republic of China. The second petition is from residents throughout SaanichGulf Islands concerned about what was, at the time this petition was submitted, a future problem. It remains an issue, and I present it on behalf of petitioners who wish the Government of Canada not to put public funds into purchasing or maintaining the Trans Mountain pipeline or towards any expansion of the pipeline. The petitioners note the pandemic is having a devastating impact on many Canadians nationwide, especially those who have low to modest income, small business gig workers, freelancers, artists, film industry workers, non-salaried workers and individuals on fixed incomes such as seniors and those on disability. It further notes that rent, mortgage and utility payments are due at the end of each month, putting countless Canadians at risk of losing their housing. To that end, the petitioners are calling for the government to immediately enact a nationwide rent freeze, eviction freeze, mortgage freeze and utility freeze, enforce mortgage deferrals for homeowners without penalty or interest charges from financial institutions and provide direct assistance in the form of a monthly, universal, direct payment of $2,000 per month for all, with an additional $250 per child immediately. Trans Mountain, in building the pipeline, brings massive environmental and economic risk with no substantial benefit to British Columbia or to local residents. Approximately 40,000 barrels of oil have already leaked from existing Kinder Morgan pipelines, including two major spills in Burnaby since 2007. Chair, that just this past weekend there was yet another spill to the tune of 1,195 barrels here in British Columbia. There is no known scientific technology to clean up the bitumen when there is a spill, and the number of tankers would go from eight to 34 per month into the Burrard Inlet. I want to remind all members in the House that when presenting a petition, the idea is to be as concise as possible. The petitioners are calling for the government to immediately act to prevent this new oil pipeline from proceeding through British Columbia. The first petition reflects the outrage of my constituents at the ever-expanding order in council from the government banning more and more firearms. In particular, the petitioners highlight the failure of the government to act on the issue of illegal guns. The petitioners note that virtually all violent crimes committed in Canada, including the recent shooting in Nova Scotia, involve illegal firearms in the hands of those who are already not permitted to possess them. First of all, it asks that we reverse the order in council banning certain firearms, but also that we propose measures that will effectively address the illegal use of firearms by criminals while respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. It also asks that we ensure that substantial changes to firearms laws in future actually be made by Parliament, not by the government acting in an unaccountable manner. The second petition deals with Bill C-8, which is the government's bill around conversion therapy. They're asking the government to support amendments to fix the definition to address the issue of conversion therapy and ensure that the definition is correct and doesn't criminalize certain forms of counselling that individuals may voluntarily enter into. The third petition is regarding Bill S-204, a bill in the Senate that seeks to make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad to receive an organ without consent, dealing especially with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking in China. There's been much discussion in this House about the need to do better in terms of long-term care. Rather than working to do better in long-term care, unfortunately we've seen the government removing vital safeguards in the area of euthanasia. I think our focus should be on assisting life rather than removing safeguards that are required in association with the euthanasia regime. The petitioners are particularly concerned about the government's plan to remove a 10-day reflection period that normally takes place. That period can already be waived under certain circumstances, but Bill C-7 proposes to remove it entirely as well as reduce the number of witnesses involved. The petitioners are quite concerned about what's going on in Bill C-7 and call for it to be stopped or amended. Racialized and marginalized communities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. We need to do the same for the climate crisis, because humanity and our planet are too big to fail. At risk of neglect and assault, many of the most vulnerable older persons reside in our long-term care facilities. They are the seniors who have built our country and shaped our communities, who have shown us resilience, courage and selflessness, who have made us stronger, and whose work and teachings continue to inspire us. We have not been there for them in the same way they've been there for us throughout their lives. The Canadian Forces report, alongside the climbing disproportionate death toll in our long-term care facilities, has reconfirmed the ugly, indefensible reality of elder abuse and neglect in Canada. In my community, we mourn the deaths of 68 seniors from one long-term care facility alone, Camilla Care. the chair: Before proceeding, I just want to bring up to the members in the background that we want to keep it as simple and as parliamentary as possible in keeping it neutral. michael barrett (leedsgrenvillethousand islands and rideau lakes, cpc): During these trying times, the residents of LeedsGrenvilleThousand Islands and Rideau Lakes have risen to the challenge. They've made sacrifices and gone above and beyond to make the lives of their neighbours better and to keep our communities safe. It would be impossible to list everyone who has emerged as a community hero, but I'd like to highlight a few, like Lily, an eight-year-old from Elgin who raised funds for her local food bank by building and selling squirrel picnic tables, and Louise Boardman from Spencerville who's making masks for long-term care facilities and selling others in support of the Breast Cancer Action centre. The Knights of Columbus in Prescott raised funds and are distributing some $27,000 in support of charitable groups throughout the region. Who can forget our top-notch health care workers like Hannah and Mary at the Brockville COVID-19 testing centre? It is the people of LeedsGrenvilleThousand Islands and Rideau Lakes that make it so great. Chair, the Indian Act enshrined racism into Canadian law in 1876, and, through residential schools, the child welfare system, our legal system and our police, we criminalized and tore apart indigenous peoples. The deaths of Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi and the assault on Chief Allan Adam are recent examples of systemic racism within the RCMP. Anti-black racism has resulted in more young black men being jailed, children being streamed or excluded from schools and negative police interaction due to profiling. It is now time to reimagine and rework our institutions, starting with our police, to ensure that all Canadians can achieve their truest potential. andranne larouche (shefford, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. That's why the increase in the old age security benefit and the guaranteed income supplement must be extended beyond the pandemic. In three weeks, our seniors will receive their first cheque, when they should be receiving their second. A date must also be announced for the new horizons for seniors program, which helps several groups develop projects to break the isolation of seniors. In closing, I would like to mention the organization Justice alternative et mdiation that during the pandemic, along with other organizations in Shefford, has set up the project Une histoire pour la tienne, which also serves to mark this day. It's a virtual meeting between young people and seniors, allowing them to exchange some inspiring life experiences. Since age prejudice is very much present, I applaud this project, which aims to make us understand each other better and judge each other less. Chair, in the time of this terrible crisis affecting all Canadians, when we are all thinking about how best to deal with it, let's all think about the people around us. Let's show our representation not only to those in the sector of sanctioned workers, but also to all those Canadians who day by day stand up and make a difference. I want to acknowledge and celebrate all the contributions made by the people of Brampton Centre, all religious institutions, civil society and community organizations like Knights Table in my riding. Chair, whether graduating from elementary school, high school, Georgian College or graduating from colleges or universities across the country, I am proud of the accomplishments of all the graduates across BruceGreyOwen Sound. I would also like to congratulate and thank all the teachers and parents who have adapted to teaching online or from home and who have supported these graduates over the course of their academic careers. I'd like to extend special congratulations to Cameron Lovell, who just graduated from grade eight, as well as to Neebeesh and Neebin Elliott, originally from the Nawash unceded first nation on the Bruce Peninsula, who will be headed to Michigan State University, and to Jared Lumley from Owen Sound, who just graduated from my alma mater, the Royal Military College of Canada. The college motto of Truth, Duty, Valour is something all Canadians should aspire to live by. serge cormier (acadiebathurst, lib.): Today I pay tribute to RichardLosier, an entrepreneur, visionary and builder who died on June9, 2020, surrounded by his family. In1968, he co-founded St.Isidore Asphalte, a company that now has more than 200employees. He was unifying and generous, a philanthropist who cared about young people and never missed an opportunity to improve their lives. I met Mr.Losier when I was 14years old, and I can say that he has been a positive influence in my life. Every time I met him, he gave me a lot of advice and encouragement, which I've never forgotten. I offer my most sincere condolences to his children, Richard Jr., Ronald, Nathalie, Caroline and Stphane, and to his family and friends. julie dabrusin (torontodanforth, lib.): Hello from my community in east end Toronto. People talk about how a city the size of Toronto can be cold, but that's far from the truth in my community. Wong of Earl Grey Senior Public School, who delivered home-baked cookies and handwritten notes to all of his students, or Monsieur Steve, who's offering online French classes, or the teachers of Riverdale Collegiate, who paraded through our streets to celebrate our graduates. Our local Michael Garron Hospital put out a call for community members to sew masks and received over 60,000 masks, including those made by Lisa Tancre of Chartwell Avondale Retirement Residence. Restaurants, even while facing adversity, have been generously donating food, like the members of the Leslieville BIA or Mezes. There are so many more stories of generosity that I could share, but I'm out of time. Chair, on Saturday night, Calgarians, particularly those in the northeast, in my riding of Calgary Skyview, witnessed a devastating storm, the likes of which I have not seen in my lifetime. Homes, vehicles, community buildings and structures suffered significant damage due to large hail, floods and high winds. My heart aches for those who have been impacted by the storm in an already incredibly difficult time, but we are resilient. We know that in the coming weeks there will be a lot of cleanup required, both to personal property and in the community. I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to the people of West Nippissing who organized Pride activities to celebrate the LGBTQ community in June. I thank the public servants for their dedication to the Nickel Belt community and the Valley East and Rayside-Balfour areas. Chair, when COVID-19 began spreading across Ontario, Markham, like many other communities, was unprepared. When Markham residents heard about these shortages, my office was flooded with calls from people who had PPE and wanted to donate. Since then my office has been able to deliver tens of thousands of PPE supplies to front-line health care workers and five masks to each family in need. This pandemic has shown that no matter what the challenge is, the Markham community will overcome it. As we start to see local businesses reopen, it is important for all of us to remember to follow best practices outlined by local public health. It is important for all of us to respect social distancing, to protect all workers and their families. the chair: Again, my apologies for skipping over there, but now we'll to to Ms. Chair, in commemoration of Italian Heritage Month, I would like to pay tribute to the Colombo Lodge and Italian Cultural Centre in Kamloops, British Columbia. Recently they began Colombo Cares take-home dinners with proceeds distributed to different non-profit organizations throughout the region. Last month they very generously gave away hundreds of dinners to Royal Inland Hospital staff and paramedics for their tireless work throughout the pandemic. In their own words they say, Colombo Lodge is very proud of the Italians that have made Kamloops their home. Community members of Italian ancestrypast and presenthave helped and continue to help Kamloops prosper as a giving, welcoming and inclusive community. People are worried about what will happen when the CERB runs out in two weeks' time, and the coming tourism season looks very grim. The province itself is in serious financial crisis due to the pandemic and the decline in oil prices. The federal government must overhaul and enhance the fiscal stabilization program to help Newfoundlanders and Labradorians and other oil-producing provinces through this crisis. This is a challenge and an opportunity to transition to a sustainable energy future, but it will require significant investment and support by government to keep the industry strong and make this a just transition for workers. marie-hlne gaudreau (laurentideslabelle, bq): Mr.Chair, all 44elected municipal officials in the riding of LaurentidesLabelle and I have sent a letter to the government asking that cellular and high-speed Internet networks be made available to all. The territorial complexity of the Laurentians means that there are areas where the signal is weak, unstable or non-existent. Also, because of the lockdown, Internet failures are being felt, and they prevent distance learning, telemedicine and teleworking, among other things. How can our municipalities develop economically if they can't provide their community with adequate communication tools? We are therefore calling on the government to put the interests of its people first by investing massively right now in the construction of high-speed Internet and cellular infrastructure. kevin waugh (saskatoongrasswood, cpc): I rise today to pay tribute to Sir Winston Churchill, the former prime minister of Great Britain and one of the greatest leaders history has ever known. In what can only be called a lifetime of service, Churchill's contributions to the Commonwealth and to the world are without equal. During the Second World War he led the allied forces in Europe against the tyranny and fascism of Adolph Hitler and his Nazi regime. When our world was in its darkest hour, Churchill's leadership was a beacon of hope and freedom. I am reminded of something he once said, All the greatest things are simple, and many can be expressed in a single word: freedom, justice, honour, duty, mercy, hope. Sir Winston Churchill himself embodied all of these great things and will forever be a symbol of freedom, democracy and hope. Chair, I would like to add my voice to the recognition and celebration of Pride Month, which is celebrated annually during June. However, I know the ongoing pandemic will not stop us from showing our love and support for the LGBTQ+ community. To celebrate Pride Month this year, my office distributed 3,000 pride maple leaf pins across the country; whoever asked received one. Although the majority was sent to constituents in my riding, over 500 pins were sent to the neighbouring ridings of LanarkFrontenacKingston, LeedsGrenvilleThousand Islands and Rideau Lakes, and HastingsLennox and Addington. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to substitute for each other safely. grard deltell (louis-saint-laurent, cpc): Mr.Chair, I am very pleased to take part in today's meeting of this parliamentary committee. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr.Chair, I thank the hon. I agree with him that Canada and Canadians are doing an excellent and difficult job in the fight against coronavirus. As for the economy, our government is there for Canadians, for workers and for businesses, and it will continue to be. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, Canadians know that the government is there to support them. grard deltell: Canadians and Quebeckers also know that the Government of Quebec will table its economic update this week. members and to Canadians what the government is doing for the economy the chair: We return to Mr.Deltell. Chair, it is a real pleasure for me to explain to the minister and everybody in the House of Commons that today the Saskatchewan government will table its economic update. Chair, I'm delighted to have the opportunity to share with Canadians what our government is doing to support workers, businesses and the economy. We see governments acting correctly for their people, except for the Liberal government, which cannot table an economic update. When will the Liberal government table an economic update, which Canadians would like to see? the chair: The honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Chair, I am delighted to share with the member opposite and with Canadians what we are doing practically that has meaning for Canadians. Everybody is working hard in Canada, and the business community would like to know where the Liberal government is going. I've spoken about the CEBA, and let me point out that more than $26 billion of support has been given through that essential program. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, this is starting to get interesting; the minister is revealing some of these expenses. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I will continue in French by explaining what our government is doing for Canadians and workers the chair: Mr.Deltell. Chair, this is a little bit concerning for all Canadians, because this government cannot say when they will table the economic update, cannot identify how much money they have spent in the last three months and cannot say what is the deficit of Canada. christine normandin (saint-jean, bq): Mr.Chair, there are times when Quebec and the provinces are not just two solitudes, but they get along and speak as one, such as when the time comes to tell the government to mind its own business. On reading section91 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which sets out the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, nowhere do I find that the federal government must meddle by attaching conditions to health transfers. Will the government do the only thing within its authority, which is to take the cheque, sign it and put it in the mail? hon. We fully understand the importance of federal support for the provinces, especially in our national fight against the coronavirus. I would also like to point out the importance of the support of the Canadian Armed Forces, who are doing an important and excellent job in Quebec and Ontario today, right now. christine normandin: Mr.Chair, I am glad to see that there is recognition of the importance of transferring this money. My question is whether it can be transferred unconditionally; that's what I'm asking. In the past, we have seen that it takes a long time to negotiate conditions with the federal government. We saw it in the case of the Quebec City tramway, and we are still seeing it now in the case of transfers for housing in Quebec, for which there is no agreement and, therefore, no transfer of money. member said in her first question that the only thing the federal government had to do on health care was to sign the cheques. I can't agree because, today, at this time, at the request of the Premier of Quebec, the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces are in Quebec today; they're there to save the lives of seniors the chair: We now return to Ms.Normandin. What I'm saying is that, at present, the provinces are unanimously asking that there be no conditions. This is where there should be negotiations so that we can work, among other things, to send money to people living with disabilities, to make sure we fight CERB fraud and to make sure that court time limits are effective in the current crisis. Can the government focus on the issue in order to respect the provinces and transfer money for health care? hon. member that the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces are in Quebec today at the request of the Province of Quebec. member will agree with me that being there for Quebec's seniors, that saving the lives of Quebec's seniors, is much more than simply signing cheques. I think we all should thank these people who are working for Canada, for Quebec, and who are doing an important and excellent job. christine normandin: Mr.Chair, I think the Deputy Prime Minister misunderstood me when I was talking about the importance of acting quickly. Negotiations between the government and the provinces take an awfully long time because the federal government decides to place conditions where there shouldn't be any. Right now, the only important thing is to transfer the money quickly so that it can be used in our hospitals and our long-term care facilities, where the need is desperate. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I would like to point out the extent to which the federal government is there to support the provinces, including Quebec. We have increased funding to the provinces and territories by $500million to help them prepare for COVID-19 outbreaks. This funding is in addition to the $40billion that we already provide annually to the provinces and territories. Chair, I thank the member opposite for the extremely important question, and I'll take this opportunity to acknowledge the work that he has done for many years fighting racism in Canada. Chair, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister very much for the response, but there are some specific actions we need to take. When someone is in need of a wellness check or a mental health check, money, financing and support should go to mental health workers and health care workers, not the police. Chair, the member quite rightly began his questions by speaking about systemic racism against indigenous people in Canada, and I would like to speak about that for a moment. Chair, will the Liberal government commit to a review of the use of force as outlined for the RCMP? Will the Liberals commit to that change? hon. Chair, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Public Safety had many conversations last week with the RCMP. Will the Prime Minister or the Liberal government commit to something simple and ensure that at the federal level, racial profiling, street checks and carding are expressly prohibited? hon. Chair, sadly, I can't agree that rooting out systemic racism is going to be simple, but I can agree that racial profiling is absolutely inappropriate. jagmeet singh: Well, I'm going to try to get another commitment from the government, because they don't seem able to commit to something as clear as ending racial profiling. We know that millions of Canadians in a couple of weeks are going to be faced with the reality of their CERB ending. These families are worried about how they're going to put food on the table, because they can't return to a job. Will the Liberal government commit today so that those families will have some concrete support, yes or no? hon. Chair, let me be clear, as I was in my previous answer, that our government clearly is opposed to racial profiling. We know that Canadian workers, Canadian families, continue to need the chair: We'll now pause for a short time to allow staff to change within the safety parameters for the COVID-19 virus, and as we resume, we will go to Ms. Chair, the Prime Minister has mandated his ministers, and I quote, to govern in a positive, open and collaborative way. Opposition parties have little opportunity to hold the ruling party to account, private members' bills cannot be tabled and legislation cannot be debated. Trudeau himself, help us understand how all of this fits into his definition of so-called open government? the honourable pablo rodriguez (leader of the government in the house of commons): Well, Mr. Chair, we're here, right? We're here, and the opposition is asking questions. They have more time than before, so I don't know why they're not happy about it. rachael harder: That's like when I'm asking for a full meal and your handing me a few jellybeans and saying, Why aren't you happy with that? Mr. It's like switching a light on and off when it's convenient for the Prime Minister and for the Liberal Party. Trudeau do the right thing, turn the lights on and get back to work for Canadians? hon. Chair, on this side of the House, we're all actually working very hard and we're answering the questions from the opposition. On the Liberal Party website, under the platform commitment, it says that Parliament works best when its members are free to do what they have been elected to do, and that is be the voice for their communities and hold the government to account. The thing is, I think we've reached a balance whereby MPs can come from different places, mostly around Ottawa, and ask questions; but also we can have colleagues from across the country asking questions. rachael harder: Does the Prime Minister value democracy, or does he still look up to China's basic dictatorship? hon. Chair, we're answering all the questions from the opposition, not only from the people in this room, but we're answering the chair: It's back to Ms. I'd like to know from her why it is not important to her that her colleagues participate directly. Trudeau wrote to his ministers and said to them that they continue to raise the bar on openness, effectiveness and transparency. Trudeau has shut it down and has prevented us from being able to do to the good work that Canadians expect us to do. Chair, do they want to talk about shutting down Parliament? How about the time they prorogued Parliament twicenot only once, but twice? The Conservative government shut down Parliament twice. I want to remind honourable members that questions and answers are being given, and we want to hear both sides. rachael harder: In 2014, the leader of the Liberal Party developed a policy resolution entitled Restoring Trust in Canada's Democracy. At the time, the Prime Minister said, Canadians want their Members of Parliament to be effective voices for their communities in Ottawa, and not merely mouthpieces in their communities for an all-too-powerful Prime Minister. Chair, I'd like to know why my colleague wants to shut down the voices of her colleagues who could not speak and could not participate in this room. Chair, how would we vote on private members' bills, for example? As you know, it is not a government vote or a party vote; it's per row. Chair, through youthat we have electronic voting, yes or no? the chair: We'll go on to Mr. Chair, we know that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has champagne tastes and London flats, but it's his champagne mortgages that Canadians are concerned about. Specifically, why did the minister only disclose the complete extent of his personal debt to the Chinese government on June 4 of this year? hon. Chair, as you know, since the minister entered politics, his two mortgages and other liabilities and assets have been fully disclosed to the Ethics Commissioner and placed on the online public registry. We're in the middle of a pandemic here, trying to help Canadians, and the best they can do is ask questions about the chair: We will go back to Mr. garnett genuis: When the minister owes over a million dollars to the Chinese government, people have a right to ask him questions. I still don't know why they ask the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. Where is the minister? Why is he hiding? Why won't he answer questions about his personal debt to the Chinese government? hon. What is the impact on the decision-making? Three-quarters of Canadians don't want Huawei involved in our 5G network. Will the minister put the interests of Canadians ahead of the interests of his creditors and say no to Huawei? hon. We have been absolutely clear with allies and with Canadians that we never have and never will compromise Canadians' national interests. Chair, that is not an answer, and it is completely out of step with what our allies have already recognized. Reports are emerging of multiple deadly viruses exported from Winnipeg's microbiology laboratory to the Wuhan Institute of Virology right before scientists were expelled for policy breaches. In spite of that, scientific co-operation between Canadian institutions and the military-affiliated Wuhan Institute of Virology is continuing. Why hasn't the government put in place new guidelines to prevent the export of sensitive pathogens and information to China? hon. Chair, he's right that in 2019 the National Microbiology Laboratory shared lab samples with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The National Microbiology Laboratory routinely shares samples with other labs to help advance the international community's understanding of viruses and the research that is ongoing around those viruses. There are strict protocols in place for these transfers, and these samples were transported according to Canadian laws and regulations. Chair, I think Canadians would be concerned to hear that it's routine to transport viruses to Chinese military-affiliated labs. When Champagne was the parliamentary secretary for finance, the government decided to give hundreds of millions of dollars to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, bankrolling Chinese state-controlled development projects in Asia with weak standards in labour, human rights and environment. Will the minister put Canadian taxpayers ahead of his personal creditors and support a pullout from the Communist Party-controlled development bank? hon. Chair, my colleague is trying to connect the dots, and I don't know exactly where he is going from here, but everything is public. I'm sure this exchange will also be available on Google, and the public can draw their own conclusions. We have failures on 5G, failures when it comes to the transport of deadly viruses and failures when it comes to giving over $400 million to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It's time for the minister to settle his debt with the Communist government and not settle it on the backs of Canadians. michael barrett: Canada's ambassador to the United Nations sent a letter last week to all member states of the UN promising that Canada would consider providing more funding for UNRRA, the same UNRRA that is a front for Hamas, which allows weapons of terror to be stored in schools and provides textbooks that call for the destruction of Israel. Do these Liberals have no shame when it comes to their quest for a seat on the UN Security Council? hon. More than ever, Canada is playing a positive role by being a champion in diversity and inclusion, supporting the global fight against COVID-19, addressing climate change, leading peace and security efforts and helping the most vulnerable. A seat on the Security Council will allow Canada to be a strong voice for a fairer, more inclusive and prosperous the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, I received a letter from Bob Anderson this week, who's advocating for his neighbours like Jean Grevelding, who owns a cottage at Butternut Bay. Of course, our priority is and always has been and always must be the protection of the health and safety of Canadians. That's why we put in place these restrictions for non-essential travel and have required, through the Public Health Agency of Canada, a 14-day quarantine. I don't know the specifics of the person for whom you advocate, but we want to make sure that if they come into Canada, it is for an essential purpose and that they do it safely and respect the quarantine that has been put in place. michael barrett: With nine branches throughout my riding, the Royal Canadian Legion offers a great deal to veterans and rural communities alike. They have been experiencing hardship and a loss of revenue, to the point where they may be forced to shut their doors. The Zone G2 commander and local mayors such as Roger Haley have reached out to me expressing their dire need. Will the government offer support to Legions across the country so they can continue to carry out their vital work for our veterans? hon. Indeed, we're doing everything we can to make sure that we help the Legions and other groups that do so much to help veterans right across the country. michael barrett: On May 21, the minister stated that her team was working as quickly as it could to fill the gaps in CEBA. It has now been three weeks, and many business owners, such as mortgage broker Corinna Smith-Gatcke, are still left in the lurch amid the delays, which are pushing businesses closer to shutting their doors for good. Those businesses can absolutely have access to the loan at their financial institution this Friday, and I would encourage them to go and see their bank or credit union. I want businesses to know that nothing is more important for us than making sure they get the support they need during this difficult time. michael barrett: The County Road 43 expansion project is critical for my riding and the region as a whole. This project will widen the road, increasing safety for the 18,000 motorists who travel the road every day. It's been 334 days since the provincial and local governments announced funding, but there has been nothing from this Liberal government. Today, there is still nothing, and for the last month the minister's team has not even found the time to respond to my request for an update. We're always happy to work with members of Parliament, but they must also work with provinces and territories so that projects are advanced by them to our office. MacAulay read ombudsman Dalton's May 2020 report, Financial Compensation for Canadian Veterans: A comparative analysis of benefit regimes? hon. Wagantall, we'll freeze the time so that there's no extra time taken. MacAulay has read ombudsman Dalton's May 2020 report, Financial Compensation for Canadian Veterans: A comparative analysis of benefit regimes. I've done everything and worked with him in order to make sure that we bring the proper compensation to veterans the chair: We'll go back to Mrs. cathay wagantall: As a result of that study, are the financial outcomes Canada seeks to provide for ill and injured veterans now clearly defined within the Department of Veterans Affairs? hon. Chair, as the member would know, I am to bring a report to the veterans affairs committee, and there are a number of things done in order to make sure that report is the chair: We'll go back to Mrs. cathay wagantall: Then I would suggest that we get our committee up and going as it should be. lawrence macaulay: Well, of course, lockdown, but just under $90 million that the government put in supplementary estimates to make sure we address the backlog for Veterans Affairs. cathay wagantall: Minister, are Canadian Armed Forces members provided with a copy of this document? hon. In Ombudsman Dalton's recent report, did any one of these three provide the best compensation in all nine scenarios that were studied? hon. lawrence macaulay: Of course, as she knows, there's been a lot of work done in order to make sure that we provide the proper compensation to veterans. cathay wagantall: In the undisclosed settlement of Sean Bruyea's legal case against Seamus O'Regan and the Liberal government, a joint statement says ...Canadians, especially all Veterans and their families, are encouraged to enter the public debate about policies and programs that affect our Veterans and their families. lawrence macaulay: I can assure you that anybody is welcome to enter any discussion on compensation of veterans. We're always open to what we can do in order to make sure that we provide appropriate compensation. I don't think the term would be appropriate, but it would provide some compensation to veterans who truly deserve it.  Ms.Larouche, did I understand correctly that the interpretation didn't work for both speakers? ms. andranne larouche: The sound didn't allow the interpreters to do their job. the chair: In that case, I would ask both members to maybe put their mike a little bit close to their mouth. cathay wagantall: On a point of order, quite often while I'm trying to speak, there are lots of other voices in the background. the chair: I would ask everyone to please be on mute, as well as for anyone in the chamber to please refrain from speaking loudly. cathay wagantall: You said next question, so we're not going backwards, Chair? the chair: Did we have an answer from Minister MacAulay? No? We'll go to Minister MacAulay to finish up the answer. Then, because of all of the confusion, we'll start at one minute and 45 seconds when we get going again. cathay wagantall: Should I repeat the question, sir? the chair: Please do. In the undisclosed settlement to Sean Bruyea's legal case against Seamus O'Regan and the Liberal government, a joint statement says, Canadians, especially all Veterans and their families, are encouraged to enter the public debate about policies and programs that affect our Veterans and their families. Anybody is quite open to indicate whatever they wish in order to make sure we provide as appropriate a compensation as possible. You can never totally compensate veterans truly for what they deserve, but we want to make sure we provide the best compensation possible. cathay wagantall: If that's the case, is Minister MacAulay aware of the practice of red-flagging veterans' files? hon. cathay wagantall: Since the deputy minister has indicated that he runs the department, will the minister ask him for the names of veterans and the dates and the reasons that they are, or have been, red-flagged by VAC? hon. I will do anything I can to make sure that the veterans the chair: We'll go back to Ms. cathay wagantall: Do the most ill and injured still receive from the pension up to $300,000 less for life? hon. Chair, as you know and as the Prime Minister indicated when the pension for life was put in place, it was stated that if anybody receives lessthe Prime Minister himself indicated it quite clearlythat must be adjusted. cathay wagantall: For veterans in similar circumstances, should the date of their application for compensation be a factor in determining whether they're treated equitably? hon. Retired Major Mark Campbell in my riding of Sturgeon RiverParkland lost both legs in the line of duty in Afghanistan. He is an avid sport shooter, but understandably, due to his disability, he is very limited in the kinds of firearms he can use, and all of these firearms have now been banned under the Liberal OIC. My question to the Minister of Public Safety is this: Did their department do a legal analysis and consider the section 15 charter rights of disabled Canadians not to be discriminated against when they passed their OIC? hon. bill blair: Yes, there was a very thorough analysis done by the justice department to ensure that the prohibitions we put in place were, in fact, charter compliant. We have prohibited them, and we believeand this has been echoed by many people across the countrythat this will make Canadians safer. Chair, is the minister aware that the AR-15 is the most popular sporting rifle in Canada, and is he aware that disabled veterans like Major Mark Campbell are unable to participate in the sport of sport shooting because of his OIC? hon. bill blair: I can assure the member that what I am aware of is that the AR-15 and other weapons like them have been used in mass killings in Canada on many occasions, such as at cole Polytechnique, at Dawson College, again at the Quebec mosque and in Moncton. The AR-15s in particular were also used at the terrible tragedy in places like Sandy Hook, where a bunch of kids were killed, so there is no place for the chair: We will go to Mr. Chair, it has been months since the Liberals shut down this Parliament and months since the Minister of Finance should have presented a budget or at least an economic update to Canadians. Well, that didn't stop Stephen Harper and the Conservatives from tabling a budget in the depth of the last great recession. We're working for Canadians and bringing forward supports to make sure that businesses, workers and Canadians can put food on the table and pay their rent. We will continue to support Canadians, and when we have a clear projection to present, we will do that. Chair, the results are in, and businesses aren't happy with the so-called support programs from these Liberals. When is the government going to recognize that their business support plans have been an absolute failure with only a fraction of the billions promised being accessible to businesses? hon. We had the BCAP, which is critically important to providing liquidity to support the SMEs that make up 85% of the jobs in our sector. We are helping hard-working Canadians, small businesses and large businesses right across the country, but in particular in our energy sector. He tweeted recently to praise the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line and the North West Redwater Partnership refinery in my riding. Can the minister tell us what, if any, support they have given to the innovative carbon capture and sequestration technology in this country? hon. Chair, we see carbon capture and sequestration as an integral part of lowering emissions, making emissions more competitive and making our oil and gas industry more competitive. dane lloyd: I note that the minister couldn't name a single example of government support for carbon capture, utilization and sequestration technology. We have spent a lot of time talking about the COVID-19 pandemic, but Canadians are living with another horrific reality, that being the intensifying opioid overdose epidemic. Reports indicate that in the past four years, 14,000 Canadians have died, and the numbers during COVID-19 have been skyrocketing, with British Columbia seeing a 39% increase this year alone. When is the government going to take this scourge seriously and take action to save the lives of Canadians? hon. Chair, I share the member's deep sadness about the number of lives we've lost to opioid overdose. Our government has been steadily making it easier for people who live with substance use to access medications to treat substance use, such as prescription Suboxone and methadone. We have made it easier to rapidly establish safe injection sites in communities and have supported community-based projects that work with people who are using substances. We need to understand that this is a complex issue, and we need to support people to get the help they need. carol hughes (algomamanitoulinkapuskasing, ndp)): The hon. louise chabot (thrse-de blainville, bq): MadamChair, I will come back to the bill introduced last week. As parliamentarians, we felt like we were watching a very bad play, as I imagine the public did. However, the government did not see fit to negotiate with the opposition parties, even though it is in a minority position. One of the things we proposed was to split the bill so that we could give this support to people with disabilities, but the Conservatives did not want to do that. We came back and asked for time to negotiate and give support to people with disabilities, but the government defeated the motion. We asked that the House be recalled today so that we could pass this part of the bill concerning support for people with disabilities, but we are still in the dark. We know this pandemic has deeply affected the lives and health of all Canadians and has disproportionately affected Canadians with disabilities in particular. From the very beginning, we've taken a disability-inclusive approach to our emergency response to ensure that Canadians with disabilities get the support they need. That is why we announced a one-time payment of $600 for persons with disabilities to address these expenses. We're confident that this measure, along with other investments, will benefit Canadians with disabilities, and we hope to get the support of the other parties very soon. louise chabot: MadamChair, I remind you that this measure wasn't passed because we weren't allowed to do so. We've tried here, in the House, to provide the means to give that support, so I ask again, can the government be counted on to give a response to people with disabilities? hon. It contained assistance for the disabled, of course, but it also contained assistance for our seasonal workers, as well as a number of other measures that the Bloc Qubcois opposed. They refused to debate and, when the question of splitting the bill came up, the Conservatives refused to do that. This bill proposed changes to the wage subsidy program, it was supposed to make the CERB more flexible, it proposed fines for fraudsters and, since there was a little section about a benefit for the disabled, the government took it for granted that we would support it without any negotiations with the parties. However, we set one very important condition: that the Liberal Party must get its hands out of taxpayers' pockets in terms of the wage subsidy. pablo rodriguez: MadamChair, as we listen to the Bloc Qubcois members, we might think that they invented peanut butter and apple pie. This bill contained a number of measures that all Quebeckers and all Canadians needed, but the Bloc Qubcois refused to debate it. No, we did not follow the Bloc Qubcois' example in splitting the bill; we had thought of it a long time previously. louise chabot: We asked on a number of occasions for the House to be able to sit starting today to pass the part of the bill dealing with those with disabilities. pablo rodriguez: MadamChair, my colleague knows very well that things are not as simple as that. I hope that, one day, we will be able to pass this bill and be able to provide assistance for those living with disabilities. yasmin ratansi (don valley east, lib.): Thank you, Madam Chair. Several measures have been implemented for phasing out coal, making polluters pay, providing climate incentives, investing in green technologies and much more, which all together have created a climate plan that is doing more to cut pollution than any other in Canada's history. One area of particular interest is our government's work to protect 25% of Canada's land and 25% of its oceans by 2025. Could the minister update this House on the new conservation projects announced on June 5, World Environment Day, and on how our government is protecting our environment? hon. seamus o'regan: Madam Chair, protecting nature is an important part of how we will address climate change and the very real challenges it presents. That's why on June 5, World Environment Day, our government announced over 60 conservation projects under development across Canada. They'll conserve Canadian nature and biodiversity and protect species at risk, enhance ecological integrity and connectivity, and enhance the size of Canada's vast network of protected areas. Nearly half of these projects are indigenous-led, with the aim of creating indigenous-protected conserved areas. Madam Chair, projects like these move us closer to our goal of protecting 25% of Canada's lands and oceans by 2025. By working together in partnership with the provinces, territories, municipalities, indigenous peoples and Canadians, together we can protect our natural environment for generations to come. Ratansi, since you have 25 seconds left, we will go to the honourable member for Surrey Centre. randeep sarai (surrey centre, lib.): Madam Chair, there are many small and medium-sized businesses in my riding of Surrey Centre. They saw a decrease in business or needed to close their doors completely in order to adhere to public safety measures to manage the spread of COVID-19. These measures helped keep our most vulnerable citizens safe and ensured that our hospital and health care providers did not become overwhelmed with a sharp spike in cases. Thanks to our government's COVID-19 emergency response, many of these businesses have been able to keep their employees and access important liquidity through the Canada emergency business account, which provides loans to small businesses and non-profits, and the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which is helping businesses to keep and rehire their employees while their revenues are down by providing up to 75% of wages for up to 24 weeks. As we begin to reopen the economy and Canadians across the country return to the job market, those benefits will be even more important to help businesses and industries rehire their staff and make important adjustments to align with public health guidelines to gradually increase their operations. Can the minister please update the committee on how many Canadian businesses have taken advantage of CEBA and CEWS since applications for each have been opened? hon. mary ng: Madam Chair, I want to begin by thanking the member for Surrey Centre for all the work he does to support his constituents and small businesses. Canadians across the country need to know our government has been working tirelessly and will continue to work tirelessly on their behalf. This is why we put in place the important programs to help them get through this crisis during this difficult time, programs such as the wage subsidy program. The wage subsidy has helped these businesses keep their employees on the payroll and are now helping in their rehiring as they slowly and safely restart. There are 348,000 businesses being helped with the wage subsidy program, and this means that 2.6 million workers are being helped. Businesses are also being helped through the interest-free $40,000 loan they can access through CEBA to help stay afloat and pay their expenses during this crisis. I'm pleased to inform this House that to date more than 669,000 the acting chair (mrs. Madam Chair, with so many recent reports and videos of police using force, sometimes deadly force, and violence against indigenous and black people in Canada, I've called for the public safety committee to reconvene. If the members agree, will the minister come to the committee and provide concrete answers as to how the government intends to address racism inherent in Canada's law enforcement, and in particular the RCMP? hon. Madam Chair, indigenous people, black Canadians and other racialized people are far too often experiencing systemic racism and disparate outcomes within the entire criminal justice system. In order to respond appropriately, I think it's necessary to begin by acknowledging the lived experience of people who've known bias and discrimination at the hands of the police and our courts and within our prisons. We remain committed to working with all racialized people and all of the members of this House to ensure that we work toward social justice for all Canadians, and I look forward to discussing the member's motion further with him. jack harris: Will the minister and the government commit to facilitating such a meeting of this committee virtually? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, the decisions of the committee are the committee's, so I'm sure that this will be a discussion within the committee, but if called, I will certainly be pleased to come with my officials to provide the committee with whatever support and information it needs to contribute to this very important discussion. jack harris: In light of what we've seen with Chief Adam in Fort McMurray and the RCMP accepting that the actions were reasonable, will the minister commit to a full review of the use of force by the RCMP, in particular the philosophy, tactics and training that is given to RCMP officers in dealing with the public? hon. bill blair: I thank the member and I want to assure him, first of all, that this is work that is ongoing, not just in the RCMP but throughout the police community. May I also take this opportunity, Madam Chair, to say that I think all police training has to begin with one very important principle, and that's the preservation of all life and the respect for all Canadians. We're committed to continuing to work with indigenous communities, racialized communities and with police services and all participants in the criminal justice system to make sure that it is fair for all Canadians. lindsay mathyssen (londonfanshawe, ndp): Madam Chair, we need more justice for black, indigenous and racialized people in Canada. This government recognizes that systemic racism exists but refuses to collect race-based data that would allow us to quantify and truly address this injustice. bardish chagger (minister of diversity and inclusion and youth): Madam Chair, our government agrees that it's important that we collect data, and that's exactly why, in the anti-racism secretariat and the anti-racism strategy, there is a commitment to have money go to Statistics Canada to collect race-based data. lindsay mathyssen: Madam Chair, we know that Statistics Canada will start to collect job numbers based on race. This will allow us to identify systemic racism where it is and where we need to ensure a fair and more equal job market for black, indigenous and racialized people in Canada. Why is this government refusing to follow suit so we can tackle systemic racism everywhere, in every sector? hon. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I'd like to thank my honourable colleague for her question. She's absolutely correct in her assessment that we need to collect more data, reliable data, data that will help us deal with some of the challenges we're seeing with systemic discrimination, but, more broadly, we want to make sure that we continue to engage with an anti-racism strategy that will allow us to collect that disaggregated data. That is why we allocated $6.2 million to that initiative through Statistics Canada, but we know we must do more and we will do more. lindsay mathyssen: We know that all people are susceptible to catching COVID-19, but health authorities are clear that parts of cities like Montreal and Toronto have been more impacted than others. For black and racialized people living in these cities, this data is a matter of life and death. Will the government collect and share disaggregated data so we can identify and erase systemic racism, yes or no? hon. bardish chagger: Madam Chair, making decisions based on science and evidence is essential for our government. It is exactly the step we will take moving forward and that's why we are making those investments to ensure that data exists. I look forward to continuing to work not only with all ministers, departments and agencies, but all allies and all parties to get this work done. carol hughes): Mr.Blaney, the honourable member for BellechasseLes EtcheminsLvis, has the floor. steven blaney (bellechasseles etcheminslvis, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. Last week, my plumber told me that, each time Justin Trudeau comes down the steps to make announcements totalling several billion dollars, he feels like someone is rifling through his pockets. My question is simple and goes to the Minister of Finance: where is this money coming from? hon. steven blaney: The answer I would have liked is simple: we are borrowing the money and we are going to have to pay it back one day. That is another Liberal craze: they borrow money, they make campaign promises, and off they go. Under the Conservative government, the Chantier Davie in Lvis had 1,700workers for the supply ship Asterix. david lametti (minister of justice and attorney general of canada): MadamChair, we are very proud of the Chantier Davie and we completely understand its role in the system. We are going to establish the process for the polar ice-breaker, which is essential for the work of the Coast Guard in northern communities, and we are going to make sure that the acting chair (mrs. There is money in the Canada summer jobs program: in my constituency alone, $150,000has been approved. What is the minister waiting for in order to confirm those positions? In my constituency, and everywhere else in the country, our young people want to work. What is the government waiting for in order to send some cash to the Canada summer jobs program? hon. We are introducing flexibilities into the system to enable employers to be able to hire summer students. The money is available; where is the announcement? MadamChair, our young people are not the only ones who want to work. Let me use Jessie Gito as an example; he has been working at Plate2000 in Saint-Anselme for years. When the time came to renew his work permit, he found out that he has to have some biometric tests. Is the minister going to allow Jessie Gito and the thousands of other temporary foreign workers who want to work to be able to do so until the government biometric testing centres reopen? hon. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, it is important for the honourable member to recognize that we are in the early recovery stage of the pandemic. We will ensure that we support both our students and our temporary foreign workers to make sure we get the recovery right. We've introduced flexibilities into the program to ensure that employers are able to take advantage of the program and give opportunities to young people. Then, when the government's biometric testing centres are open again, he will gladly go to one. Young people want to work in agriculture as well, and the minister has told us that the government wants young people working and that their files will be processed as quickly as possible. She wants to create 700positions and she knows that people can fill in an application on a first-come first-served basis. Of those 700positions, how many have been confirmed to date? The good weather has arrived, the corn is starting to grow, and this is the time when farmers need the young workers. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): MadamChair, the program for young workers in agriculture is open. This is a program that is not only intended to provide summer jobs, but also to interest young people in making a career in agriculture. doug shipley (barriespringwateroro-medonte, cpc): Thank you, Chair. Over the course of the pandemic, has the government been using all avenues possible to source much-needed PPE in Canada? hon. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, we have been very clear that we have a made-in-Canada initiative that has engaged companies across the country. Over 700 companies have retooled and scaled up their operations for personal protective equipment to help front-line health care workers. doug shipley: Madam Chair, I need to ask very quickly which ministry and minister are responsible for the sourcing of PPE in Canada. I work with the Minister of Health and the minister for procurement , and we coordinate with the provinces and territories to make sure there are appropriate levels of PPE to help front-line health care workers and essential workers across the country. For over 37 years, it has provided front-line health care workers with an extensive line of PPE and other essential products required when dealing with respiratory illnesses. Southmedic currently employs over 700 people, and it has been recognized as one of Canada's best-managed companies by Deloitte on numerous occasions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, both I and the member for BarrieInnisfil have been attempting to obtain some assistance for Southmedic from the federal government. I received a letter back from the minister dated May 27 indicating that this issue of Southmedic falls under the mandate of the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. When will the federal government reach out and help this great Canadian company and therefore ensure that all front-line workers will have the proper PPE they require? hon. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I'd like to thank my honourable colleague for his question. Since then, we've seen over 6,000 companies step up to offer solutions and ideas, and over 700 companies have retooled their efforts. I acknowledge that some companies are still engaging with the government, and we'll continue to explore all possible options to make sure we continue to procure the necessary levels of personal protective equipment to protect Canadians and to protect front-line health care workers. Moving on to a different issue, while walking to my office this morning, I stopped at my local small family-run coffee shop and was discussing the current economic situation with the two owners of the establishment. The only thing keeping them hopeful is that soon the public service will start returning to work, and therefore their business will begin to return. Could the government please give us some indication as to what the plans are for returning the civil service back to work safely, and when? hon. This is a very important topic, but I'd like to take the opportunity first to thank our public servants, who have worked very hard in the last few weeks, both personally and professionally. In fact, today is a wonderful day to say that, because today is the start of National Public Service Week. They've been at work for the last few monthsin different circumstances, but they have been working very hard to deliver the services and the support Canadians need and deserve. carol hughes): Next we'll go to the honourable member for SelkirkInterlakeEastman, Mr. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): Thank you, Madam Chair. First of all, I want to thank the great men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces for the fantastic job they're doing in Operation LASER, serving on the front lines battling COVID-19. Can the Minister of National Defence give the House an update on exactly where we are at with the number of Canadian Armed Forces members who have been infected with COVID-19? hon. sajjan (minister of national defence): Madam Chair, I want to echo the member opposite's comments in thanking our Canadian Armed Forces members. Currently, we have 13 active cases in the Canadian Armed Forces, but in the long-term care facilities we currently have 50 cases. james bezan: Through you, Chair, Minister Sajjan, does that number of active cases include the active cases that are in long-term care facilities right now in Operation LASER? hon. sajjan: Madam Chair, as I stated, the 50 cases are strictly from the long-term care facilities. Sajjan say how many of those cases in long-term care facilities are active and how many are recovered? hon. What I can say to break it down further is that in Quebec we currently have 36 and in Ontario we have 14. The President of the Treasury Board has said, The Canadian Armed Forces will be present as long as their presence is needed in Quebec. This contradicts what Prime Minister Trudeau is saying, which is that we have a hard deadline of June 26 for the withdrawal of our troops for Operation LASER. We've been in very extensive discussions with the Province of Quebec, with my counterpart Minister Guilbault, and we are working very diligently to ensure we have a sustained, appropriate response to the request from Quebec for assistance. That response will result in a transition from the currently deployed Canadian Armed Forces to the deployment of paid volunteers, trained personnel who will take on the important role of providing services to those Canadians who need our help in Quebec. The Department of National Defence auditors have called out the Liberal government for mismanagement over the $553-billion investment in our Canadian military through the defence policy. This is a $553-billion investment in our armed forces, and only three people are managing it. Could the minister tell us how that is even possible? Is this the reason that over 100 projects are currently behind schedule? hon. sajjan: Madam Chair, first of all, I want to highlight the unprecedented investment that we're making in defence. When it comes to the management of this, it's conducted by me and the minister of procurement . Are we going to see more cuts because you have been unable to actually roll out these dollars? hon. carol hughes): Before I go to the next speaker, I want to remind members that they are to address their questions and comments directly through the chair. david yurdiga (fort mcmurraycold lake, cpc): Madam Chair, the Canada summer jobs program has many challenges. I've seen many indigenous communities in my riding rejected for funding even though they had received funding in previous years. Here are a few examples of communities that were rejected: Beaver Lake Cree Nation, Buffalo Lake Mtis Settlement and the Mtis Nation of Alberta, Region 1. Could the Prime Minister explain why so many indigenous communities have been denied funding from the Canada summer jobs program? hon. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, we recognize the important role that the Canada summer jobs program plays in supporting employers and young workers in our community across the country every year. We're working very hard to help employers adapt to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic and are supporting young Canadians as they begin to look for summer employment. We are introducing increased flexibilities into the Canada summer jobs program to hire youth, while also providing more supports to employers that deliver essential services to Canadians. Why are so many indigenous communities left out of the Canada summer jobs program? This is very important to my community and to communities throughout the province. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we, of course, value the important role that the Canada summer jobs program plays in all communities, including indigenous communities in Canada. I will certainly have an off-line conversation with the honourable member, if he so wishes, about a particular issue, but I can assure him that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had to assist employers to introduce flexibilities the acting chair (mrs. david yurdiga: Madam Chair, in my riding, the City of Cold Lake has been in dispute with the federal government for many years over payment in lieu of taxes. Could the Minister of Public Services and Procurement give me a rough estimate of when I will receive a response from the minister's office to my first letter, from 2017, and my letters from 2018, 2019 and 2020? hon. david lametti: Madam Chair, I can assure the honourable member that I will go to the minister, and we will come back with an answer to his question. david yurdiga: How much longer does the minister intend to perpetuate the ongoing PILT dispute, which is in excess of $11 million, with the City of Cold Lake? hon. david lametti: Madam Chair, once again, I can assure the honourable member that I will speak with the minister and get an answer to his question. david yurdiga: Well, do you know what? I've been writing letters to the department for many years. When you say you're going to get back to me, I really have a hard time believing that. Will the minister agree to follow the prior recommendations of the dispute advisory panel that were accepted by the minister? hon. david lametti: Madam Chair, I can assure the honourable member that I will check with the minister and that she will return to the member in due course. david yurdiga: Madam Chair, the drug Trikafta has been proven to increase the quality of life for 90% of cystic fibrosis patients. Two weeks ago, my office sent a letter to the Minister of Health about the boy in my riding named Cael, who through the special access program is able to get Trikafta in Canada. I requested that the minister use her powers to fast-track Trikafta for commercial use, but I have yet to receive a response back. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, I'm glad to hear that Cael was able to access Trikafta through the special access program. In fact, that program is very helpful for people who are seeking access to medication that's not currently marketed in Canada. As the member opposite knows, Vertex has not applied to market Trikafta in Canada, but we look forward to their application, and I encourage him to write a letter to the manufacturer to also encourage them. I was very troubled to hear that a CBC radio host in the Yukon felt compelled to resign because, as an indigenous person, she could not speak her truth. While we know the Broadcasting Act states that the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature of Canadian society and the special place of indigenous peoples, it would seem there are some challenges. Therefore, does the Minister of Heritage share the concern of some journalists that problems of systemic racism in Canada are still existing within the institution of the CBC, and will the government now acknowledge the need to recognize the jurisdiction of indigenous governments? hon. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Thank you, Madame Chair; and I thank the member for this important question. As stated by the Prime Minister on numerous occasions, our government recognizes that systemic racism exists in Canada, and we have made a commitment to do everything we can to combat it in whichever organization of the Canadian government. I understand these issues to be ones that challenge societal norms, that are not politically expedient to address because they can lose you votes, even though addressing them is morally right and a smart thing to do. In the justice system, examples include mandatory minimum penalties, defunding police, and even investing in restorative justice. Surely now these issues are politically less of a consideration than the tragic reality of even more slain indigenous Canadians at the hands of police, or thousands of indigenous people still incarcerated or living in poverty. Will this government please finally commit to the necessary work originally promised in 2015 and repeal in the justice system the vast majority of mandatory minimum penalties, assuring the necessary discretion for judges, and meaningfully invest in restorative justice measures? hon. david lametti: Madame Chair, I thank the honourable member for her question, as well as for her work as Minister of Justice, and indeed my predecessor. This is a time when we recognize systemic over-incarceration of indigenous peoples, of black peoples, in our criminal justice system. This is a time when we need to look at all potential options to reduce what is a shameful overrepresentation in our criminal justice system. Too often racialized peoples and indigenous peoples have experienced prejudice and systemic discrimination in our justice system, and that has to change. Many of the deaths are related to COVID-19 measures that have prevented people from accessing supervised consumption sites, so they are overdosing alone. While the provinces welcomed the federal backing of safe supply exemption back in March, it is to expire in September of 2020. Will the government provide the necessary supports to the province and help support safe supply initiatives in the provinces? hon. patty hajdu: It's been a pleasure to work with the Province of British Columbia on innovative ways to work on the tragic situation of opioid overdose. I remain committed to working with the province and in fact any province that wants to work towards solutions that treat people who use substances with the dignity they deserve. We're working closely with our partners to make sure that we can prevent more lives from being lost. carol hughes): We will go to the honourable member for South OkanaganWest Kootenay, Mr. richard cannings (south okanaganwest kootenay, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. They've been serving great food for 40 years, but now they're struggling, because they don't qualify for the emergency wage subsidy. The new owner can't use a year-to-year comparison to apply for the wage subsidy because he didn't own the restaurant last spring. He is forced to use receipts from January and February, the darkest doldrums of the restaurant year, to compare with the results from May, traditionally one of their best months. When will the government fix this inequity and let Theo's compete and survive? hon. mona fortier: Madam Chair, the Canada emergency wage subsidy is supporting over 2.5 million workers across the country. To help even more businesses support their workers and rehire people as they reopen, our government is extending the CEWS, and we will continue to extend the CEWS for an additional 12 weeks to August 29 to ensure that Canadian workers continue to have the support they need during these very difficult times. By extending eligibility, our government is ensuring that more Canadian workers in more sectors have the support they need. richard cannings: The owner just wants to be able to apply for the wage subsidy, and right now he cannot, and he will not be able to. Canada's forest sector has been declared essential during this pandemic, but it's been hit hard after a very difficult 2019. Despite soft markets and thousands out of work, government support programs have left many Canadian forest product companies behind. In my riding, the pulp mill in Castlegar is closing for the month of July because local sawmills aren't producing enough wood chips. What is the government going to do to finally support Canadian forestry workers and communities? the acting chair (mrs. carol hughes): The time is almost up, but I will allow for the answer from the honourable minister. In fact, in Quebec, partnering with Les Bois Francs DV Inc., we have widened market access to our products and updated technology systems. In Vancouver we're working with FPInnovations to create the indigenous forest sector technical support program. carol hughes): Now we go to the honourable member for SkeenaBulkley Valley, Mr. taylor bachrach (skeenabulkley valley, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to pick up where my colleague left off, with B.C.'s forest industry. are multiple rounds of mill shutdowns and start-ups, and in some cases this has made it difficult for forestry workers to qualify for EI. My question to the minister is this: Will the minister work to make the EI program more flexible for forestry workers, similar to what this government has done for oil and gas workers? hon. That has been key in the inactive and orphan well program, which we are working on with the provincial governments of Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Alberta. The focus on workers has assured that success, and we will continue to focus on workers in all the industries, particularly our natural resource industry, as they go through this extraordinarily difficult time. taylor bachrach: Madam Chair, reforestation is a very important part of the forest industry in the riding I represent, and people were keenly interested to hear this government's plan to plant two billion trees in the next 10 years. I'm wondering if the minister could tell us how many trees are going to be planted under this program by the end of this season. We are working with forestry associations, the industry and with individual companies to ensure this tree-planting season will be one of the largest the country has ever seen. rhal fortin (rivire-du-nord, bq): MadamChair, last week, the government introduced BillC-17 and the Minister of Justice sent us briefing notes in which he said that it was important to suspend a number of time limits and to extend others, and that the failure to do so could have important repercussions on Canadians, their families, their situations, their finances and their ability to exercise their rights. We have addressed the mandatory time limits in federal legislation as well as certain time limits that courts may not be able to handle. The minister's briefing notes say that, among other things, when it comes to divorcewhich means children are involved people are waiting on custody rights, child support and visitation rights. The minister pointed out that the national security review would require consultations if no decision is made in the prescribed time frame. rhal fortin: MadamChair, what a coincidence, because I beseech my colleague opposite to debate it with us. Last week, the leader of the Bloc Qubcois asked the Liberal government to debate BillC-17 today. Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who is hardly a dimwit or greenhorn, told us that the justice system needs to be modernized. As recently as this past Saturday in LaPresse, Justice Wagner said that it is essential that the Criminal Code be amended to address the backlog of court proceedings. When will the Liberal government opposite pull up its socks, do its job, govern the federation, sit down with the opposition and discuss the vital matters in BillC-17? hon. pablo rodriguez: MadamChair, if I were my colleague, I would be a little embarrassed, because the bill was sent to the Bloc Qubcois several days in advance. When we asked for the support of the Bloc Qubcois and the other parties to debate itwe were not even asking them to vote in favour of the billthey refused. For example, we asked the Liberals to put the money back into the wage subsidy fund and to commit to dip into it no longer. pablo rodriguez: Can my colleague explain to me what the emergency wage subsidy has to do with a bill about justice? This is an absolutely fundamental piece of legislation. rhal fortin: MadamChair, I would like nothing better than to explain it to him, but I must remind him that he is the leader of the party in power, the party that is supposed to govern the country. I am thinking of families, child support, child custody, labour law disputes in Federal Court, marine transportation, interprovincial transportation, aviation, banks, and those with grievances waiting for a Federal Court ruling. The whole system, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, everything is on hold because nobody in the government wants to do their job. However, when we asked the Bloc Qubcois if they wanted to debate the bill, they said no, instead of doing what they usually do and saying yes. When the CERB runs out, many workers in my riding of Essex will not have sufficient hours to collect their EI benefits. Because of the shutdown, a mom-to-be who had just returned to work in January, and several hundred of her fellow employees, may not have the 600 hours required for regular or EI parental benefits. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, the Canada emergency response benefit has been providing much-needed help to Canadian workers across the country who have stopped working due to COVID-19. We know that there is still a lot of uncertainty for many Canadian workers, and we know that many will be exhausting their benefits in the weeks to come. We will have more to share soon, as early as this week, on our continuing efforts to support Canadian workers and make sure that help is available during this the acting chair (mrs. We will continue to make sure that we make the necessary investments in the EI delivery system and modernize it to continue to meet the acting chair (mrs. mary ng: Madam Chair, today we are seeing small businesses that have been helped, whether it is getting access to the small business loan, which some are also using in the restart as they are safely restarting, or getting help with their payroll, helping them keep their employees the acting chair (mrs. How will the government incentivize workers to return to their jobs when recalled? the acting chair (mrs. mary ng: The Canada emergency wage subsidy is an excellent program to help those employees stay employed and for those employers who are looking at rehiring them right now during this restart process. chris lewis: Madam Chair, many of my constituents are in a committed cross-border relationship and have not been able to see their partners in quite some time. bill blair: Madam Chair, as we said from the outset, we've implemented restrictions at the U.S. border on non-essential travel with a single purpose in mind: to protect the health and safety of Canadians. As the member is aware, just last week we introduced new measures that allow people in family relationships to stay together as long as they commit to the necessary 14-day period of quarantine. chris lewis: Madam Chair, with regard to child care, as our economy continues to open, parents are facing a stark choice: Who will care for their children? What's the plan to provide access to child care so parents can confidently return to work? hon. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, we are of course committed to continuing to make the record investments that we've been making in child care. We're committed to creating an additional 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces. It sounds as though this government has a desire to force parents to choose between their job and care for their child"

        "Query": "What were the team's decisions and solutions regarding the remote control's visibility, ease of finding, and prevention of loss during the discussion of technical issues, market interests, and the function of \"glow in the dark\"?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed various options for the remote control design. User Interface suggested a base station next to the TV, but it was deemed technically complicated and costly. Marketing proposed implementing an audio signal, which was ultimately adopted. There were debates about where to place the logo on the remote. Project Manager suggested printing it on a button, but User Interface was concerned about wear and tear. Industrial Designer suggested putting it on the back, but visibility was an issue. User Interface proposed a two-piece remote, but it didn't align with the cover design. Finally, it was agreed to leave a cut-out space on the latex covers to display the logo. The team decided on a beeping feature for when the remote gets lost and a fixed charger to prevent loss. Marketing suggested additional features like beeping or blinking lights when clapping, and a signal when in a dark spot. However, voice and clapping were deemed insufficient, and the team settled on glow-in-the-dark material combined with speech recognition for easy location. This choice was cost-effective and believed to boost market sales.",

Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Summary": "The market research conducted by the Marketing department suggested that the ideal design for the remote should be spongy and resemble a fruit or vegetable. After considering options like banana, apple, and pear, the banana was chosen due to its appealing color and recognizable shape. The Marketing team believed that the current trend of incorporating fruits and vegetables into fashion in Milan and Paris indicated that a remote with a similar style would be both fashionable and technologically innovative. They also considered the pear as a potential shape for the remote, as it is easy to hold and preferred a spongy material for its durability. The Project Manager supported the use of spongy material and prioritized the inclusion of a wheel, as it would set their remote apart from competitors. Additionally, the Project Manager agreed that the banana would be a suitable choice due to its ease of identification.",
        "Article": "project manager: Hello ,  this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . project manager:  the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but  in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . So ,  we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and  I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .  so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from  looking at   some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world .  the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan .  so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel ,  as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .  and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the  is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan ,  we've discovered that this year  fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . marketing:  so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy ,  has lots of technolog tech technology in it . user interface: marketing: And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . marketing: So  fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , project manager: Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think  I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it  later .  generally , generally  this remote control   should be should be something , in my opinion ,  the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position   inside the remote control . And  s  I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and  start reading and  learning how to use this  this  remote control . So what I found out that  as I said  I think it's better to put  more frequent    ke  buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . user interface: And maybe  just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And  also f   m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not  consume lots of energy . And my personal p  preference is  , as I said ,  just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used  that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or  number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put  volume change or s ch can  channel change buttons   in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task  he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . And also  I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . For example , a sliding or rolling   d  stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with  thumb . And  I dunno but  I think usage of a speech recogn  r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . industrial designer:  okay , so good news from me   for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as marketing: project manager: industrial designer: Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but project manager: This one , yeah . This this is just  one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just  I just found this , that our company  developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just marketing: Inch . industrial designer: Yeah , seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . industrial designer: Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .  first thing is  this will be the overall shape , no  I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device .  the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can   And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can  supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just  two batteries and solar cells , so .  the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is  seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . Then the graphical card  for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can  we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches .  I have to check what I wanted to  from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des  ov all the device . project manager: Can you fit any  for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . industrial designer: A all these things in in  in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , project manager: Okay . user interface: Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . marketing: This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: how big is it in reality ? industrial designer: Well , seven to seven inches . industrial designer: marketing:   have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? project manager: No , I don't think it's seven by seven , industrial designer: Yeah but project manager: I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . industrial designer: To be honest , I was project manager: Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . industrial designer: Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , no no problem , user interface: industrial designer: because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . industrial designer: So marketing: industrial designer: Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . marketing: So , what's the size of the device ? industrial designer: Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . marketing: Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still industrial designer: Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . marketing: Is it Can you hold that , or ? industrial designer: Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . project manager: A sm industrial designer: marketing: But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? user interface: industrial designer: W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , project manager: So maybe you can finish your presentation , user interface: project manager: and afterwards we will discuss about all this .  , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .  first I think energy it's a key problem because  it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? industrial designer: Not J  just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_  speech recognition and L_C_D_ , project manager: Okay . project manager: but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . marketing: So if we use s solar cells ,  where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? industrial designer: S  d doesn't need to be sun . industrial designer: Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that  that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . project manager: At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . industrial designer: Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? marketing: project manager: At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . industrial designer: Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . user interface: project manager: So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . industrial designer: project manager:  what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this  a such a a a screen . Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ? user interface:  . And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . You can take  some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f  taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So  seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one   How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . industrial designer: Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . industrial designer: Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . user interface: but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove  keys and just  having  , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . user interface: So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , project manager: Yeah . user interface: because project manager: The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . user interface: project manager: So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . marketing: So industrial designer: Okay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me user interface: A smaller s project manager: Yeah okay .  something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and industrial designer: Seven to ten banana . marketing: Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . user interface: marketing:  what other what other fruit and vegetables project manager: But it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but marketing: Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer: Well , but If it's If it If the banana is big enough . Well user interface: project manager: Yeah , and industrial designer: user interface: I think this is not good . project manager: The screen has to be square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite ,  with curves . industrial designer: But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . industrial designer: Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit  fatter than than the c c common one . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be   really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . project manager: So we are agree with the banana thing ? industrial designer: Well it we'll stick to banana , or ? user interface: Okay . project manager: So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . You have other thing to add to this point , or  no ? So ,  about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . You talked about the buttons on the side industrial designer: Like like peeling of the banana you s user interface: Yeah , peeling of the banana . marketing: industrial designer: First layer obviously spo Yeah , project manager: So industrial designer: w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . project manager: Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ? user interface:  project manager: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . marketing: I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , project manager: Yeah . marketing: you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and user interface: user interface: Yeah , some Something like a plastic cover covering  some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in  digital camera . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be  buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and  when  and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . project manager: Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . industrial designer: Well is it possible to make it soft ? user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . industrial designer: So I think if it's so then it's cool ? project manager: So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .  maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover  sticking to the to the all the stuff like  with magnetic p  magnetic  magnetic  materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're  while while  you are commonly using  buttons on the banana . industrial designer: Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and  how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b  So we need that the that the peeling  I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if  the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and industrial designer: It is possible , but , well if it marketing: And a and a banana . industrial designer: I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . project manager: And something we forgot , maybe ,  about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? marketing: user interface: Yes , I think . project manager: So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , user interface:  . marketing: user interface: project manager: And  , yeah , I  I think you should work together , s you  Hamed and Peter , to work  in a in a first prototype , and  more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together "

        "Summary": "The Project Manager and Industrial Designer had a discussion about the second layer of the remote, with the Project Manager expressing concerns about its complexity, but the Industrial Designer reassured that users wouldn't need to pay much attention to it. The group unanimously agreed that the scroll wheel was superior to average remotes, giving it a score of two on this criterion. They also agreed that the remote scored highly in terms of locatability, initially assuming it would be intuitive. However, the Industrial Designer mentioned that it might take some time for people to get used to the scroll wheel as it was a new technology. The Marketing team believed that its usage was obvious. As a result, the group decided to give an average score of five for this criterion.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Query": "What were the professor's thoughts on latencies, VAD latency, and the breakdown of latency?",
        "Summary": "The professor expressed satisfaction with the improved model, attributing it to lower latencies. He believed that the effort put into developing a good Voice Activity Detection (VAD) was worthwhile. In order to determine the latency added by the VAD, the professor suggested running the process in parallel. Additionally, the professor informed the team that the maximum latency was still unknown. PhD C provided an explanation of the delays caused by various factors, including a 100ms delay from silence probabilities, a 40ms delay from delta at the input, and a 10ms delay from LDA filters. The professor criticized the insistence on using a flawed system and emphasized the need for straightforward solutions. He emphasized the importance of keeping the lag short for the task at hand.",
        "Article": "professor c: OK , what are we talking about today ? phd b: I don't know . phd a: Oh , this was the , talk where they were supposed to try to decide phd b: To to decide what to do , phd a: Ah , right .  , so  , let 's let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead , phd b: Yeah . professor c: because even if they tell us that , the rules are different , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing .  , well , we 've a little bit worked on trying to see , what were the bugs and the problem with the latencies . phd d: To improve phd b: So , We took first we took the LDA filters and , we designed new filters , using  recursive filters actually . professor c: So when you say \" we \" , is that something Sunil is doing or is that ? phd b: I 'm sorry ? professor c: Who is doing that ? phd b: us . phd b: So we took the filters the FIR filters and we designed , IIR filters that have the same frequency response . phd b: So they had two filters , one for the low frequency bands and another for the high frequency bands . And the low frequency band has sixty - four milliseconds of delay , and the high frequency band filter has something like eleven milliseconds compared to the two hundred milliseconds of the IIR filters . So we have the filters but we still have to implement a routine that does recursive filtering professor c: OK . phd b: and professor c: You you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ? phd b: No . professor c: right ? So so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing , phd b: Yeah .  , I yeah , I don't know if th that 's what they were trying to They were trying to do something different like taking ,  well , using filter that takes only a past professor c: Right . I think that the the fact that we we did that with had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication . Well , there is w one , remark about these filters , that they don't have a linear phase . phd b: Well , I don't know , perhaps it perhaps it doesn't hurt because the phase is almost linear but .  , and so , yeah , for the delay I gave you here , it 's it 's , computed on the five hertz modulation frequency , which is the mmm , well , the most important for speech so . professor c: So that would be , a reduction of a hundred and thirty - six milliseconds , phd d: The low f f phd b: Yeah . professor c: which ,  What was the total we ended up with through the whole system ? phd b: Three hundred and thirty . professor c: So that would be within ? phd b: Yeah , but there are other points actually , which will perhaps add some more delay . Is that some other other stuff in the process were perhaps not very  perf well , not very correct , like the downsampling which w was simply dropping frames . phd b: so we will try also to add a nice downsampling having a filter that that professor c:  - huh .  , because wh when when we look at the LDA filters , well , they are basically low - pass but they leave a lot of what 's above twenty - five hertz . phd b: and so , yeah , this will be another filter which would add ten milliseconds again . phd b: yeah , and then there 's a third thing , is that , basically the way on - line normalization was done  , is just using this recursion on on the  , on the feature stream , professor c: Yeah .  , and when we look at this filter actually it has a delay of eighty - five milliseconds . If we want to be very correct , so if we want to the estimation of the mean t t to to be well , the right estimation of the mean , we have to t to take eighty - five milliseconds in the future . We would be at six so , sixty - five , plus ten , plus for the downsampling , plus eighty - five for the on - line normalization . So it 's professor c: phd b: plus plus eighty for the neural net and PCA . phd b: So it would be around two hundred and forty so , well , professor c: Just just barely in there . phd a: What 's the allowable ? professor c: Two - fifty , unless they changed the rules . phd a: What were they thinking of changing it to ? professor c: But phd b: Yeah . professor c: well the people who had very low latency want it to be low  , very very very narrow , latency bound . professor c: Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency , but phd a: Ah ! professor c: But , phd b: Yeah , and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency . professor c: Yeah , so they were basically  , they were more or less trading computation for performance and we were , trading latency for performance . And they were dealing with noise explicitly and we weren't , and so I think of it as complementary , that if we can put the phd a: Think of it as what ? professor c: Complementary . professor c: I think the best systems so , everything that we did in in a way it was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system , which is something actually , we 've done a lot over the last thirteen years . So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise . And , we did this , RASTA - like filtering which was done in the log domain and was tending to handle convolutional noise . So , the , spectral sub subtraction schemes a couple places did seem to seem to do a nice job . And so , we 're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff . I think you should be able to end up with a system that 's better than both but clearly the way that we 're operating for this other stuff does involved some latency to to get rid of most of that latency . To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we 'd have to throw out most of what we 're doing . And and , I don't think there 's any good reason for it in the application actually .  , you 're you 're you 're speaking to a recognizer on a remote server and , having a a a quarter second for some processing to clean it up . professor c: These aren't large vocabulary things so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time , and . phd a: And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency . What what does wa was your experience when you were doing this stuff with , the the the surgical , microscopes and so forth .  , how long was it from when somebody , finished an utterance to when , something started happening ? phd a: we had a silence detector , so we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector . phd a: And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance . phd a: but it was , I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds . phd a: So professor c: Yeah , so you you so you had a phd a: this w professor c: so you had a a quarter second delay before , plus some little processing time , phd a: Right . professor c: And there 's physical inertia there , so probably the the motion itself was all phd a: And it felt to , the users that it was instantaneous . professor c: Yeah , so you would think as long as it 's under half a second or something . A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds , and I 'm not even sure if we can tell the difference between a quarter of a second and half a second .  , basically if you yeah , if you said , \" what 's the ,  what 's the shortest route to the opera ? \" and it took half a second to get back to you , phd a: Yeah . phd a: because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other 's utterances . So like if I 'm asking you a question , you may start answering before I 'm even done . Well , anyway , I think we could cut we know what else , we could cut down on the neural net time by by , playing around a little bit , going more into the past , or something like that . phd a: So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ? professor c:   professor c: And there 's also well , there 's the neural net and there 's also this , multi - frame , KLT . phd a: Wasn't there Was it in the , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all ? professor c: They weren't looking ahead much . And and then But you also could just , we haven't experimented with this but I imagine you could , predict a , a label , from more in the past than in than than in the future . phd a: but I don't think professor c: Yeah , but we 've but we played a little bit with with asymmetric , guys . So , that 's what that 's what you 're busy with , s messing around with this , phd b: yeah . And , phd d: Also we were thinking to to , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson phd b: Yeah . professor c: phd a: What is the advantage of that ? phd d:  phd b: Well , it 's that by the for the moment we have , something that 's discriminant and nonlinear . Well , it 's it 's a linear transformation , that  professor c: So at least just to understand maybe what the difference was between how much you were getting from just putting the frames together and how much you 're getting from the discriminative , what the nonlinearity does for you or doesn't do for you . Actually what we want to do , perhaps it 's to replace to to have something that 's discriminant but linear , also . And to see if it if it improves ov over over the non - discriminant linear transformation . professor c: Yeah , well , that 's what I meant , is to see whether whether it having the neural net really buys you anything . professor c: But maybe it 's just the discrimination and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary . But the other part you were saying was the spectral subtraction , so you just kind of ,  phd b: Yeah . professor c: At what stage do you do that ? Do you you 're doing that ,  ? phd b: So it would be on the  on on the mel frequency bands , phd d: We was think phd b: so . professor c: OK , phd d: Yeah , professor c: so just do that on the mel f phd d: we no nnn We we was thinking to do before after VAD or phd b: Yeah , phd d: Oh , we don't know exactly when it 's better . phd b:  phd d: Before after VAD or professor c: So so you know that that that the way that they 're phd d: and then phd b:  . professor c: one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , run a good VAD , and and determine boundaries . professor c: The reason for that was that ,  if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't , or one had a better VAD than the other since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the the task , and that any any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection . It still wouldn't be perfect but  , e the argument was \" let 's not have that be part of this test . \" And so , I guess they argued about that yesterday and , yeah , I 'm sorry , I don't don't know the answer but we should find out . So ,  Yeah , so there 's the question of the VAD but otherwise it 's it 's on the the ,  the mel fil filter bank , energies I guess ? phd d:   professor c: And you 're you 're subtracting in the in the in the I guess it 's power power domain , or or magnitude domain . phd b: and professor c: if you look at the theory , it 's it should be in the power domain but but , I 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain phd b: Yeah . professor c: I have asked people why and they shrug their shoulders and say , \" oh , it works . professor c: and there 's this I guess there 's this mysterious  people who do this a lot I guess have developed little tricks of the trade .  , there 's there 's this ,  you don't just subtract the the estimate of the noise spectrum . phd b: so you have the estimation of the power spectra of the noise , and you multiply this by a factor which is depend dependent on the SNR . phd a:  ! phd b: When the speech lev when the signal level is more important , compared to this noise level , the coefficient is small , and around one . But when the power le the s signal level is  small compared to the noise level , the coefficient is more important . And this reduce actually the music musical noise , phd a: Oh ! phd b:  which is more important during silence portions , phd a:  - huh . professor c: Well , that 's  , that 's what differs from different different tasks and different s  , spectral subtraction methods . phd a:  ! professor c: if if you have , fair assurance that , the noise is is quite stationary , then the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise , get a much better estimate , and subtract it off . professor c: But if it 's varying at all , which is gonna be the case for almost any real situation , you have to do it on - line , with some forgetting factor or something . phd a: So do you is there some long window that extends into the past over which you calculate the average ? professor c: Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum . So one of the things that , Hans - Guenter Hirsch did ,  and pas and other people actually , he 's he wasn't the only one I guess , was to , take some period of of of speech and in each band , develop a histogram . And , in fact I think the NIST standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this . phd a: A couple seconds ? professor c: So No , no , it 's based on this kind of method , phd a:  . Now , if you have signal and you have noise , you basically have these two bumps in the histogram , which you could approximate as two Gaussians . professor c: So so basically now you have this mixture of two Gaussians , you you n know what they are , and , sorry , you estimate what they are , and , so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum . And the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to , determine through magical means that that , there 's no speech in some period , and then see what the spectrum is .  , a variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio is to just ,  you can do a w a  an iterative thing , EM - like thing , to determine means only . professor c: And then you just use those mean values as being the the ,   signal - to - noise ratio in that band . phd a: But what is the it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency . Cuz if you don't look into the future , right ? phd a: OK , well that I guess that was my question , professor c: if you just yeah phd a: yeah . professor c: if you just if you you ,  a at the beginning you have some phd a: Guess . professor c: esti some guess and and ,  phd b: Yeah , but it professor c: It 's an interesting question . I wonder how they did do it ? phd b: Actually , it 's a mmm If - if you want to have a good estimation on non - stationary noise you have to look in the in the future .  , if you take your window and build your histogram in this window , what you can expect is to have an estimation of th of the noise in in the middle of the window , not at the end . So professor c: Well , yeah , phd b: the but but people professor c: but what does what what what does Alcatel do ? phd d:   grad e: Pretty stationary , phd b: but ,  professor c: Well , the thing , e e e e grad e: yeah . professor c: Yeah , y  , you 're talking about non - stationary noise but I think that spectral subtraction is rarely is is not gonna work really well for for non - stationary noise , phd b: Well , if y if you have a good estimation of the noise , professor c: you know ? phd b: yeah , because well it it has to work . professor c: But it 's hard to phd b: i professor c: but that 's hard to do . So so I think that that what what is wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with r slowly varying or stationary noise . professor c: If it varies a lot , to get a If if to get a good estimate you need a few seconds of speech , even if it 's centered , right ? phd b:   professor c: if you need a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it 's changed a lot in a few seconds , then it , you know , i it 's kind of a problem . professor c: imagine e five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum , phd b: Mmm . So , phd b: So in this case , yeah , sure , you cannot professor c: Yeah . phd b: But I think y  , Hirsch does experiment with windows of like between five hundred milliseconds and one second .  and he worked on non - stationary noises , like noise modulated with well , wi with amplitude modulations and things like that , phd a: Were his , windows centered around the phd b: and But  , yeah . professor c: No , I understand it 's better to do but I just think that that , for real noises wh what what 's most likely to happen is that there 'll be some things that are relatively stationary phd b: Mmm . professor c: and other things where it 's not so stationary and  , you can always pick something that that falls between your methods , phd b:  . professor c: but I don't know if , you know , if sinusoidally , modul amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice . professor c: I think that it 's  phd a: We could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files , and built the averages from them . phd b: What What do you mean ? professor c: Just cheat You 're saying , cheat . phd b: But if the if the noise is stationary perhaps you don't even need some kind of noise estimation algorithm . phd b: We just take th th th the beginning of the utterance and professor c: Oh , yeah , sure . phd b: Well , everybody seems to use some kind of adaptive , well , scheme professor c: But but phd d: Yeah . phd b: is it very useful professor c: you know , stationary phd a: Very slow adaptation . phd b: and is the c phd a: th professor c: Right , the word \" stationary \" is has a very precise statistical meaning . But , you know , in in signal - processing really what we 're talking about I think is things that change slowly , compared with our our processing techniques . professor c: So if you 're driving along in a car I I would think that most of the time the nature of the noise is going to change relatively slowly . If you if you check it out , five minutes later you may be in a different part of the road phd b:   But it 's it 's i i i using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well . professor c: But you could get hurt a lot if you just took some something from the beginning of all the speech , of , you know , an hour of speech and then later phd b: Yeah . professor c: so they may be you know , may be overly , complicated for for this test but but but , I don't know .  , if possible you shouldn't you should you should make it , the center of the center of the window .  , phd a: If they 're going to provide a , voice activity detector that will tell you the boundaries of the speech , then , couldn't you just go outside those boundaries and do your estimate there ? professor c: Oh , yeah . So I I imagine that 's what they 're doing , right ? Is they 're they 're probably looking in nonspeech sections and getting some ,  phd b: Yeah , they have some kind of threshold on on the previous estimate , and So . Yeah , so , they h they have an estimate of the noise level and they put a threshold like six or ten DB above , and what 's under this threshold is used to update the estimate . It 's like saying what 's under the threshold is silence , professor c: Does France Telecom do this phd b: and grad e:  . professor c: Does France Telecom do th do the same thing ? More or less ? phd b: I d I Y you know , perhaps ? phd d: No .  , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly , just , things that that we 've been chatting about but haven't made it into these meetings yet . So you 're coming up with your quals proposal , and ,  Wanna just give a two three minute summary of what you 're planning on doing ? grad e: Oh , two , three , it can be shorter than that .  , but I 'm , looking into extending the work done by Larry Saul and John Allen and  Mazin Rahim .  , they they have a system that 's , a multi - band , system but their multi - band is is a little different than the way that we 've been doing multi - band in the past , where  Where we 've been @ @  taking  sub - band features and i training up these neural nets and on on phonetic targets , and then combining them some somehow down the line , they 're they 're taking sub - band features and , training up a detector that detects for , these phonetic features for example , he presents  , a detector to detect sonorance . And so what what it basically is is ,  it 's there 's at the lowest level , there it 's it 's an OR ga  , it 's an AND gate . So , on each sub - band you have several independent tests , to test whether  , there 's the existence of sonorance in a sub - band . And at the at the higher level , for every if ,  The higher level there 's a soft OR gate .  , so if if this detector detects  , the presence of of sonorance in any of the sub - bands , then the detect  , the OR gate at the top says , \" OK , well this frame has evidence of sonorance . \" phd a: What are what are some of the low level detectors that they use ? grad e: And these are all Oh , OK .  , and the ,  professor c: So that , by the way , basically is a is one of the units in our in our our neural network . Yeah , so he uses , an EM algorithm to to  train up these  parameters for the logistic regression . professor c: Well , actually , yeah , grad e: The professor c: so I was using EM to get the targets . So so you have this this this AND gate what we were calling an AND gate , but it 's a product product rule thing at the output . And then he uses , i u and then feeding into that are I 'm sorry , there 's it 's an OR at the output , isn't it ? Yeah , grad e:   phd a: And so are each of these , low level detectors are they ,  are these something that you decide ahead of time , like \" I 'm going to look for this particular feature or I 'm going to look at this frequency , \" or What what what are they looking at ? grad e:  phd a: What are their inputs ? grad e:  Right , so the OK , so at each for each sub - band there are basically , several measures of SNR and and correlation .  , and for for every s every sub - band , e you you just pick ahead of time , \" I 'm going to have like five i independent logistic tests . grad e: And you initialize these parameters , in some some way and use EM to come up with your training targets for a for the the low - level detectors . grad e: And then , once you get that done , you you you train the whole whole thing on maximum likelihood .  , and h he shows that using this this method to detect sonorance is it 's very robust compared to ,  to typical , full - band Gaussian mixtures  estimations of of sonorance . You get enough of these detectors together , then you have enough information to do , higher level discrimination , for example , discriminating between phones phd a:   grad e: and then you keep working your way up until you you build a full recognizer . grad e: So , that 's that 's the direction which I 'm I 'm thinking about going in my quals .  , one is the going towards , using narrow band information for , ph phonetic features of some sort rather than just , immediately going for the the typical sound units . professor c: Another thing I like about it is that you t this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for a product of errors rule , which is what , Allen keeps pointing out that Fletcher observed in the twenties , phd a:   And then , the third thing I like about it is , and we 've played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit but it hasn't been our dominant way of of operating anything , this issue of where the targets come from . So in our case when we 've been training it multi - band things , the way we get the targets for the individual bands is , that we get the phonetic label for the sound there phd a:   professor c: and we say , \" OK , we train every \" What this is saying is , OK , that 's maybe what our ultimate goal is or not ultimate but penultimate goal is getting these these small sound units . But but , along the way how much should we , what should we be training these intermediate things for ?  , because , we don't know  , that this is a particularly good feature .  , there 's no way ,  someone in the audience yesterday was asking , \" well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not ? \" phd a:   professor c: But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide , chunks of speech trying to determine whether I think it 'd be impossible . professor c: It 's all gonna sound like like sine waves to you , more or less . professor c:  Well not  , it 's g all g narrow band  , i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination . It could sh be that you should , not be paying that much attention to , certain bands for certain sounds , in order to get the best result . professor c: So , what we have been doing there , just sort of mixing it all together , is certainly much much cruder than that . Now we have I guess done experiments you 've probably done stuff where you have , done separate , Viterbis on the different grad e: Yeah . Did did that help at all ? grad e: it helps for one or t one iteration but  , anything after that it doesn't help . professor c: So so that may or may t it that aspect of what he 's doing may or may not be helpful because in a sense that 's the same sort of thing . You 're taking global information and determining what you how you should But this is this is , I th I think a little more direct . phd a: How did they measure the performance of their detector ? professor c: And Well , he 's look he 's just actually looking at , the confusions between sonorant and non - sonorant . professor c: So he hasn't applied it to recognition or if he did he didn't talk about it . It 's it 's just And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , the ,  he he did a comparison to , you know , our old foil , the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth . But the one of the good questions in the audience was , well , yeah , but that wasn't trained for that .  , this use of a very smooth , spectral envelope is something that , you know , has evolved as being generally a good thing for speech recognition but if you knew that what you were gonna do is detect sonorants or not So sonorants and non - sonorants is is is almost like voiced - unvoiced , except I guess that the voiced stops are are also called \" obstruents \" .  , so it 's it 's  , but with the exception of the stops I guess it 's pretty much the same as voiced - unvoiced , phd a:   So , if you knew you were doing that , if you were doing something say for a a ,  a a Vocoder , you wouldn't use the same kind of features . Nonetheless , it was one that was interesting because , this is what we are actually using for speech recognition , these smooth envelopes . And this says that perhaps even , you know , trying to use them in the best way that we can , that that that we ordinarily do , with , you know , Gaussian mixtures and H M Ms and so forth , you you don't , actually do that well on determining whether something is sonorant or not . phd a: Didn't they professor c: Which means you 're gonna make errors between similar sounds that are son sonorant or obstruent . phd a: Didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment where they said \" if we could detect the sonorants perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition ? I thought I remember hearing about an experiment like that . professor c: That would that 's you 're right , that 's exactly the question to follow up this discussion , is suppose you did that , got that right . phd b: What could be the other low level detectors , for Other kind of features , or ? in addition to detecting sonorants or ? Th - that 's what you want to to to go for also grad e:  phd b: or ? grad e: What t Oh , build other other detectors on different phonetic features ? phd b: Other low level detectors ? Yeah . e  , w easiest thing would be to go go do some voicing stuff but that 's very similar to sonorance . grad e: phd a: When we when we talked with John Ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that w grad e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah , so there 's a half dozen like that that are grad e: Yeah , nasality . professor c: Now this was coming at it from a different angle but maybe it 's a good way to start .  , these are things which , John felt that a a ,  a human annotator would be able to reliably mark . So the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark would be tongue position kinds of things . professor c: But stress doesn't , fit in this thing of coming up with features that will distinguish words from one another , grad e:   professor c: right ? It 's a it 's a good thing to mark and will probably help us ultimate with recognition phd a: Yeah , there 's a few cases where it can like permit and permit . professor c: Well , yeah , but i either case you 'd write PERMIT , right ? So you 'd get the word right . phd a: No , I 'm saying , i i e I thought you were saying that stress doesn't help you distinguish between words . As long as you get The sequence , professor c: We 're g if we 're doing if we 're talking about transcription as opposed to something else phd a: right ? Yeah . Yeah , so that 's yeah , that 's , you know , a neat neat thing and and ,  So . grad e: S so , Ohala 's going to help do these ,  transcriptions of the meeting data ? phd a: well I don't know .  , we just talked about some possible features that could be marked by humans and , grad e:  . phd a: because of having maybe some extra transcriber time we thought we could go through and mark some portion of the data for that . professor c: that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time . professor c: But but , in the long term I guess Chuck is gonna continue the dialogue with John and and , and , we 'll we 'll end up doing some I think .  , so , y you want to talk maybe a c two or three minutes about what we 've been talking about today and other days ? grad f: Ri Yeah , OK , so , we 're interested in , methods for far mike speech recognition , mainly , methods that deal with the reverberation in the far mike signal . So , one approach would be , say MSG and PLP , like was used in Aurora one and , there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG . And so we 're interested in , comparing the performance of  , a robust approach like MSG with these , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches . grad f: And , it looks like we 're gonna use the Meeting Recorder digits data for that . phd b: And the de - reverberation algorithm , do you have can you give some more details on this or ? Does it use one microphone ? grad f: o o phd b: Several microphones ? Does it ? grad f: OK , well , there was something that was done by , a guy named Carlos , I forget his last name , who worked with Hynek , who , professor c: Avendano . grad f: it was like RASTA in the sense that of it was , de - convolution by filtering  , except he used a longer time window , phd b:   And the reason for that is RASTA 's time window is too short to ,  include the whole , reverberation  , I don't know what you call it the reverberation response . The reverberation filter from my mouth to that mike is like it 's t got it 's too long in the in the time domain for the  for the RASTA filtering to take care of it . And , then there are a couple of other speech enhancement approaches which haven't been tried for speech recognition yet but have just been tried for enhancement , which , have the assumption that  , you can do LPC  analysis of th of the signal you get at the far microphone and the , all pole filter that you get out of that should be good . It 's just the , excitation signal that is going to be distorted by the reverberation and so you can try and reconstruct a better excitation signal and , feed that through the i  , all pole filter and get enhanced speech with reverberation reduced . professor c: There 's also this , echo cancellation stuff that we 've sort of been chasing , so ,  we have ,  and when we 're saying these digits now we do have a close microphone signal and then there 's the distant microphone signal . And you could as a kind of baseline say , \" OK , given that we have both of these , we should be able to do , a cancellation . \" So that , we we , essentially identify the system in between the linear time invariant system between the microphones and and and and re and invert it , or or cancel it out to to some some reasonable approximation phd b: that 's not a practical thing , if you have a distant mike , you don't have a close mike ordinarily , but we thought that might make also might make a good baseline .  , but And then there are s  , there are single microphone methods that I think people have done for ,  for this kind of de - reverberation . Do y do you know any references to any ? Cuz I I w I was w w I I lead him down a a bad path on that . phd b: I g I guess I guess when people are working with single microphones , they are more trying to do professor c: But . phd b: well , not not very Well , there is the Avendano work , professor c: Right . phd b: but also trying to mmm ,  trying to f t find the de - convolution filter but in the  not in the time domain but in the  the stream of features  I guess . Well , @ @ there there 's someone working on this on i in Mons professor c: Yeah , OK . phd b: So perhaps , yeah , we should try t to He 's working on this , on trying to professor c: Yeah . phd b: on re reverberation ,  professor c: The first paper on this is gonna have great references , I can tell already . professor c: It 's always good to have references , especially when reviewers read it or or one of the authors and , feel they 'll \" You 're OK , you 've r You cited me . Well , he did echo cancellation and he did some fancier things like , training different network on different reverberation conditions and then trying to find the best one , but . professor c: The oth the other thing , that Dave was talking about earlier was , multiple mike things , where they 're all distant . So , there 's there 's all this work on arrays , but the other thing is , what can we do that 's cleverer that can take some advantage of only two mikes , particularly if there 's an obstruction between them , as we as we have over there . It 's part of why you have such good directionality with , with two ears phd b:   professor c: So that Yeah , the the head , in the way , is really that 's what it 's for . It 's basically , phd a: That 's what the head 's for ? To separate the ears ? professor c: Yeah , it 's to separate the ears . professor c: Yeah ? phd a: I think th that may be due to the fact that Adam ran out of digits , and didn't have time to regenerate any . professor c: Oh ! Oh ! I guess it 's Well there 's no real reason to write our names on here then , phd a: Yeah , if you want to put your credit card numbers and ,  professor c: is there ? grad e: Oh , no ? professor c: Or do did any do we need the names for the other stuff , phd a: yeah , I do need your names and and the time , and all that , professor c: or ? Oh , OK "

        "Query": "Why was the concept of an intelligent controller proposed by the user interface designer and disapproved by the project manager?",
        "Summary": "The user interface designer proposed incorporating speech recognition and gesture recognition technologies into the controller for convenience and to differentiate it from traditional controllers. However, the project manager raised concerns about the reliability of these features and the potential increase in cost. The designer suggested collaborating with a research institute to address these issues, as the vocabulary would be limited and language adaptations could be made for international users. Despite these solutions, there were still unresolved problems with the necessary microphone and camera for the technologies.",
        "Article": "project manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first  marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager: What ? marketing: No ? project manager: I I think I will let  our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . The second concept is a fancy controller ,  so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,  they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g  industrial designer:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: It's very big , user interface: if you're project manager: yeah . marketing: user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . user interface: so maybe we should  use   technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and  gesture recognition . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but as the  expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface:  I think some time it's very  convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just  speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you have one brother and one sister marketing: Yeah project manager: and they want to watch their favourite  T_V_ programme , marketing: Yeah , but the project manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , industrial designer: Yeah but Yeah user interface: Yeah , it's very interesting . industrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I don't think it project manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , industrial designer: It's it's marketing: No . user interface: so it's c come to channel three , marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . user interface: I don't have to project manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager: Yeah , but one other question . marketing:  if you if if you use the basic user interface: No no we just  have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? Or ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's  because  this technology is   for limited wor or limited wor  lexical recognition , it's very project manager: Yeah , but   user interface: it's  yeah . It's marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . industrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem , user interface: No it's  Even for the f  because the the vocabulary the industrial designer: you know when you project manager: project manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that  Baba talked about is the international industrial designer: Yeah . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , the key , the key  the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some  adaptation marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or industrial designer: Yeah but you know . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . industrial designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe project manager: okay . user interface: Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah , but how will you user interface: So industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . industrial designer: because  the for example for Se user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to industrial designer: Oh really ? That's project manager: Oh . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , but we're marketing: No , but then it's it's like this  project manager: here it's  an object . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . user interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: No no it's n y if you lose it industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . project manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it we should give the  flexibility to the user and we think marketing: Okay , so you project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if  ,  I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , but marketing: But if if if it like doubles  industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . user interface: project manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that marketing:  industrial designer: It's not really the we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But  I think a user need user interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah user interface: Okay . user interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing: Cause for example yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but  we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah ,  project manager: You don't need to tune it . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's marketing: for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . marketing:  thi this  , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The then nn marketing: or user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See user interface: That's the same marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah .  , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two  project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: industrial designer: so . marketing: industrial designer: So I think project manager: I can industrial designer: Can you go to the next one ? I  it's not this one . industrial designer: It's  oth the oth so I marketing: industrial designer: It's the working design . project manager: It's okay industrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use project manager: industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager:  I think there's something wrong with your user interface: It did didn't r receive it . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with  user interface:  to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: exac marketing: project manager: You will had s some more information in industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with user interface: project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: industrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example  d  solar energy alimentation user interface: -huh . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have  both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities  for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: industrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . project manager: And what tha what about the  materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for industrial designer: or you know , you can have some project manager: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . project manager: And you think that we will be industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know  yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or  if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . industrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .  , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  i i it sounds good technically user interface:  . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Wha what we really see this year is that  everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then  if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion  from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: Spongy 'Kay . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like  industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like  industrial designer: Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be  enough to have something working well . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No wood but Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but  ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah ,  it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: Google and project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer:  maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface:  yes . industrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: so . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . And pf what can we think a supplement to marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something added value . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the  simple vocal commands recognition . project manager:  you will have to work more , Baba , on the  spongy way to to add spongy  touch to the buttons industrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and  the colour of the  the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . project manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us  modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach "

        "Summary": "In the second phase of data collection, the group plans to use more complex scenarios to generate intricate dialogues. To ensure an adequate number of participants, subjects will be recruited from within the Psychology department, as their participation in experiments is mandatory. The group's goal is to collect over 100 hours of Meeting Recorder data, and they are currently revising the speaker consent forms. It has been proposed that subjects should sign a new consent form after every 10 recording sessions.",
        "Article": "professor a: We 're not recording yet , are we ? grad g: Well , I don't think phd f: No , that that wasn't recorded . phd f: I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something . phd f: I was just noticing a big s professor d: So are we recording now ? Is this phd e: Yeah . professor d: So , what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ? grad g: I think that phd e: It 's a good idea . grad g: u usually we 've done that and also we 've s done digits as well , but I forgot to print any out . Besides with this big a group , phd b: You can write them on the board , if you want . I it 'd be even better with this big grad g: it would take too much time . phd e: Mari ? postdoc h: What professor a: What ? professor d: It 's not that long . professor d: w u phd e: So that thing the little th that part should be pointing upwards . professor a: It 's kind of professor d: Oh , yeah , the element , yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection , and , you you put up there data format , professor a:  . professor d: and other tasks during data collection , professor a: So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get professor d: and professor a: what can you add to it to get , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like grad g: especially for querying . postdoc h: Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , i  , if he I ,  if he has s I I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? grad g: Landay . postdoc h: La - Landay ? So he has , these , tsk note - taking things , professor a:   postdoc h: then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . professor a: Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or  , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . grad g: But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , postdoc h:   And so , you know phd f: the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up professor a: So grad g: pretty easily . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things . So , if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . professor d: I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . professor a: But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? professor d: No , not a No , I just My mind went elsewhere . So , yeah , I 'm Morgan , and where am I ? I 'm on channel three . postdoc h: Should we have used pseudo - names ? Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . professor d: I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel phd e: Let me , turn that off . grad g: And , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z phd e: Oh . phd e: PDM - right , PZA - right PDA - right , PDA - left . grad g: Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . postdoc h: I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say \" Jimlet \" and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? You know , the Jimlet  , the box that contains the professor d: Well , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know . professor d: we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?  , do we have s people write summaries ? Everybody or one person ? And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? Is that phd f: There 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? professor a: Right . phd f: that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . phd f: But there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . professor d: There 's there 's another problem grad g: And professor d: which is , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . And , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group and and , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , \" OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , the summar \" grad g: Well , I asked them to and none of them did . grad g: So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting postdoc h:   grad g: So I didn't track them down and say \" please do th do it now \" . professor d: I I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , professor a: Right . professor d: as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . grad g: I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say \" that 's important , that might be a query \" . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , there are certain key words like , you know , \" action item \" and things like that , which could be used in , t to some degree finding the structure . phd e: Although professor a: W postdoc h: And and I also , was thinking , with reference to the n  , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , I think they should be recorded instead of written because I think that , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . professor a: How about this idea ? That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . professor a: And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? postdoc h: Yeah . grad g: that gives you a summary but it doesn't really How do you generate queries from that ? phd e: Well . But , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . phd b: Actually And so grad g: James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me . professor d: Well , I think that we  , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings professor a: Well professor d: and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed grad g: Yep . professor d: And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and at the very least . So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . phd b: you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . phd b: It may not be kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important . phd b: And that wouldn't take any extra postdoc h: That 's a nice idea . phd b: Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad professor d: It professor c:   It 's professor d: That 's a good idea but that doesn't Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? professor a: Well , what it does phd b: Well , then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . phd b: And grad g: y professor a: I I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se , but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say \" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? \" phd b: Yeah . professor d: That that 's what  , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , \" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? \" , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . phd e: Well , see , there are th professor a: I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , when  , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . phd b: At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords professor d: Maybe . grad g: i this would tell you what the hit is , phd b: and grad g: not what the query is . grad g: And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , professor a: Right . grad g: but phd b: We don't even know what  , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user , professor d:   professor d: Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that phd b:  . professor d: because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in in i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of of of queries . So he 's just sort of going \" where where do I where do I start ? \" professor a: w Well , th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there , professor d: OK . One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . professor a: So \" action item \" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . professor a: the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying \" here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? \" grad g: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . professor a: Well grad g: But , I think it would give professor a: That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , grad g:   So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . phd e: But th there is this ,  There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think \" oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? \" And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you professor a:   phd e: And that 's kind of what this kind of , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . phd e: Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . So ,  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur . phd e: But  , it 's difficult to sort of say \" and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? \" Those aren't the kind of things that come up . postdoc h: I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , \" we discussed types of na data collection \" . If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it even if you don't have a direct route to that . postdoc h: I think that grad g: That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . phd b: No , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker grad g: But they phd b: And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , and they can use it for their research .  , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , grad g:   But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , professor d:   Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it . grad g: And so the question is \" is there such a person ? \" And I think right now , the answer is \" no \" . professor a: Well professor d: I 've b been thinking grad g: We 'll just have to see . professor d: I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the  , th this , e  I think that the now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , is actually a reasonable , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at . It 's it 's not ideal , but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . So I was I was just thinking about , suppose we wanted to get w We have this collection of meeting . So now we have five hours of meetings and , you ask me , \" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? \"  , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go \" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , I remember that , what was the part that \" And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , professor d:   professor a:  phd b: So how does the summary get generated ? professor a: Well , i i ? phd b: I 'm not against the idea of a summary , grad g: By hand . phd b: but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it professor a: Or , d o phd b: and how because the summary will drive the queries . professor a: What I I think , you know , in most meetings , phd b: So professor a: this one being different , but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  , you can just make it be on a laptop , phd b:   professor a: so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . postdoc h: I I I think that , there 's we 're using \" summary \" in two different ways . postdoc h: And what I originally thought was , if you asked someone \" what was the meeting about ? \" phd b: OK . postdoc h: And then they would say \" well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about \" And then you 'd have , like I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that professor a:   postdoc h: Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , with mult See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . And , you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , professor d:   professor d: A postdoc h: So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , professor a: OK . postdoc h: no longer than two minutes , professor d: Adam , you can postdoc h: from multiple people . professor d: but but , my impression was that , pretty much , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w  , with a laptop grad g: Never . Does anyone ? phd b: Dan ? professor d: I grad g: Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , phd e: Yeah . Most of the meetings we have are four or five people grad g: That 's true are four or five people . professor d: and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . professor a: So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . grad g: The IRAM meeting , they they take notes every professor d: Do they ? grad g: There 's  a person with a laptop at each meeting . phd b: I don't know how , but for instance , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . phd e: We sh we should grad g: I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , postdoc h: I agree . phd e: f u I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera grad g: Yeah , different phd b: y phd e: just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . grad g: But don't you think that 's Don't you think that But postdoc h: I agree .  , I I just think  , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . phd e: Not not as part of the not as a part of the data that you have to recover . phd e: Just just in terms of phd b: We should just Like archiving it or storing it . postdoc h: It 's i because discourse is about things , phd b: Because someone postdoc h: and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . phd b: someone later might be able to take these and say \" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there phd e: So phd b: and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and \" and just postdoc h: Yes . professor d: Li postdoc h: Like you said , three snapshots professor d: L L L postdoc h: and professor d: Liz , you postdoc h: Just to archive . professor d: u  , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , subcommittee meeting or whatever phd e: Actually professor d: on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the ,  that workshop we were at that , Mark Liberman was was having . They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect professor d:   phd b: And professor d: I think you  , that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing . professor d: And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . professor d: So ,  grad g: But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . So we 're gonna So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us . phd b: I think even doing something very crude professor d: But having phd b: Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . phd b: And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . So if you can find some really , you know , low , perplexity , grad g: Low fidelity . And if it 's simple as  , as simple as just the digital phd b: Otherwise you 'd you lose it . professor d: Well , minimally , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so ,  grad g: Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier professor d: Yeah . grad g: But phd b: Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time professor d:   phd b: and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room . So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded . grad g: So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say \" I won't participate \" . phd b: Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head grad g:  phd b: and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting talking . phd b: That would be an interes Bu postdoc h: Well professor d: Great idea . But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards , phd b: Yeah . postdoc h: sp spatial organization And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , this is grad g: But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work . postdoc h: We can talk about the grad g: To set it up and then anonymize it ? postdoc h: It 's just one snapshot . phd b: No , it wa n not ,  professor a: No , no , no , no . Maybe we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it , phd f: Did they store it digitally , or ? postdoc h: but phd b:   I think they just phd f: or just put it on videotape ? phd b: I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Well , I think for  , for our purposes we probably will d phd b: I 'm not sure . professor d: we we might try that some and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think . postdoc h: Th The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And phd b: I 'm just The community If LDC collects this data u  , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there . phd b: And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , easier made easier if you had the video . professor d: I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . professor d: As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , and and will include all that . professor d: professor a: e professor d: I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , subsets of that . Like for a meeting like this , at least , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , phd b: Of the board . phd b: Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board . professor d: a and know the position of the people phd b: That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . phd b: otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .  , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . grad g: except in postdoc h: s grad g: er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost .  , I just think that the grad g: The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . postdoc h: Well professor a: What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , is in the record . postdoc h: Well professor a: Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  , we  , we don't need to require it . professor a: so so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . professor d: So So , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody from from today ? OK . professor d: So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . professor d: And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries and are we gonna do anything about that . professor a: So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? professor d: Yeah . professor a: So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna n I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . professor d: I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . professor d: So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . professor d: So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero , professor a: Nothing . professor d: and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou professor a: OK . phd b: I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . grad g: And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well . So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . I think it it it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . grad g: but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . professor d: I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another . That if if people have something in front of them phd b: I 'd be sort of cool . So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? grad g: Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . professor d: So who who does this summarization ? postdoc h: Yeah , I 'm thinking that grad g: People in the meeting . grad g: You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go , postdoc h:  - huh . phd e: People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . phd b: Well , then you should try them a few weeks later postdoc h: How fascinating . phd b: and They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain grad g: And see score them ? phd e: That 's right . phd b: and wasn't phd e: If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . professor a: But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , professor d: Ru grad g: I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . professor a: because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . grad g: Maybe e Is email easier ? postdoc h: Well , I think if grad g: I when you first said do do it , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up postdoc h:   postdoc h: Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . But , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay . professor a: But , you know , if you get even one postdoc h: w professor d: Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , postdoc h: I would s Yeah . professor d: that that y that you can't certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . postdoc h: And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be  , phd e: Yeah . postdoc h: Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed , phd e: Right . postdoc h: just phd f: So I have a question about queries , grad g: God , that 's bugging me . phd f: which is , grad g: Can we turn that light off ? postdoc h: You turn phd f:  grad g: If can we turn that just that that let professor d: The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . grad g: Yeah , there 's a phd b: Oh , it is it is like OK . professor a: That and y Too much caffeine and really tired , grad g: Too much caffeine . phd f: the question I had about queries was , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are are we gonna try and o grad g: We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? phd f: Yeah . phd f: so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?  , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , professor d: Mmm . phd f: n phd b: Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? professor d: Yeah . phd b: They 're the expert phd e: Mari ? professor a: Yeah ? phd e: Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ? professor a: what 's our schedule ? professor d: Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . professor a: Let 's see , you and I need dis  , no , we did the Liz talk . professor a: We need to finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So , grad g: And what ? professor a:  professor d: I 'm at your disposal . professor a: what what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should professor d: I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? grad g: At least . professor a: So , I think phd b: It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free professor d: Well , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . professor d: And professor a: e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't phd e: OK , five - thirty . grad g: Well , in answer to \" is it Landay 's problem ? \" , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . professor d: Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I I actually think that that , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .  , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and ,  phd b: But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . phd f: Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . phd f: Right ? Of how to how to generate queries from a phd b: How to do this from the summary . phd b: So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . phd b: and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or or a deeper Yeah . phd b: You postdoc h: I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be \" what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? \" Becau - in terms of like informativeness , phd b: That 's a good one . postdoc h: it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . professor a: But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . postdoc h: Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . postdoc h: So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary . But with the \" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? \"  , so the fact that , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting phd b: Going to see the kids . So , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings professor a:   professor c: Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? grad g: As many are willing to do it . Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? professor c: and then Yeah . phd e: So grad g: Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done  , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . professor a: But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , grad g: Mmm . postdoc h: And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the some some of the little things that would be hidden . professor d: Boy , I I don't know how we get at this postdoc h: That would be interesting . professor c: Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something grad g: Or want to get up and leave . professor c: and then you go around the room and they say \" yeah , me too , I agree . professor c: So phd e: On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? professor d: Well phd e: They might say \" oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else \" . grad g: Well , you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll  , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say .  , It seemed The kind of , interest that I had in this thing initially was , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , professor a:   So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else professor a: Right . professor d: in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now You weren't interested Say I I said \" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person \" . professor d: But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm \" well what is what was that part that that that , Mari was saying ? \" grad g: Yeah , like Jim Bass says \" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf \" professor a:  professor d: Yeah . professor d: And then I 'm trying to fi  , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . professor a: Well , I That 's hard to generate professor d: So , I don't I don't know . phd f: Do we professor a: and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times  , make you know , think to myself \" this is interesting , professor d:   professor a: So , things that I think are interesting , I would be , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . That that might get at some of what I was I was concerned about , being interested in something later that w  , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up . grad g: But But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . grad g: Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it , professor d: Yeah . phd f: The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? professor d:   But postdoc h: Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying \" important \" and we 're saying \" interesting \" . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that  , postdoc h:   professor d: W phd f: does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? professor d: Well , irreversible . phd f: That 's that 's professor d: I I  , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and ,  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . If you know , if  , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that . postdoc h: I will say that that I I chose \" interesting \" because I think it includes also \" important \" in some cases . postdoc h: Well , and and also i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate . You know , I think inter \" interesting \" is is non - threatening in professor a: OK - OK . professor a: In the interest of , grad g: Importance ? postdoc h: Yeah . professor a: No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , and also moving on to action items and other things , let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , that we at least decided on . CrossPads we were going to try , if Landay can get the ,  get them to to you guys , and see if they 're interesting . professor a: getting just , digital pictures a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .  , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , postdoc h: k professor a: and that way you 'll get more variety . \" And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . professor a: OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? That well , that we want to do ? postdoc h:   grad g: Yeah , that 's like n I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then . postdoc h: And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . phd e: there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . phd e: And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . grad g: Give them a reward , a dollar a query ? phd e: Yeah , really . So professor d: Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then  , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to postdoc h: Yeah .  , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? grad g: Well , we 're gonna phd b: So you need to have some sort of if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha phd e:  . phd b: In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . phd b: It But it may well grad g: But professor d: Because  , b because it depends on , what our goal is . grad g: Really ? professor d: If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . professor d: And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , phd e: Yeah . grad g: Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings . phd e: Well just imagine if professor d: But but just phd e: Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , professor d: Yeah . w Just \" what would you like to know ? \" phd e: but grad g: Yep . postdoc h: I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like \" action item \" , professor a: OK . postdoc h: Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , phd b: Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you . phd b: So , in general , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to do this . Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , \" other than your action item \" , you know , whatever . phd e: Well postdoc h: But but the action item would be a way to get , maybe an additional query . Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ professor a: Well , we 're piloting . professor a: or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav professor d: We we had  , phd e: Yeah . professor d: somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , from the description things ? professor a: I got Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . professor d: And , you know , there 's obviously detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , requirements . professor a: people are supposed to send me U R for their for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . We professor a:  ? phd e: we need to look at our web page professor a: And and you also need to look at your web page phd e: and make one that 's that 's p professor a: and clean it up by mid - July . And so ,  professor a: How about if I just c  , Right now all I want I personally only want text data . I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . professor d: Wh postdoc h: You could email to both of us , just  , if you wanted to . postdoc h: I don't think either of us would mind recei professor a: OK . postdoc h: but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the professor a: And your email is ? professor d: i postdoc h: Edwards at ICSI . professor a: And then professor d: In in our phone call , before , we we ,  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , And ,  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service , that will grad g: Oh , is this IBM ? professor d: Yeah . postdoc h: Yeah , using foot pedals professor d: Yeah , foot foot pedals postdoc h: and professor d: and grad g: so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? professor d: See , that 's a good question . professor d: probably about like you did , grad g: Mix ? professor d: and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well . And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll they 'll ,  they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . professor d: We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff grad g: So we 'll give them all sixteen channels professor d: and grad g: and they 'll do whatever they want with it . phd b: But you also should probably give them the mixed You know , equal sound - level professor d: Yeah . professor d: It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . phd f: But w phd b: I phd f: It 's not professor a: Right . phd b: You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did . I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , the on - line , data that Adam set up , The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up postdoc h: Good . grad g: And then p possibly postdoc h: I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . grad g: Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . We were gonna grad g: Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . professor a: That 's postdoc h: Well ,  professor a: W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work phd e: Well  , yeah . So , what n important thing professor a: but Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , postdoc h: Well , it c phd e: Right . professor d: So a key thing will be that you we tell you postdoc h: Great . phd f: and \" professor d: We also had the ,  that we were s  , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number professor a: Oh , yeah . professor d: and we 're all gonna we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , depending on how you define it , users . professor c: Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users . Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , professor a: Yeah . Or , like if you have a professor c: who know that you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . professor a: Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you , professor c: So . e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . professor d: My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it grad g: He would never use it . So I have the professor d: We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , w e e e they 're you know , they 're p m If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , major communications between Dan and UW folks phd e: Yeah .  , professor a: I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August . professor d: as to phd e: we should talk about it , but postdoc h: Mmm . professor a: So , you know , if professor d: But we have it it 's it 's pretty We don't know .  , he he s  , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust professor a: We don't know . professor d: and and so we don't know , professor a: i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , professor d: i e professor a: but a at least it 's worth trying .  , and I will email these notes  , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . professor d: and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have grad g:   professor a: Oh ! professor d: some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . phd e: Yeah , that was  , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . But it 's p it might be phd e: so professor a: But but that 's actually what I wanna do . grad g: Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . If I don't get something grad g: Who ? Landay or Jason ? professor a: Landay . professor a: you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers or I could I could use ,  I could use your web pages . You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor professor d: Yeah , why search for them ? professor a: Yeah ! professor d: They 're we know where they are . professor d: There 's there 's some , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On on meeting recording , grad g: Yep . professor a: So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox , professor d: and phd b: And there 's You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , professor d: And Xerox . phd b: smart rooms , grad g: the \" Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand \" is a good one . J There 's th That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , professor a:   phd b: because of all these classroom grad g: Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of . postdoc h: Can I ask , one thing ? It relates to data data collection and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  , so , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , are lessened . But I wonder if  , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , u w we would c  , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever . postdoc h: Now , you know , it 's true , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . phd f: Adam ! postdoc h: But , i i  , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? professor d:  . phd e: turn off professor a: I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , postdoc h: OK . Just want to be sure there 's enough data to professor a: phd b: They 're still gonna overlap , postdoc h: OK , good . phd b: but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . professor d: Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . postdoc h: because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . postdoc h: Not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired . But if if that 's sufficient data I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people postdoc h: Time . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . professor a: Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . Well , I just as as as a contributary eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know you know , \" wait till each person is finished before you say something \" . professor a: Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , unintrusive as possi postdoc h:   I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u  , you know , as much data as we can . Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ? phd b:   professor d: What phd b: And there was a big division , professor d: What what do they phd b: so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . phd b: So there 's lots of recordings that They 're not close - talk mike , professor d: Yeah . phd b: but And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings .  , and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , professor d:   Is that is that going to be publicly available , phd b: As far as I know , they h have not . grad g: It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? phd b: I 'm not sure .  , if people were interested they could talk to them , but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved . grad g: Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field , phd b: I think you need to talk to Waibel and grad g: intelligent - room sorts of things . phd b: But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . Well , once we send out postdoc h: Yeah , I think professor d: we still haven't sent out the first note saying \" hey , this list exists \" . But but , once we do that professor a: Is that an action item ? professor d: Yeah . We should at least check that everybody here ? grad g: I think everyone here is on the list . grad g: I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me . grad g: You are on it , aren't you ? postdoc h: Yeah , I am . So \" found data \" , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ? phd b: What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect , postdoc h: It sounds like such a t phd b: and especially good postdoc h: Yeah , OK . It 's things occur without any You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . Of course it 's not \" found \" in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . phd b: But what he means is that You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , postdoc h: That 's interesting . phd e: We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? professor a: Oh . phd b: Rrrh ! grad g: Now , I was already thinking about it , so professor d: Oh ! Good man . phd b: I grad g: So , I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that . postdoc h: Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , I I found this discussion very , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought was worthwhile . grad g: Did you take pictures of the boards ? phd e: Not that I postdoc h: Yeah .  , I will take pictures of them , but postdoc h: That 's a good point . phd f: I 'm gonna pass because I can't  , of the Jane took my answer . But I will say  , I will actually  , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , in this project . professor d: Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . phd e: How are we gonna find that in the data ? grad g: Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time phd e: Oh , yeah . grad g: Yeah , I think phd f: Well , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . phd e: How happy were they ? professor d: I 'd probably search for something like that . postdoc h:  h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ? professor d: Now these we turn off "

        "Query": "Summarize the main points discussed in Marketing's presentation during the last meeting and the group's feedback on it.",
        "Summary": "The remote control should not only be small, easy to use, and eye-catching, but also have buttons with a soft feel and a trendy design, possibly incorporating fruit and vegetable elements. Marketing suggested incorporating one or two star features, such as speech recognition, to build the campaign around. The energy source for the remote should be a battery, and it was emphasized that the remote should be brought to the market before the competition. Marketing emphasized the importance of adopting the latest trends and fashion updates for the remote control, particularly for the targeted young users. This includes features like an LCD screen, vivid colors, and a cool shape. However, it was noted that the decisions made regarding the interface did not align with the desired look and feel. The team discussed the possibility of incorporating Bluetooth functionality, but ultimately decided against it. They also explored the idea of using squeezable rubber as an energy generator. Easy usability was another key point raised by Marketing, who suggested incorporating fruit-shaped buttons to align with the upcoming fashion trend. The Project Manager proposed marketing the control in different colors for different groups of people, similar to the iPod. During the evaluation process, Marketing expressed dissent regarding the financial aspects of the design, highlighting the need for further adjustments during budget control. The lack of information about prices led to unrealistic discussions about costly functions like recognition. Marketing believed that users would be interested in a speech recognizer to simplify program selection and reduce the number of buttons. The remote control should also be small and affordable. The team briefly considered lighting adapting options but ultimately left the decision to the Industrial Designer and User Interface designer. The team also discussed potential user-friendly features, including tracking devices to recognize personal preferences and a voice activator to help locate the remote. However, due to budget constraints, these ideas were set aside. The Industrial Designer mentioned the importance of considering repetitive strain injury (RSI) in the ergonomic design process and suggested using touch buttons instead of press buttons to mitigate this issue.",
        "Article": "Then  I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you  a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by  our two colleagues that make good work . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And  then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . And  end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . project manager: d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say  to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped  case with  a rubber material around it industrial designer: project manager: to be  to feel spongy , user interface: Like a banana . project manager: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can  we can continue with this product  as if , marketing: project manager: and we are now going to see the project evaluation with  our marketing expert . marketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about  during the previous  meetings . marketing: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and  according to what you think about the this project you can   make a one point , two point or seven point . marketing: The okay ?  so  fancy look and feel , what do you think ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Do you vote  Christine ? marketing: eh ? user interface: Do you also vote ? marketing: No , I just want to see something project manager: Maybe we all have to agree on a common user interface: Well , we can very easily . So user interface: marketing: Need to project manager: this is your marketing:  I don't know if you we ha we have to put  one  f If it's better or project manager: One is most . project manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? marketing: Six  s you can how much what ? project manager: How much would you you don't answer to this  questionnaire ? marketing: Oh yes I  I dunno  , I think six , it's a good  user interface: So it will have five point five average . project manager: Four ? industrial designer: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . I I user interface: D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? project manager: No . project manager: Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? marketing: We can put four ? user interface: Yeah . Is it fashion ? project manager: Oh yeah , user interface: project manager: its its f its fruit fruit shape . marketing: Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , user interface: Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . marketing: We have the lightning , or project manager: Yeah , we have the marketing: The lighting . project manager: we don't sesh especially have the lightning user interface: So you'll make the material transparent project manager: but marketing: user interface: so that it  lights up completely , or project manager: So it's yellow . project manager: I think it's very easy to marketing: Seven ? project manager: I would say seven . marketing: Is it is it robust ? project manager: Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , industrial designer:  f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . user interface: Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , project manager: Yeah . user interface: I don't know project manager: But it is  it is surrounded by rubber material .  if we say that seven it's  it's the better , project manager: Yeah , the be . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , the top marketing: and when  s six sit six are good it's a good  p product , I think . user interface: Because I saw  some phones that were banana shaped ,  wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , marketing: project manager: Yeah . user interface:  quite big also , marketing: user interface: and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . project manager: I think the industrial designer: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . user interface: it's much more complex , but project manager: So , I think , we can summarise . We we have the cost below  our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . marketing: project manager: So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now  open champagne and make a huge party . user interface: project manager: I don't know if it's provided by  by the meeting staff . user interface: So what does the management say ? project manager: Sorry ? user interface: What does the management say ? project manager: I think we will have  much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well "

        "Query": "What were Barry Hughes' thoughts on the legal framework, infrastructure of out-of-court disposals, targets for performance measures, and the registration of grandparents in relation to the childcare offer?",
        "Summary": "Barry Hughes believed that implementing a clear legal framework would provide clarity for parents and professionals, but there was confusion and ambiguity when it came to prosecution, leading to some cases falling into grey areas. He also suggested that the infrastructure for out-of-court disposals could be developed by the Welsh Government, the police, and crime commissioners. Barry clarified that they did not have specific targets for prosecution, but only pursued cases with reasonable prospects. Similarly, the police no longer had targets, except for certain individuals. Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the focus on registered licensed providers for the childcare offer, aiming for higher quality and a broader range of services compared to individual childcare. However, it was noted that some grandparents who were registered, licensed, and inspected also cared for their grandchildren and other children in small groups.",
        "Article": "Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands, and how do you think the law as it currently stands today, and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment\u2014how does that protect children. barry hughes: Sorry, can I just be clear? How does the law as it presently stands protect children? sian gwenllian am: Yes. barry hughes: We have a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, does provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. In respect of children in particular, you'll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. sian gwenllian am: Well, a review was undertaken by the Government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form\u2014that that would be the best thing to do because there's no evidence that it's not working satisfactorily. You are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that's happened since 2007. barry hughes: I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that. We don't need to go back a very long way to find, for example, that there was no such offence as raping one's married wife, and the law has changed to reflect the fact that that is simply not acceptable. And from what I've seen of the research, and I think back to the 2007 review, to which you've just referred, there is evidence within that review already that opinions are changing. And I've seen research more current than that that suggests that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastising a child than do people of an older generation. Of course, as we move forward in time, the people who are young now are going to be the older adults of the future. We have heard evidence as a committee that this proposed law would provide a much clearer legal framework\u2014that is, to take out this reasonable punishment defence, that then would make things much clearer for parents and professionals. Does the CPS have a view on that? barry hughes: I think it will make things clearer. I'm not sure it will make them much clearer, because if we get into some of the\u2014. And when it comes to prosecuting, it's often the case that things aren't just black and white; there are multiple shades of grey in between. We know that the Children Act did introduce a degree of clarity, in that it removed the defence of reasonable chastisement for offences of causing actual bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and various incidents of child cruelty under the Children and Young Persons Act. There were a series of Court of Appeal cases that sought to clarify the law, but that was at a time, at the end of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, when we had the European convention on human rights and we had a quickly developing body of case law. A decision was clearly made back then in the early 2000s not to include common assault in the same category as actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm et cetera. As we wind forward some 15 years, I have seen the research that suggests that some people see that the present legislation, and the way in which section 58 applies to reasonable chastisement for common assault of children\u2014some people have interpreted that as saying that smacking is acceptable. I don't think that it is what it says, but there is a degree of confusion around that. And the reason why I say it's not as simple as that is, going back to my words a couple of minutes ago, it's rarely a case of being black and white; there are these degrees of grey. sian gwenllian am: What are the areas of grey that you refer to? Can you give a few examples? barry hughes: If you take an example\u2014so, one of the examples that I've heard discussed has been a child\u2014a young child; let's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road\u2014who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic. Now, technically, taking hold of the child at that point is an assault, because it's an unwanted imposition of physical force. But no-one's going to say that's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts. At that point, the parent then seeks to admonish the child, tells them off and smacks the child on the legs. But so much depends upon the circumstances, whether this is something that happens frequently with the child, the size of the child, the parent, the force of the slap, the way in which it's imposed. As we move towards the other end of the spectrum, we might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. There'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police, and the police would take some form of action, and then, as we move through the tiers, it'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. And the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court. That would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that I've just described to you. Does that help to illustrate that, at one end, it's relatively white and the other end it's relatively black, but in the middle we have the shades of grey? sian gwenllian am: But that would mean that there could be more prosecutions at the softer end. So, you are probably aware, but forgive me if I just explain quickly anyway, when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is\u2014. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case\u2014the light smacking on the leg\u2014at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think\u2014and I think this is what will probably happen in practice\u2014that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. It may be that the police decide that it is\u2014it may have been two smacks, three smacks, so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious. We would then apply independently the same test, and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists, which takes us on to considering the public interest. In the circumstances that I've described, every case is going to be unique on its own facts, but in the circumstances that I've described, if it is just a light smack and it's a one-off and there's no history of this, it would probably be the sort of offence we'd decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. sian gwenllian am: But isn't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that? Do you know what I'm saying? barry hughes: If this Bill goes through, then it will remove a defence, which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the CPS than beforehand, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will refer it, because it will depend on the facts of each individual case. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in England and Wales from Dawn Bowden. The Assembly doesn't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the CPS, as you know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that? barry hughes: Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this\u2014and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing\u2014that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. The second example that I'll give you is that we already have within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example I'll give to you is this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 \u00b5g in 100 ml of breath. As you drive into Scotland, you're probably okay to drive if you've got 34 \u00b5g; by the time you get into Scotland, you won't be. And the consequences for you are significant, because of course it's an offence in Scotland, and not an offence in England, but the punishment, namely disqualification, applies everywhere in the United Kingdom. So, we already have a degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognises this. In our code, we have a specific provision that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that? barry hughes: Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, we would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences\u2014and we might want to get into the number of potential offences, but my take on it is the number of offences is likely to be very small and we would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that comes through goes to people who've got a close network and can talk with each other\u2014 dawn bowden am: And that would be primarily around the public interest issue. So you're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications. What's actually been your involvement with the Government as they've been developing this legislation? barry hughes: My own personal involvement? dawn bowden am: Or the service's. I met with a Minister and a Deputy Minister\u2014I met with Huw Irranca-Davies a little while ago, and I met with Julie Morgan a few months ago\u2014to discuss the overall implications, and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other. It hasn't been a very close-knit involvement, but we have had enough involvement so that we've felt we've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation. I don't feel that it's been too much, nor do I feel we've been left on the side at all. Now, we've just talked about the divergence of criminal law, and this is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance. barry hughes: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that. dawn bowden am: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales\u2014well, and in England, actually, across the border\u2014will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law? barry hughes: Not as of the present day. [Laughter.] dawn bowden am: But you would expect that to be something you would\u2014 barry hughes: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes? barry hughes: They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that. Oh no, that's right\u2014obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers\u00a0of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision? barry hughes: I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. What we would envisage is that we would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which are set out, in my view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and we would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that we're discussing here. And we'd need to work that up as we go along, and I think you'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse, if I may put it like that. suzy davies am: It's just that, personally, I think the public interest test is critical in all this, and it would really help us to understand what it could look like before we commit to a particular course of action in supporting or not supporting the Bill, that was all. sian gwenllian am: My point is about the criminal law in Wales and England diverging in this particular instance, and we've been told that this is probably the first time it's happened. Can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion? barry hughes: There are other offences in Wales that don't exist in England, but they don't crop up very often. So, to give you examples, there is an offence of putting an electronic collar on your pet\u2014let's not stretch that into children. But putting an electronic collar on your pet that administers a shock is an offence in Wales; it's not an offence in England. There are also offences around the picking of cockles in west Wales, which is not an offence\u2014. So, you can see there are some, but I would argue that the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England is possibly more significant for the general public. Of course, the topic we're discussing here is of real relevance for the general public, and you have heard evidence, I know, already, that comes from people who are quite strongly in favour and people quite strongly against it. One of the ways in which I've approached this is looking at it from the perspective of what the law is there for, which is to set out, in essence, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to use the law for that, but it signifies how society views a certain behaviour. I like to look at it from the perspective of the person who is being affected by this, namely the child, and the change in the law here would afford children a degree of protection that they don't presently have, but which they do have when they attain the age of 16.FootnoteLink So, I looked at this\u2014. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying\u2014but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. sian gwenllian am: Do you think that what we're doing in Wales will be emulated in England at some point? barry hughes: Well, it's certainly going through in parallel in Scotland, and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this, including a large number of European countries. Who knows? Trying to get any legislation through Westminster at the moment\u2014who knows? Not tomorrow, I'd say. Can I just begin by asking you to help the committee out here in understanding how the burden of proof is going to work if this defence is removed? Because the issue of whether something is punishment or not is going to disappear, providing that it's clear that contact with a child has happened. Is that going to work on the presumption that that's an unlawful contact? Is that something the prosecution will still have to prove, or will it be for an accused parent to say, to use your example, 'I was just dragging them out of the traffic or stopping them putting their hands in the fire'? barry hughes: I understand your point. So, if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement, in a sense that alters some things but it doesn't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution, which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And if the defence raise an argument and say, 'Well, look, that was a lawful act; I was only doing what I thought was reasonable in the circumstances', it's for the Crown to disprove that. barry hughes: And we've got to disprove that to the criminal standard, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. I can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter, to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial, and it would be our responsibility to disprove that. Obviously, when we're talking about CPS guidelines and all the rest, we've already come some distance down the process, haven't we? Have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest? Because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you're arrested, that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like DBS checks in the future, even if it goes no further. Do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on, even at the point of the knock at the door? barry hughes: From the perspective of the CPS, I'm not sure I can help you there. Unlike in many other jurisdictions, we have no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decide not to investigate\u2014. I routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something, and they want us to do something about it and we can't. suzy davies am: Thank you for that, because I thought that was important to get on the record as well. We're looking at a period of a couple of years after this Act passes\u2014if it does\u2014for implementation. Is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law? barry hughes: I think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we've built up with the Welsh Government and colleagues there. We have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and I believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected; that we can liaise, in turn, with Kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop. So, I think we've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose\u2014at least, 'adequate' might sound a little\u2014 suzy davies am: Sufficient. suzy davies am: So, you're confident, by 2022, then, that you'll have changes to the CPS guidelines that are good to go, if you like. Bear with me a second\u2014thank you very much\u2014in your written evidence, you did welcome the indication from the Welsh Government that this reasonable period after Royal Assent would be necessary. Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this? barry hughes: If this legislation goes through, there will be minor financial consequences for us and I don't see any significant financial consequences in the period between now and the Bill becoming law other than the time of ourselves in discussing this today. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will\u2014. Normally, we do this through our case management system, which is England-and-Wales wide, and you'd put a flag on. So, for example, domestic abuse, there's a flag for that, and assault on a child, there's a flag for that. Trying to get that through on a system that covers all of England and Wales\u2014it's quite expensive, unbelievably; it wouldn't happen. My take on it: I've seen and spoken with Matt Jukes about this, from South Wales Police; I have seen the justice impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever\u201412, 18 months, maybe 24 months\u2014where we'd look back to see how we are doing. And I'd like to think that we will be doing that in consultation with interested parties and stakeholders. So, for offences such as racially aggravated offending, whether it's criminal damage or offence against the person, we will bring together interested parties, by which  people from outside the CPS, quite often third sector agencies that represent vulnerable groups. That, in turn, helps us shape and improve the way that we prosecute these cases and I can foresee that, after this legislation came in, we might get 18 months, two years down the road, and I can see us sitting in a room with some of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how we're doing with it all. suzy davies am: That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example\u2014the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children. lynne neagle am: Before we move on, can I just ask\u2014? The Children Act 2004 applies to a child up to the age of 18\u2014 barry hughes: Sixteen. barry hughes: I'm reasonably confident that it's 16.FootnoteLink lynne neagle am: Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill? barry hughes: Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted. vikki howells am: Thank you, that's really useful, and\u2014 lynne neagle am: Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution? barry hughes: Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed. There is a body of law that\u2014 suzy davies am: A child can't consent to assault. barry hughes: Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option? barry hughes: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say\u2014for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth\u2014we\u00a0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering\u00a0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility\u2014that will fall to the police\u2014but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. One final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this Bill\u2014how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited? barry hughes: The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved\u2014the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction. vikki howells am: And who would build that infrastructure, in your opinion? barry hughes: Somewhere within Wales\u2014Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales? barry hughes: I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example? barry hughes: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here\u2014by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes\u2014if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it. sian gwenllian am: Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. It may be\u2014the sort of circumstance I can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'Prosecute me'. So, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in England\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. And do you think that that would be an isolated incident? barry hughes: Yes, truly, I believe, an isolated incident. I've said before that I would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures? barry hughes: I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets\u2014it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean. sian gwenllian am: What about\u2014? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence? barry hughes: I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. Is that going to increase if we change the law? barry hughes: There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication. sian gwenllian am: Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law? barry hughes: No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. sian gwenllian am: Finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point. How to approach that one? In the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the Government, the then Government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the European convention. If Wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, Wales would be more in compliance with ECHR than not, and England would be less so. But nonetheless, at present, I haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case I referred to, Regina v H, which was heard back in 2001 in the Court of Appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. sian gwenllian am: And that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the UK\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the European Union. barry hughes: It could, but I would be a foolish man if I were to say what impact European jurisprudence might have upon us. [Laughter.] suzy davies am: [Inaudible.]\u2014like common law jurisdictions would be. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the Bill will be of great significance to the Crown Prosecution Service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. So, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. What's your answer to that? barry hughes: There is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and I think probably about\u2014. From memory\u2014please never hold me to this\u2014but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. I've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant\u2014what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything\u2014that would be a nonsense\u2014or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. And then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise? barry hughes: No. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and I know that the Ministry of Justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. So, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, I don't think it would be a barrier. I think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it. Can I thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers, which have been fascinating and very clear and most helpful to the committee? You will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Business Committee requesting an extension on the deadline for the Bill, which has now been agreed. Paper to note 2 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services requesting some further information from CAFCASS Cymru on the Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Minister for Education regarding Diamond reform implementation ahead of our scrutiny session on 4 July. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "Summary": "The group discussed pricing the remote control at 25 euros, which was considered relatively high compared to existing options. To avoid losing potential consumers, the Project Manager decided to position the product as a universal remote control with unique features to attract more consumers and meet profit expectations. User Interface suggested designing symbols and colors for the remote, but the Project Manager emphasized the need to incorporate their own logo and color scheme. Marketing proposed self-intuitive buttons for game players, with Industrial Designer preferring a game control keypad over separate buttons. The Project Manager agreed, as keypads were common and user-friendly, allowing for easier navigation and joystick functionality. The shape of the remote was debated, with Marketing and User Interface suggesting an iPod square or a more innovative round shape. The Project Manager opted for a round shape with rounded corners to promote innovation. The idea of a multifunctional remote control was met with concerns about size and complexity. To address this, a touch screen remote control was proposed as a feasible solution.",

B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "Query": "What were the reasons for Marketing's disagreement with the Project Manager and Industrial Design regarding the technical functions, advanced techniques, and touch screen of the new remote control, considering the budget limitations?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager recognized the importance of targeting customers below the age of forty, as they have specific needs that should be addressed. However, Marketing disagreed and suggested that the project should cater to a larger group of people, rather than just those under forty. The Industrial Design team proposed incorporating advanced techniques, such as a touchscreen, to make the remote control more unique. Despite the advantages of a touchscreen, such as making the remote control smaller and easier to use, Marketing rejected the idea due to budget constraints. In order to balance cost and functionality, the Project Manager suggested giving up voice recognition and keeping the touchscreen. However, Marketing's research showed that interviewees had a strong preference for voice recognition, even when they were not informed about the touchscreen. Therefore, Marketing insisted on keeping voice recognition to cater to popular demand. The Industrial Designer believed that it was impossible to create a universal remote control that could accommodate different TV brands, as each brand has its own remote control. However, Marketing believed that this issue could be solved by developing a universal remote control with a code.",

And what you're  drawing ? user interface:  sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer . So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and  we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about  this project and the the project initiation . First of all I want to ask  Mister Ed about your  marketing plan and your product plan and  marketing: Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . project manager: - but  do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or marketing:  for the moment not yet . project manager: Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but  what's what's your  do you have some project plan , something with you or marketing: Good question . No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . Okay , so  by when you think you can  give me some kind of  project plan , okay , a discussion with  marketing: Certainly by the next meeting .  Okay , so there's any questions or  first of all about  this project ? industrial designer: What is the goal of the project ? project manager:  the goal of the project I think maybe I'll  hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain  what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . We have to define exactly what our product is , from  project manager: Yes , so can you explain  what exactly the product is ? marketing: From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ? project manager: Oh I think  , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so project manager: Yes . marketing: Something  visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , project manager: marketing: because I think everybody's experienced with  remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth  throwing out the window .  th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , project manager: marketing: 'cause a lot of times  spend  half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . project manager: And  what abo  Christine , what about your  the industrial design plan ? Are you have a design already on this product or  you're still working on the design ? industrial designer:  no , I I have not begun working on the design , project manager: industrial designer: and  I  I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor .  the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a   some sort of a seven inch  monitor , and  I understood that that was the project goal . So  I'm glad I didn't d do any work  ahead of time because  I clearly didn't understand the project goal . industrial designer:  I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and  that's about  that's project manager: industrial designer: and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . project manager: So  you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? industrial designer:  for the industrial design ? project manager: Yes . marketing: project manager: That's industrial designer:  because  , you know , you can  you can make it  you have different choices with different financial models . project manager: Yeah , but  before we talk about  the finance , okay ,  do you have some idea how we can  sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and  of course it's to the individual also . industrial designer: Well , you know  , I kind of think that in general you have to do   y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's  very attractive that  people see and recognize  its goal , and  they immediately wanna have it  have one of their own . So it would really would need to  something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , project manager: industrial designer: so  d  you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . project manager: Okay , but   when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? industrial designer: Well ,  I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now  and so I'll have to wait and see how those  how those go . project manager: Yeah , but  I need something in the writing , so like  what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and  how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe  initial budget you're looking , okay , and  how is going to the market , okay , industrial designer: project manager: so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and  you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of   the plan in the writing from you . Okay , and it's po industrial designer: And when would you like that ? project manager: B as soon as possible . industrial designer:  well if  if we have enough time  then d do you think  two weeks is a is close enough ? project manager: Yes I think  that would be good , because I need to go to the management and  tell them what we are going to do , and  what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because  without any  documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need  some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . industrial designer:  are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? project manager: Yes , of course , if you need some help ,  so let me know . So , who are the people you need  from the marketing or  the technical side or  the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , industrial designer: project manager: so just let me know so I can  coordinate all the teams . And  Ed  so what's what do you think about  this  project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or  the sales strategy ? marketing: Well not yet other than  doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do  , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , project manager:  . marketing: It should be a fairly large market because  the number of people that  the competition , project manager: marketing:  th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . project manager: Yes , so what I  prefer maybe  you need to interact  more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because  she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , marketing: Yeah . project manager: so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . project manager: So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and  within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , marketing: project manager: and  you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , th marketing: Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much  we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , project manager: Th That that's marketing: that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? project manager: Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you  both of  the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then  we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , so I think it's  maybe if we can  give me some kind of your  the sales plan , okay , including the technical what  she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . Okay , and if you need  any coordination in between  compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some   marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .  my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . user interface: So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , project manager: Th Christine , yeah . Which is user interface: and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , user interface: Yeah . project manager: then you will user interface: Which will also feed into the marketing , project manager: Yes . user interface: because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .  , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account . But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your  meeting and Christine meeting , because  he should know what's happening . Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management . user interface: So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or project manager: Yes . To come up with the functional design and  to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and  first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , user interface: industrial designer: Would you mind  at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? project manager: Yes , I will . project manager: I'll copy ,  le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ? user interface: Sure . project manager: And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or  just come and  knock my door , okay , so I'm available here "

        "Query": "What was the final decision regarding the chip, feasibility of letting the user program the keys, and fulfilling user requirements?",
        "Summary": "The group made a decision to use a regular-style chip without an LCD display for the controller, opting for simple push buttons with the exception of a more advanced button for the interior lighting system. Concerns were raised by the industrial designer regarding the usability of the function, as it went against the product requirements. The user interface designer suggested that the usability would depend on the user's effort, leading to the decision to produce two versions of the controller - one with full user freedom and the other with some constraints. In order to meet the requirements of being fashionable and spongy, the group agreed to use wood and rubber for the controller. The buttons, which would be the part touched by users, would be made of rubber, while the rest of the controller would be made of wood to provide a natural feel.",
        "Article": "So , we will first start by summarizing the  the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .  I will take notes during this meeting so  that you can  look at my  folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . We'll then t take decision in concert and then   we will  define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . We have also  the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ user interface: Abdul al-Hasred is my name . industrial designer: I_D_ you want ? project manager: Maybe I can switch slide  on your request . industrial designer: and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the  the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a  a wheel control . So   I was looking basically for that chip , which is  very very standard , and  I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . industrial designer: And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . Yeah project manager: So will will will this with  including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be  lower than twelve Euros to produce ? industrial designer: I I th But I don't think that  we should We should talk about  the design of the box also which needs some money . project manager: Okay user interface: Also have to say industrial designer: But user interface: Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? industrial designer:  that's all user interface: No ? project manager: You received something industrial designer: yeah . But I guess it could be project manager: And could it be adapted ? user interface: I guess it's possible . project manager: Okay and there can  recognize some commands and stuff ? user interface: Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as  as a chip project manager: Okay . project manager: Okay maybe we can just  listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . industrial designer: Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry , I haven't written my personal references .  the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , project manager: Okay .  , what is the purpose of the light ? industrial designer: Just to to make something which is  slightly more design that  a squarey box with a rubber user interface: Is project manager: You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? user interface: But But in th in the dark  Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? project manager: It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ? user interface: But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . user interface: But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . industrial designer: I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but  the bill starts to be user interface: Okay . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , industrial designer: First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light user interface: yeah . industrial designer: and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device user interface:  . project manager: But it can be  battery consuming , no ? To have the light always on ? industrial designer: Yeah , a little bit . user interface: So I just look at some current designs  on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because  th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just  reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . project manager: And also does it  fit well in hand ? Because it was  th your wrist problem with the usage . We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . user interface: So , from the bottom or whatever is there ,  the  the numbers and then the top ,  until the ten also , this middle part , project manager: Yeah . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . user interface: Yeah , if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . Will be down or user interface: So that they're separate a bit , project manager: Okay .  and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but  , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t  tuning the channels and stuff like that . user interface: We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . user interface:  so we could just basically use one just wheel and  user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . So we can move to the Is there any question ? For designer of user interface ? or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? Okay . marketing: Can I ? So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control  . So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . marketing: And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends ,  fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form project manager: Okay . project manager: marketing:  I don't know which material can be spongy , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and if you project manager: This is good also for user interface: Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , industrial designer: Yeah . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is  technological innovative , and after the easy to use . marketing: Yeah that's why project manager: Has it ? marketing: Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand project manager: Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well . D D Is is there anything you want to add ? user interface: Is there any fruit that is spongy ? marketing: project manager: I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . industrial designer: And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ? project manager: But that's not in the trend . user interface: You can make it  marketing: project manager: The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . marketing: project manager: I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . project manager: So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's  easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit  any others idea you have . What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? marketing: user interface:  . industrial designer: You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , user interface: Two of the button , yeah . industrial designer: but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and here you have a a push button to marketing: But you don't have project manager: I think it's a good idea , yeah . user interface: Yeah so you can just have  just have this curve , yeah , and you move  your hand here to press the buttons and then you move  on the other side . user interface: So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool , project manager: Yeah . user interface: no ? project manager: I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . industrial designer: If you if you start with  fancy fruits and fra s and tha user interface: Ah-ha . industrial designer: Oh , yeah marketing: project manager: Yeah it's really  really a good point . marketing: user interface: Now who are recording this meeting ? project manager: I think it So One second . So ,  so for marketing: project manager: sorry , for  component , so industrial designer: So project manager: we have to think about those aspects , sorry .  what do you mean by case ? project manager: I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . project manager: industrial designer: I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . user interface: But  the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be industrial designer: Spongy also . user interface:  if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to  if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot . user interface: So if we try to push the buttons , it project manager: No the button would be user interface: You think it's possible ? project manager: In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . Button , where do we want some buttons ? user interface: Well , usually hold 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ? industrial designer: Yeah . Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is  yeah also the thumb . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . user interface: This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? project manager: Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . user interface: So if the left , we have the op project manager: I think you can turn it this way also . user interface: Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . project manager: And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . user interface: So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know , but  if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . project manager: So , for interface we said also that we have  this banana shape with button on the s on the side . I think it's  we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah . That is to say ,  check if it fit the the requirement  given by the users , but according to  your presentation it seems to be okay . project manager: So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer  work together . project manager: You feel  free to express what you want to say ? You don't feel too constrained ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: user interface: Maybe you can make    project manager: Okay , so user interface: okay "

        "Summary": "The group reached a consensus on the features of the new remote control, including the use of normal batteries, a scroll wheel with rubber buttons and backlights, a round shape, and speech recognition with an advanced chip. They decided to forgo an LCD display due to cost constraints. Marketing initially suggested developing a multi-functional remote control that could control various appliances, but ultimately decided to design it solely for television use. The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of a modern remote control being able to control a diverse range of equipment, which was agreed upon by the User Interface team. The group evaluated the remote control design based on user requirements and received a satisfactory average score of two. Marketing raised concerns about the ease of finding all the buttons, particularly the options button, while the Industrial Designer believed all the buttons were easier to find than a regular remote control. The team discussed the inclusion of a standard wheel, despite its higher cost, and debated whether to include a motion-activated light or continuous light.",
        "Article": "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "Summary": "The team discussed the best approach for incorporating the recording infrastructure in the room, considering options such as placing tapes in the lip of the table and using LEDs to indicate when the channel is live. Power issues were also a topic of discussion. In terms of representing the Bayes-net, an alternative approach was proposed that depicts context features as classes and their dependencies as relations. This model allows for instantiations of classes, which aligns better with the research objectives compared to the extended belief-net. Recent experiments revealed that adding more languages had a detrimental effect on model performance. However, it was noted that any form of normalization had a positive impact, while MSG had no effect. A demonstration was given on the structure and function of a toy version of the belief-net for the intentionality task. The feature nodes included prosody, discourse, verb choice, the \"landmark-iness\" of a building, time of day, and whether the admission fee was discussed.",

How was your business trip to Boston ? project manager:  well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: You have the same message of  Windows cannot  marketing: user interface: sen oh stand-by . user interface: project manager:  I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .  Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here  in the role of Industrial Designer . project manager:  we're going to do    a little tool training  for the tools we are going to use  during  the meetings we are going to have here .  then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,  and we will have a discussion .  is there any room for a little presentation ?  maybe during the discussion  section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it "

        "Summary": "The marketing team highlighted three important trends: the desire for fancy and identifiable products, the need for technological innovation, and the importance of ease of use. Additionally, they noted that fruit and vegetable themes were popular, and the idea of a spongy texture was well-received. The group agreed that the remote control should resemble fruit and vegetables in shape and color, but the specific design was not yet determined. The industrial designer proposed two options: a titanium material with a fruity scent or a spongy and fruity-like material. However, the project manager stated that they couldn't have both options and suggested painting the controller to mimic titanium instead. The final decision was not made. The user interface designer suggested a red and yellow color scheme and two basic shapes, a circle and a triangle, referred to as the mushroom design. However, the marketing team disagreed with the mushroom design and decided to change it to a pineapple shape. The group decided to produce a mid-sized remote control with various components such as a printed circuit board, chip, transistor, scroll wheel, power cradle, locator, radio transmitter, antenna, speaker, double curves, LEDs, and buttons. The casing material would be a combination of rubber and plastic. Based on previous experiments and questionnaires, the marketing team found that most users considered remote controls to be ugly. Therefore, the group aimed to create a fancy-looking product to justify a higher price. However, determining what constitutes \"fancy\" was challenging due to differing opinions. The project manager agreed that the product should be visually appealing but cautioned against using too many colors to avoid increasing costs. Additionally, the project manager suggested incorporating an image that represents society on the remote control for easy recognition.",
        "Article": "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "Summary": "The team reached a consensus that the remote control should have a waterproof design and be baby-proof to prevent any accidents. It was also agreed that the remote should have voice control functionality for children who may not be tall enough to operate it manually. Additionally, a child lock feature was deemed necessary. The group acknowledged the benefits of using a kinetic battery, but cost and reliability were concerns compared to a regular battery. They suggested using a cheaper chip to balance out the cost of the kinetic battery technology. The User Interface team expressed difficulty in keeping the remote small with a wood case, as the Industrial Designer believed it would be prone to breakage. The Project Manager proposed using rubber or plastic instead, considering practicality and ease of cleaning. The idea of creating fruit or vegetable-shaped remotes was discussed, with the understanding that only the exterior shape would change while the PCB remained the same. The team also considered offering customers customizable skins.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

They were also developing tools to extract information from XML files using Java and Perl. The transcriber pool has been meeting expectations in terms of work completed within the allocated time. Grad D explained the importance of combining different experts in the network to adapt to various situations, suggesting dividing the network into parts and allowing it to determine which experts to trust in each situation. The transcriber pool is making good progress and may be utilized for other coding tasks in the future, such as analyzing speaker overlap.

Yeah . phd f: and we get the transcript back and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , then  we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch , postdoc a: Excellent . grad h: And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ? phd f: Yes , exactly . phd f: We 're sort of doing things in parallel , that way we can get as much done a at once . grad h: Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it , phd f: Yeah . grad h: Right , which  So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , so the front - end is the user interface and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for  conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it , do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting , phd f: What what kind of  what does that look like ? The string that you type in . phd f: What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ? grad h: Keywords . grad h: Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything . professor b: And then does it play something back or that 's something you 're having to program ? grad h: right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools , professor b: Yeah . grad h: but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? We have two tools that have already been written . grad h:  the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: I Can I ask a question ? So  as it stands within the the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play . So e Are you So you 're adding like  , I don't know ,  are they fuzzy matches or are they  ? grad h: It 's a sort of standard , text - retrieval - based So it 's  term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring . grad h:  and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that . So it it 's postdoc a: It 's a lot more sophisticated than the  the basically Windows - based grad h: i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that . grad h: So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents . Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search . grad h:  you have to do preindexing and so that these tools do all that . And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it well  to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings . grad h: So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that . phd f: So what does the user see as the result of the query ? grad h: On which tool ? phd f: THISL . grad h: The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK phd f: Yeah . grad h:  you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits and you can type on them and listen to them . professor b: Mmm phd f: So if you typed in \" small heads \" or something you could grad h: Right , you 'd get phd f: get back a   something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred grad h: something You you 'd get to listen to \" beep \" . It 's too bad that that couldn't come into the grad h: You couldn't get a video . phd g: Guess who I practice on ? postdoc a: At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , that keeps coming up . Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable  demo sort of format . grad h: And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally phd f: That sounds really neat . grad h: and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .  Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I 'll work with him on it . And it it 's looking pretty good , you know , the fact that I got the query system working . grad h: If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's  , I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . phd f: But you were saying that that the  that there 's that set of tools , Cygnus tools , that grad h: So . grad h: But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer , professor b:   phd f: And you have to have all the o grad h: But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't and  different compiler work - arounds and so on . So the fact that  it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows . professor b: How about having it run under free BSD ? phd e: Well what you need grad h: Free BSD would probably be easier . phd e: All you need to do is say to Dan \" gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf \" and it 'll be done in a day . phd d:  phd e: Right ? grad h: Actually you know I should check because he did port it to SPRACHcore phd e: Right . professor b: So grad h: I 'll check at that professor b: But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . phd e: What I phd f: How does it play ? grad h: Yeah , right . professor b: If he has then you learn , if he hasn't then he 'll do it . So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with   , SoftSound guy ,  postdoc a: It 's amazing . professor b: Tony Robinson ? phd f: Tony Robinson ? grad h: Do  Tony ? I guess I do . grad h: Which one do  ? phd e: Steve Renals is not SoftSound , is he ? professor b: No . grad h: so that 's all going pretty well , professor b: Assuming we 're phd e: Right . phd f: What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ? grad h: I think we 'll be OK with that . phd e: Why don't you try and merge Transcriber and THISL IR ? They 're both Tcl interfaces . grad h: Well this is one of the reasons This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have  Dave Gelbart Gelbart Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff phd e: Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality and it 's grad h: Yeah , yeah , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack . Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts  eh you know , from speaker to speaker . grad h: And if it doesn't phd e: Right ? Do you have you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ? grad h: Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so . It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about and having the search tools and so on . grad h: but professor b: The thing I was asking about with , free BSD is that it might be easier to get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in grad h: Yeah ,  we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments , professor b: Yeah . grad h: so   My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . grad h: It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the \" include \" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different . grad h: So I it might be a little easier but it 's not gonna be a lot easier . So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , then we talked about  some other stuff which would basically be  showing off the the Transcriber interface itself and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , but but  ,  and part of that was showing off what the speech - non  nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like . postdoc a: Can I ask one more thing about THISL ? So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized  ? grad h:   phd g: So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody  work that Don 's been doing . phd g:  actually show some of the features and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries . professor b: Well I think at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that phd g: I don't know if that would be of interest or not . professor b: cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point phd g: Yeah . professor b: pointing at something I don't know much about , phd g: you 're looking at this now professor b: so . phd g: Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ? grad c:  yeah I 'm starting to and  Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on . phd g: Yeah def professor b: S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month phd g: I professor b: and then that 'll give us a week or so . The end of phd g: Oh , the end of this month or next month ? Oh , you mean like today ? grad h: This month . professor b:  that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to  to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , phd e: Exactly . phd g: Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's professor b: Yeah . phd g: cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our you know , the research , visualizing what these features are doing professor b: Yeah . professor b: so  , you know , to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . professor b: So that 's phd g: I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data so it might be neat , you know . So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools where you we 're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything and I think that 's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools . So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .  it works with Transcriber but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools  because it doesn't mark start and end .  , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files , either  information on users because the user database is that way I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m  various inf  sorted information on individual meetings grad c: Cool . And so l just let me know there it 's mostly Java and Perl but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable . Is do we have the the seat information ? In in the Key files now ? postdoc a:   grad h: The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which postdoc a: Ah . phd g: Oh in For the new one grad h: it 's been recorded , phd g: OK . phd g: I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? professor b: Yeah . phd f: how how w eh where is it in the Key file ? grad h: Right . phd g: Cuz  I haven't been putting it in and in by grad h: You haven't been putting it in . postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits ? professor b: Some of these are missing . phd g: And professor b: Aren't they ? postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits forms ? professor b: Some fall out of phd g: Well it grad h: Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . phd g:  they 're on th right , these , but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files . phd f: Yeah I I never phd g: And I don't think Chuck was either phd f: I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file . phd g: cuz grad h: I had told you guys about it phd f: Oh really ? phd g: Oh , so we 're both sorry . grad h: but phd g: So grad h:  this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text phd g: OK . grad h: I think it 's Edit - key , command Did I show you guys that ? phd d: Yep . phd f: You mentioned it , grad h: I did show it to you , phd f: yeah . grad h: but I think you both said \" no , you 'll just use text file \" . grad h: Yeah , and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings . grad c: u grad h: Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike , phd g: Yeah . phd g: maybe I forgot to d phd f: Takes me no time at all to edit these . grad h: Yeah that 's cuz you kn phd f: I 'm not doing anything . phd g: And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , \" oh what did Chuck do , OK I 'll do that \" . grad h: And then  also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under \" participants \" they were filled in under \" description \" . Oh  also I 'm working on another version of this tool , the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected . And it 's not quite ready to go yet because  it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . So I 'm working on that and it it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out . grad c: Will that also include like batteries dying ? Just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically . phd f: But with the screensaver kicking in , it phd d: But grad h: Now phd d: y yeah . grad h:  the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on the thing . postdoc a: It would be nice if if these had little light indicators , little L E Ds for grad h:  buzzer . grad h: \" Bamp , bamp ! \" professor b: Small shocks postdoc a: Yeah . Oh grad h: OK , disk backup , et cetera ?  I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and he pretty much said \" yeah , you could do that if you want \" but he thought it was a bad idea . In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing  NW archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . grad h: And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . professor b: Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . But he said that that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that , that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably OK . professor b: Really ? grad h: And  , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and  recording meetings . professor b: So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ? grad h: Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable . professor b: Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had  phd e: I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ? grad h:  unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain . grad h: Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure . And second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last . grad h: So I think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea . Can I add one top topic ? We have time ? I wanted to ask , I know that  that Thilo you were , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? And I wanted to know is th phd d: Yeah it 's it Basically it 's done , postdoc a: It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . grad h: Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work . phd d: Yeah it Yeah , it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but it 's solved . Does this mean that the that this could be por  ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of  phd d: Yeah , basically  I did install it on my laptop and yeah postdoc a: Wonderful . CrossPads ? CrossPads ? grad h:  got an email from  James Landay who basically said \" if you 're not using them , could you return them ? \" So he said he doesn't need them , he just periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them and asks them if they 're still using them . professor b: Once ? grad h: We we used them a couple times , postdoc a:   phd f: Them ? There 's more than one ? grad h: but postdoc a: Yeah . professor b: But grad h: My opinion on it is , first , I never take notes anyway so I 'm not gonna use it ,  and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with . postdoc a: And I have  so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the but I I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . I do take notes , I could be taking notes on these things and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings but I don't know . phd d: what is a CrossPad ? professor b: So it 's it 's  it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . grad h: And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things . grad h: But I don't take notes , professor b: And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because  we were interested in in higher - level things , grad h: so . professor b: not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? And  I think that was one of the things , phd d: Yeah . We 'll have a you know , have a scribe , have somebody  take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . And then we did it once or twice and we sort of grad h: Yep , and then just sort of died out . professor b: probably chose the wrong scribe but it was It 's  phd g:  grad h: Yeah that 's right . postdoc a: u but I guess the the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface . phd f:  we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ? postdoc a: Oh it 's la it 's useful , grad h: Because that 's summary . phd g: I think there 's also there 's this use that phd f: Summarize it from the transcription . phd g: the Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X and you don't wanna take notes and you 're you just wanna phd f: Doodle . phd g: get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you know , and and then while you 're bored you don't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X and But in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . I know we haven't been using it but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods grad h: Right . professor b: I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later phd g: so . professor b: and and and put some kind of summary or something  you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . But then you don't you don't have the time reference  that you 'd have if you had it live . And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , professor b: Yeah . phd f: How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ? phd g: so . grad h:  that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time phd g:  postdoc a:   grad h: You know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery postdoc a: Well when when I d grad h: and so you postdoc a: OK . grad h: so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information . phd e: Why grad h: And so there 's a lot of infrastructure which postdoc a: There is an alternative . grad h: unless someone postdoc a: There is an alternative , it 's still , there 's  you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . You c  , I when I when I did it I synchronized it by voice , by whispering \" one , two , three , four \" onto the microphone grad h:  . grad h: Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end phd e: Right . grad h: which someone has to listen to that and find that point , postdoc a: Yeah , it 's transcribed . phd g: Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? Would h  is there a big cau grad h: We can keep all both of them for the whole whole year . phd g: just just in case we grad h: it 's just phd g: even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate  f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out . professor b: Well one thing that we might try  is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . professor b:  part of the reason I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in  the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and grad h: Yep . professor b: and so forth so and and Jane is more into it but eh  you know I don't know if you wanna really do do this all the time so I think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . The p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with  quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to   routinely use it ,  it just hasn't happened anyway . But maybe if we can get a person to phd g: Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute . phd e: Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card . And and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the Linux server and  phd g: So what kind of input would you be ? phd e: so so , if you 're not worried about grad h: Buttons . phd g: You 'd just be pressing like a a phd e: Well well you have a PDA and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . phd e: if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go . grad h:  for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , phd g: M right . grad h: right ? You have the phd g: I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and postdoc a: I like this PDA idea . professor b: where like one one button was \"  - oh \" and then another button was \" that 's great \" and another button \" that 's f \" phd g: Or like this is my \" I 'm supposed to do this \" kind of button , postdoc a: Yeah . phd g: Yeah something like that or postdoc a: And then grad h:  I think the CrossPad idea is a good one . grad h: It 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work .  that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me phd g: Yeah . grad h: and postdoc a: But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too , phd g: W postdoc a: doesn't it ?  grad h: Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard . postdoc a: But  , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition , right ? professor b: No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , postdoc a: OK . postdoc a: I I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a  professor b: Right . You don't have to phd e: The transfer function is less errorful , postdoc a: Oh , nicely put . phd g: Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , right ? That 's why we have this little I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and so if we don't have to return it and we can keep it for a year I don't know . grad h: Well w we don't we certainly don't have to return it , as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . The point is that we haven't used it at all and are we going to ? professor b: So we have no but  by I I would suggest you return one . phd g: We c professor b: We have some aspirations of using them phd g: One would probably be fine . professor b: and phd g: Maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool .  if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more professor b: Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed . grad h: although there is a little phd g: Well , I 'm yeah , that 's not a bad professor b: Yeah , yeah . phd g: Jeremy 's gonna be an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , which sounds funny but I think it should be cool , professor b: Yeah . phd g: You 're you 're gonna tease me ? grad h: Oh , equipment . grad h: And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion so that  the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field . professor b: You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding ? \" We ordered more wireless . \" It 's like wires are the things so you 're wiring you 're you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing . phd g: I just it 's sort of a anachronism ,  it 's like It 's great . professor b:  there 's there 's all this stuff going on  between  Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs   recognition runs , trying to figure things out about the features but it 's it 's all sort of in process , so there 's not much to say right now . grad h: So just the transcript number and then the then the phd e: This is Yes , this is number two for me today . professor b: See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the phd e: Oh . grad h: Should we do simultaneous ? phd g: Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? professor b: Yeah . phd g: You have to plug your ears , by the way  Eric , grad h: Well I have to , phd d: You don't have to "

        "Summary": "To ensure accuracy, a small percentage of transcripts will be modified to correct any misread or uncorrected digits. In order to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags, a speaker database will be compiled. The initial test set of digits has been completed, consisting of 4,000 lines with each line containing 1-10 digits. To explore different prosodic groupings of numbers, new digit forms were distributed. The group also discussed new naming conventions to facilitate the sorting process. In order to standardize file names, existing files will be modified to have equal lengths. Similar changes will be made to speaker identification tags. Additionally, files will include information specifying the channel, microphone, and broadcaster details. PhD F suggested recording different meetings with the same group to aid in tasks like summarization, while Professor D advocated for random meeting participants to ensure diversity for acoustical research purposes.",

And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message and I have not yet sat down with been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code . professor d: So  so the  , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that  , we do the digit recordings at the end . And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's  meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , then they can run off . It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer  , sets of digits , but  , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , if someone 's on strict time  , less .  , so , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about  , the nature of the data that we are collecting .  @ @ that  , we should have a fair amount of data that is  , collected for the same meeting , so that we can ,  I don't know . Wh - what what were some of the points again about that ? Is it phd f: well , OK , I 'll back up . phd f: at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data and I I talked about this with Jane and Adam , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data  , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us , phd a: Well , great . phd f: And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , phd a: What a deal . grad b: And what 's he interested in , specifically ? phd f: So he 's comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody , grad b:   Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . phd f: But , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time grad b: One offs ? phd f: Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the ,  to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about .  it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . Then I was  , talking to Morgan about some new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to listen to . And in that  , regard , I thought we definitely w will need it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization . phd f: and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting . phd f: But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize , grad b: Yeah . phd f: but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . And then we need a couple that of We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar , grad b:   phd f: like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same . grad b:  professor d: Now , let l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I I don't disagree with that , but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . professor d: As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have  too few people from my point of view . So ,  I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and and  , phd c:   professor d: sure , if we can get more from them , fine , postdoc e:   professor d: but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people . postdoc e: Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . Because I think if you just say an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that that  , it would be useful for for purposes You know . postdoc e: But you know , I think I 've been I 've I I 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . And and the English you 'd have The language models would be really hard to build professor d: Well , you want to i postdoc e: because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a professor d: Well , OK , first place , I I I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I I think that 's what we 're investigating , postdoc e: OK . phd f: It has to be a a pre - existing meeting , like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . professor d: So I was I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors  , and and and  , senior  , d and  , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . The second point is  I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that postdoc e: Oh , oh . postdoc e: No , it 's more a matter of  , proficiency , e e just simply fluency . postdoc e: I deal with people on on campus who I think sometimes people , undergraduates  in computer science  , have language skills that make , you know that their their fluency and writing skills are not so strong . professor d: You 're just talking about postdoc e: Well , e I just think , grad b: We all had the same thought . postdoc e: but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , no problem . professor d: But grad b: Well , I think that ,  I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . And and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , I I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have  , g particularly good English skills . postdoc e: OK , now can I can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that  , there 's there 's this this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together . postdoc e: And if people want to approach  , i so I know e e You know this The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group , professor d:  - huh . postdoc e: but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking  , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data , professor d:   postdoc e: if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in  , i more fluent , more more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing . I postdoc e: Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have  , so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . If you have people who are using English as a as an interlanguage because they they don't  , they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , language model , professor d:  - huh . professor d: Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that professor d: I see . postdoc e: I I 'm I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a a grammar a grammar , basically , that  , wo would be a a possibility . postdoc e: So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , it seems like  , I don't see that there 's an argument professor d:   postdoc e: I 'm I what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , useful for the widest range of of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics . professor d: OK , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get .  , it it I think that if we 're aiming at at  , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK , postdoc e: Yes , that 's fine . And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population . grad b: Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one . professor d: Oh , you age - ist ! grad b: What 's that ? Well , age - ist . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a professor d: They 're they 're yeah , they 're d they 're  assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks . phd f: Cuz  , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? And and  , there there may be a lot more or or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could  , record people there . I think we 'd have a better chance grad b: I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . But if there were such a  it 's a remote possibility , then  , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . phd f: So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware . professor d: Well , the other thing Yeah ,  the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around .  , and grad b: Well , I know that space is really scarce on at least in CS . phd f: But you may not need a separate room , you know , grad b: That 's true . phd f: the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something grad b: True . professor d: Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something . grad b: Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . phd c: But I I I think you need , another portable thing a another portable equipment to to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI . phd c: Eh , if you you want to to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you you need It - it would be eh eh very difficult to to put , eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device . grad b: Yeah , but I think if we if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy . grad b: Right ? That 's very easy , phd c: Ye - Yeah , yeah . professor d: Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . We realized that , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . So , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , the way that you were speaking about with , not having an interlingua and  , these other issues . But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that 's , just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that 's OK too .  , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ?  , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . But what about For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone . phd f: Right , I c I think there 's grad b: And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean . phd f: Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone . postdoc e: Which one did you mean ? professor d: You d You don't ne it doesn't you just need some microphone , somewhere . professor d: but  phd f: use  , but I think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect , professor d: Yeah . phd f: you know , each person who 's interested in  , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . phd f: And So in my case , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . phd f: And so I 'm looking and thinking , \" Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . phd f: And other people need to do that for themselves , h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal professor d: Right . professor d: But I think that I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , \" Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , \" well maybe you don't . professor d: Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that 's good enough to get a  , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . professor d: we we could have a fairly We could just get a DAT machine and phd f: Well , I agree with Jane , though , on the other hand that phd c: Yeah . phd f: So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented . You may say well , \" Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . phd f: But what you what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on  Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . phd f: So I do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . phd f: Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose individual studies , so professor d:  but I I think that the  i We can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . professor d: And so ,  it took quite a while to get that together and to say , \" Oh , we 'll just do it up there , \" phd f: OK . professor d: If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o phd f: So then maybe we should try to bring people here . professor d: I think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here . phd f: that 's that 's OK , so professor d: We 're set up for it . phd f: Yeah , I And I think we can get people to come here , that But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down . professor d: Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food . professor d: Yeah grad b: Should I pursue that ? phd f: Oh , definitely , yeah . grad b: So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer , but I 'll send an email and ask . phd f: I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird grad b: Right . professor d: The the The oth the other h phd f: well , I know , I shouldn't say that . The o the o the other The other thing is , that we we talked about is give to them  , burn an extra CD - ROM . professor d: and give them So if they want a basically and audio record of their phd f: Well , I thought that was I thought he meant , \" Give them a music CD , \" like they g Then he said a CD of the of their speech professor d: Oh . phd f: and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , but You know , I personally would not want a CD of my meeting , grad b: Mmm . Of the meeting ? phd f: but maybe yeah , maybe you 're professor d: If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and  you 'd like phd f: right . professor d: We 're saying , \" Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you , grad b: Yep . professor d: but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless , phd f: Right . professor d: and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . phd a: What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ? postdoc e: Alth phd f: But we might need a little more to incentivize them , that 's all . postdoc e: I hav I have to  raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff , where maybe You know ? professor d: Good point . professor d: So we can so we can postdoc e: We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage . phd f: If It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically , grad b: That 's a good point . phd f: right ? professor d: Although it 's phd f: Otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone . postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right , say \" Yeah , well , I got this CD , and , Your Honor , I \" grad b: Yeah . So that was that topic , and then  , I guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question for grad b: We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have  enough sp room to record meetings . So I  did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving , I I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from  , Broadcast News . phd c: Eleven ? grad b: And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . phd a: Where did you copy it to ? grad b: Well , it 's Abbott . professor d: Sk - It 's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott ? grad b: Tape . phd a: Ah ! grad b: So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files . postdoc e: One thing The good news about that that is that once once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back . professor d: Is it ? postdoc e: it it it The other direction is fast , but this direction is really slow . phd a: Generating a clone ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's a good point . phd a: Oh ! Hunh ! professor d: S postdoc e: Now , what will  Is the plan to g to So stuff will be saved , it 's just that you 're relocating it ?  , so we 're gonna get more disk space ? Or did I ? grad b: No , the the these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable regeneratable postdoc e: OK . grad b: And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something . professor d: Or maybe six ? grad b: The SUN , ha  , takes more disks than the Andatico one did . The SUN rack takes Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . professor d: How many How much phd a: Is there a difference in price or something ? grad b: Well , what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices . I 've been looking at the , Aurora data and , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , SPINE . phd a: And so , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . So , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the CD - ROM type data , the the static data . So I moved that , and then  , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK . I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . professor d: So , but ,  y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , but are we g do we have some other other space now ? grad b: Yep . So , so , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , and that 's probably enough for about four meetings . phd a: OK , I but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we grad b: I don't remember . Yeah ,  we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand . And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , so , you know , we have a couple weeks .  , so , yeah , I think I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk . phd a: So should ,  One question I had for you was , we need we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk . Is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? grad b: We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . grad b: But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it . professor d: OK , @ @ So , then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what Jose has been doing , phd c:  - huh . professor d: so phd c: I have , eh , The result of my work during the last days . Eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the the Meeting Recording project . phd c: But for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh , here 's i is the demonstration of the overlap , eh , problem . phd c: It 's a real problem , a frequently problem  , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time . phd c: Eh , by a moment I have , eh , nnn , the , eh , n I I did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording , with eh , a exact mark . Oh , you did that by hand ? phd c: Heh ? That 's eh , yet b b Yeah , by b b by hand by hand because , eh , eh \" Why . \" grad b: Can I see that ? Can I get a copy ? professor d: Oh . phd c: My my idea is to work phd a: Wow ! phd c: I I I do I don I don't @ @ I don't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because I I I haven't a lot eh , enough time to to to work .  , only just eh , six months , as you know , but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . phd c: Eh but eh , eh , in my opinion , we need eh , eh , a reference eh session to t to to evaluate the the the tool . And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ? phd c: And No , no , with i grad b: Have you done that or are you planning to do that ? phd c: Sorry ? No , I I plan to do that . Darn ! phd c: I plan I plan , but eh , eh , the idea is the is the following . I I will I will eh , talk about eh , in the in the blackboard about the my ideas . phd c: Eh , eh This information eh , with eh , exactly time marks eh , for the overlapping zones eh overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker a a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone .  , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker without any any eh , noise eh , any any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech . And , I need t true eh , silence for that , because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant to eh , classify . The idea is to eh to use eh , I 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . phd c: And my idea is eh , it would be interesting to to have eh , a control set . And my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , silence without eh , any any noise . postdoc e: Which means that we 'd still You 'd hear the grad b: Yeah , fans . phd c: Eh , I  eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , professor d:   phd c: eh , eh , event eh , which , eh , eh , has , eh eh , a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the in the eh speech . grad b: So so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ? professor d:   phd c: Yeah , I have mark in in in in that Not in all in all the the file , grad b:   phd c: only eh , eh , nnn , mmm , I have eh , ehm I don't remind what is the the the the quantity , but eh , I I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones . I have , eh , two hundred and thirty , more or less , overlapping zones , and is similar to to this information , grad b: Whew !   phd c: because with the program , I cross the information of  , of Jane with eh , my my segmentation by hand . phd c: And the the idea is , eh , I I will use , eh , I want My idea is , eh , to eh to classify . phd c: I I need eh , the exact eh , mark of the different , eh , eh , zones because I I want to put , eh , for eh , each frame a label indicating . I I I put , eh , eh , for each frame a label indicating what is th the type , what is the class , eh , which it belong . phd c: Eh , the class you will overlapping speech \" overlapping \" is a class , eh , \" speech \" @ @ the class that 's grad b: Nonspeech . phd a: These will be assigned by hand ? phd c: a I I I ha I h I I put the mark by hand , phd a: Based on the  - huh . phd c: because , eh , my idea is , eh , in in the first session , I need , eh , I I need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , I I will cluster , is is right . Because , eh , eh , if not , eh , I will I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems , grad b: Well , training , and validation . And I I 'd prefer I would prefer , the to to have , eh , this labeled automatically , but , eh , eh , fro th I need truth . So , the difference between the top two , i So so I start at the bottom , so \" silence \" is clear . By \" speech \" do you mean speech by one sp by one person only ? phd c: Speech Yeah . postdoc e: So this is un OK , and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time , or or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or or clicking , overlapping with speech So , that that 's all those possibilities in the top one . phd c: Eh , in the first moment , because , eh , eh , I I have information , eh , of the overlapping zones , eh , information about if the , eh , overlapping zone is , eh , from a speech , clear speech , from a one to a two eh speaker , or three speaker , or is is the zone where the breath of a speaker eh , overlaps eh , onto eh , a speech , another , especially speech . postdoc e: So it 's basi it 's basically speech wi som with with something overlapping , which could be speech but doesn't need to be . phd c: No , no , es especially eh , overlapping speech from , eh , different eh , eh , speaker . Eh professor d: No , but there 's but , I think she 's saying \" Where do you In these three categories , where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ? \" phd c: Ah ! professor d: Which category do you put that in ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , he here I I put eh speech from eh , from , eh , one speaker without , eh , eh , any any any events more . postdoc e: Oh ! professor d: Right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ? phd c: Where ? Where What is the class ? professor d: Which catege which category ? postdoc e: Like a c phd c: No . phd c: For for the by the @ @ no , @ @ because I I I I want to limit the the nnn , the the study . grad b: Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those . phd c: \" Why ? Why ? What 's the reason ? \" because i it 's the first study . In the in the future , the the idea is to to extend the class , phd a: Is is phd c: to consider all the all the information , you you mentioned before professor d: Yeah . phd c: but eh , the the first idea Because eh , I don't know what hap what will happen with the study . i it 's pure phd a: What if there was a door - slam or something ? phd c: No , no , it 's pure silence . professor d: What you Well w I I think what you m I think what you mean is that it 's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises . professor d: Right ? Cuz you 're calling what you 're calling \" event \" is somebody coughing or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises . Right ? phd c: h here yet , yet I I I I I think I I think , eh , there are that some kind of noises that , eh , don't don't wanted to to be in that , eh , in that control set . phd c: But I prefer , I prefer at at the first , eh , the the silence with eh , this eh this kind of the of eh of noise . professor d: Right , it 's  , it 's \" Background \" might be might be a better word than \" silence \" . phd c: And , with this information The idea is eh , eh , nnn , I have a label for for each , eh , frame and , eh with a cluster eh algorithm I and postdoc e: Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . And eh I am going to prepare a test bed , eh , well , eh , a a set of feature structure eh , eh , models . phd c: I have to to test , but eh I phd a: You have your own ? phd c: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Is a modified version of of of a pitch tracker , eh , from , eh , Standar - eh Stanford University in Stanford ? No . phd a: Oh ! What 's it written in ? phd c: Eh , em , I I I don't remember what is the the name of the of the author , because I I have several I have eh , eh , em , eh , library tools , from eh , Festival and of from Edinburgh eh , from Cambridge , eh , and from our department . phd c: And And I have to because , in general the pitch tracker , doesn't work very well and grad b: Bad . This this is And th the idea is to to , eh , to obtain , eh , for example , eh , eh diff eh , eh , different well , no , a great number of eh FEC for example , eh , eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty thirty parameters , eh , for for each one . And in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data grad b: Supervised clustering . phd c: and the second is try to eh , to use some ideas eh , similar to the linear discriminant analysis . phd c: Eh ? Eh , similar , because the the idea is to to study what is the contribution of eh , each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters . What sort of classifier ar ? phd c: Eh , the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is eh is eh , similar , nnn , that the classifier used eh , in a quantifier vectorial quantifier is eh , used to to eh , some distance to to put eh , a vector eh , in in a class different . grad b: Unimodal ? phd c: Is Yeah ? W with a model , is is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity . grad b: So is it just one cluster per phd c: A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network . phd c: But eh what 's the p What is my idea ? What 's the problem I I I I see in in in if you you use the the neural network ? If w when this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm to can test , to can eh observe what happened you you can't you can't eh , eh put up with your hand in the different parameter , grad b: Right , you can't analyse it . phd c: but eh If you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . professor d: Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are . professor d: It 's hard to w w what you It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally . professor d: But it 's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs , especially if they 're all normalized . professor d: Well , this isn't tru if if if you really wonder what different if if phd c: Yeah . phd c: But professor d: Yeah , then a decision tree is really good , but the thing is here he 's he 's not he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth , grad b: Right . professor d: in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what what  phd c: And grad b: Right . professor d: I  , I think the other thing that one  , this is , I think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least See what I 'd I 'd Let me tell you what I would do . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , I would just take a couple . professor d: OK ? Like like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . professor d: OK , so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart . professor d: That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier . professor d: And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @ build a Markov model of some sort  , or or else have features that really are based on  on on some bigger chunk of time . But don't  anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know phd c: Yeah . professor d: what it 's doing , even You know it 's  , I think to know what it 's to have a better feeling for what it 's grad b: Yep . professor d: look at at som some picture that shows you , \" Here 's These things  ,  are offer some separation . \" And , in LPC , the thing to particularly look at is , I think is something like , the residual phd c: Yeah . S postdoc e: Can I ask ? It strikes me that there 's another piece of information  , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . phd c: I eh the the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two eh , w has eh several parts , several p objective professor d:   But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh I think you eh we have eh two main eh objective . And for that , if you don't use , eh , eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames , I think the Ike criterion or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change . When you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh em normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC . But eh eh I I understand that you your objective is to eh classify , to know that eh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone . because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose . phd c: you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm professor d:   phd c: because it 's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . phd c: A model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p  , will be possible the , eh the mark , the change and another another model will @ @ or several models , to try s but eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class . grad b: I 'm I 'm I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you what you said . What what model ? postdoc e:  phd c: Eh , the the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize , eh with eh to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer . phd c: And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net postdoc e: So p phd c: with the information we obtain from this eh this eh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to eh to put the class of each frame . phd c: you you eh , eh have obtained in the first eh , step with the for example , BIC eh , eh criterion compare model postdoc e:   phd c: And You I don't - u professor d: OK , but , I I think in any event we 're agreed that the first step is phd c: i postdoc e: Yeah . professor d: Because what we had before for for  , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps . professor d: So the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps . professor d: Right ? So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these  , in in in in grad b: Features ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , I again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too way too big . professor d: OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth twelfth - order  MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much . All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does . professor d: Whereas I think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things , or three of you have some very fancy display , and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on . professor d: Well , you 'll you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know , phd c: Yeah . professor d: so if you look at Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , and then you look at the third and there 's not and not too much there , you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , phd c: Yeah . professor d: right ? And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than than the other , maybe .  , and  on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , will say how well ,  the low - order LPC model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one . professor d: And so I i again , if you take a few of these things that are are prob  promising features and look at them in pairs , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of \" OK , I now have  , doing a bunch of these analyses , I now have ten likely candidates . phd c: but eh , eh eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to to do that and I would eh like to to know what eh , your opinion . Eh all this study in the f in the first moment , I I w I I will pretend to do with eh eh equalizes speech . grad b: With postdoc e: With what ? With what ? grad b: Right . phd c: Eh , why ? Because eh the spectral distortion is more eh a lot eh clearer , very much clearer if we compare with the PDA . phd c: fff ! Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh is is low . phd c: I don't know eh  i i that eh the the result of the of the study eh with eh with eh this eh this speech , the mix speech eh will work exactly with the eh PDA files . phd c: eh What , I  , what what is the effect of the low ' signal to to to noise relation , you know , eh with professor d: N u We Well , I think I think I think it 's not a it 's not at all unreasonable . It makes sense to start with the simpler signal because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway . professor d: And so , if you can get @ @  again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible  , features look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , and then collect ,  in pairs , and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed with a bigger classifier . professor d: And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much grad b: Right . Because it I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and And don't professor d:  . professor d: That 's well , the It it 's it 's true that it also , it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . phd c: I I I I think that the the eh parameter we found , eh , eh worked with both eh , speech file , postdoc e: That 's good . phd c: but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the PDA speech files . Is eh is not easy eh to to solve , because if you I I I have seen the the the speech file from eh PDA , and s some parts is very difficult because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram . phd c: Is very difficult to apply eh , eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see . Well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are  , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . phd a: Yeah , I maybe this is a dumb question , but w I thought it would be I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA professor d: Nah . phd a: because can't you , couldn't you like use beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ?  grad b: Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one . professor d: Yeah , no , you you 're you 're right grad b: But that 's professor d: that In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one and and so that 's phd a: Is that not allowed with this project ? professor d: well , no , we we don't have any rules , r really . professor d: I think I I think I think it 's it 's it 's a it 's an additional interesting question . professor d: I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one , because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two . professor d: if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . professor d: But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is . postdoc e: There there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the to the PDA , then some of the positional information goes away ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , it it it does , i it d it does , but the the the issue is that that phd a: No , it 's not it 's not that so much as postdoc e: And then , And if they 're on the access on the axis of it , that was the other thing I was thinking . postdoc e: He You mentioned this last time , that that if if you 're straight down the midline , then then the r the left - right 's gonna be different , grad b: Yeah , we hav need to put it on a little turntable , phd c: I I I I I th grad b: and phd a: Well , it 's phd c: Yeah . postdoc e: It seems to me that that it 's not a p  , you know , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated . phd a: I don't I don't know ho phd c: I I I think Sorry . I I I think because the the the distance between the two microph eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is very near . But it 's  from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea to to try to study the binaural eh problem eh , with information , because I I found difference between the the speech from from each micro eh , in the PDA . It - it 's not amplitude , postdoc e: Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves . postdoc e: But I 'm just I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the PDA , phd c: No . postdoc e: so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker . phd c: But professor d: That 's So so i @ @ I think the issue is , \" Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? \" phd a: Right . professor d: If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking , phd c: Yeah . phd a: So it 's sort of like how how confused is it about where the beam is . professor d: Yeah , is there a narrow Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern ? So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's it 's  , multiple people . OK , it just it just seemed to me that  , that this isn't the ideal type of separation .  , I I think it 's I can see the value o professor d: Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them , but  But the thing is just having two mikes If you looked at that thing on on Dan 's page , it was When when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different . phd a: Did - Sorry , b  I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . professor d: You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags . So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in in the lag . professor d: So if at whatever angle you are , at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the in in the cross - correlation value function . phd a: So so if there 's two grad b: And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks . postdoc e: Well , let me ask you , if if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ? phd c: Yeah . The - the Oh , I 'm sorry , postdoc e: No ? professor d: if they 're right next to one another ? phd a: If I was if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking , it wouldn't work . professor d: i i postdoc e: Next next one over n over on this side of the P PDA . postdoc e: Versus you versus you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one . grad b: Or or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either . Yeah , so it 's postdoc e: And so my point was just that it 's it 's gonna be differentially differentially varia valuable . postdoc e: it 's not to say  , I certainly think it 's extremely val And we we humans n n depend on you know , these these binaural cues . professor d: But it 's almost but it 's almost a I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . professor d: There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error  issue . professor d: If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it . and i and if there So it And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side professor d: if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . professor d: So if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough , experience with it to know how postdoc e: Yeah . postdoc e: Oh I 'm not I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . professor d: the other thing you can do  , if  , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA . And then you know then you 're sort of Yeah , then then you pretty much could cover phd a: Once you got two postdoc e: Interesting . phd a: Well what about just doing it from these mikes ? postdoc e: Interesting . phd c: It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the the the separation I I think professor d:  @ @ But - but that 's  , we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study . professor d: But but but the thing is , one of the at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA . phd a: That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , that 's that 's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were were were interested in . professor d: but you know if you can instrument a room , this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ? Some people at at  , yeah , at Brown and and and and at   and at Cape , grad b: Big micro @ @ arrays . phd a: Didn't they have something at Cape ? professor d: they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place grad b: Very finely . professor d: you know p tens of microphones , and and  phd a: Oh ! I saw a demo . professor d: And if you do that then you can really get very nice  kind of selectivity phd a: Yeah . grad b: Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array . phd a: And you could In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody . grad b: It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it . professor d: But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because  , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . And you can't just always go , \" well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up \" . phd a: No , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . phd a: It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA . grad b: But I think professor d: The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D grad b: Yep . professor d: and they communicate with each other ? And then You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that  , basically there wouldn't be any l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . grad b: Though All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , postdoc e: Interesting . grad b: not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of  multi - band as well . postdoc e: Ah ! phd a: I still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then grad b: But I think postdoc e: Well , you could have strips that you stick to your clothing . phd a: Hats ? grad b: In terms of the research th research , it 's really it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .  , I i I i I would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still get to the end of the , birthdays thing there . professor d: So grad b: Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out . grad b: One is , do we need to sign new these again ? postdoc e: Well , it 's slightly different . phd a: Are they new ? postdoc e: Cuz it it 's slightly different . professor d: Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to . grad b: Yeah , I I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed . grad b: I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing . postdoc e: I had to make one grad b: But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . postdoc e: Well , should I  I have some results to present , but  I guess we won't have time to do that this time . But it seems like  the anonymization is  , is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length .  , wha what postdoc e: If if we 're about to wind down , I think what I would prefer is that we  , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and I would like to present the results that I have on the overlaps . @ @ It sounds like u  , there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about . Why don't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly do them , and then and then and then and then and then we grad b: OK , go ahead , Jane . postdoc e: I 'd Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results . postdoc e: And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a you know , more that just a minute . postdoc e: I really do think that , because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself , you and I have discussed it previously , and there are different ways that people approach it , e and I think we should grad b: Alright . We 're we 're just We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it postdoc e: Well , OK . I I 'll give you the short version , but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes . postdoc e: OK , so the the short thing is  , we have  , tape recording  , sorry , digitized recor recordings . postdoc e: Now , in terms of like the transcript , the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name , and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says \" Hey Roger \" or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? grad b: No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping . postdoc e: OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned . Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we don't want postdoc e: I I don't think you understood what I what I said . postdoc e: So  , so in within the context of an utterance , someone says \" So , Roger , what do you think ? \" OK . Then , it seems to me that Well , maybe I  it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that . grad b: We don't we wanna we ha we want the transcript to be \" Roger \" . grad b: Because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that . postdoc e: OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have \" Roger \" be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was \" Roger \" be \" Frank \" , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . postdoc e: Now , if you want to , you know , in some cases , I I I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , actually did do  , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except professor d: Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . postdoc e: And and I cer and I So , the question then becomes one level back .  , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? Well , on the one hand , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions ,  and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like OK . On the other hand , this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name . However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names . postdoc e: So , is it really ,  You know ? grad b: Ugh ! postdoc e: Now , in terms of like so I I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name . Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . And someone who looked professor d: You can go , you know , \" Z \"  , for instance .  , yeah , t it doesn't  , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in in the in the transcript . postdoc e: Yeah , and and in the form that they sign , it does say \" your first name may arise in the course of the meetings \" . So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , \" Frank said this \" and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's \" Frank colon \" . grad b: Yeah , shoot ! professor d: Right ? postdoc e: Yeah , and and you know , even more i i  , immediate than that just being able to ,  Well , it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important . postdoc e: S i You know , \" You raised the point , So - and - so \" , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who \" you \" was . postdoc e: And ac and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , professor d: Yeah , I was too . Well , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . Well , I would sug I I don't wanna change the names in the transcript , phd c: Yeah . grad b: but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point . L let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the , what we 're covering in the meeting .  I realize when you 're doing this that   , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . So I think what would be helpful would be  , i and I 'll I 'll mention this to to Liz and Andreas too , that  , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any any , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll I 'll take the role of organizing them  , into into the agenda , postdoc e: OK . I 've no desire to to make it up , but if if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and  , and i ye yeah , I I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to  , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's There 's  , there 's obviously other things going on . grad b: How will we how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ? Do you know what I 'm saying ? phd a: \" The person who 's doing the transcript \" The IBM people ? grad b: Yeah .  , so so how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ? postdoc e: How do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? grad b: so if I 'm saying in a meeting , \" oh and Bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so \" , postdoc e: How do you mean ? phd a: They 're just gonna write \" Bob \" on it or do @ @ grad b: if you 're doing Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write \" Bob \" . If you 're if you 're doing discourse analysis , postdoc e: They won't be able to change it themselves . professor d: What ar how are they gonna do any of this ? grad b: Yeah , really . postdoc e: Well , I I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them . professor d: they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker  I I phd a: They can't do that . phd c: Yeah , I think grad b: Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity . phd c:  grad b: because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person . I think that My understanding from Yen Is it Yen - Ching ? Is that how you pronounce her name ? professor d:  Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . postdoc e: Oh ,  Yu - Ching ? Yu - Ching ? grad b: y Yu - Ching . postdoc e: was that  , they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down . But , you know , h they won't know these people , so I think it 's Well , they 'll they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified to them So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers . professor d: And it and it may very well be  , since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . professor d: And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . grad b: Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . phd c:  postdoc e: Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes . grad b: The p It 's a good point , \" which what do you do for discourse tracking ? \" phd c: Because y y you don't know to know , eh you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the of the speakers . If if if if someone says , \" what what is Jose doing ? \" and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding . postdoc e: Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit . You know ?  , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , @ @  , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . postdoc e: But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . phd a: But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting Or , you I think said , you know , or s Liz , said something about  , \" is Mari gonna use the equipment ? \"  , how would you say that ? postdoc e: Yeah ? phd a: you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef grad b: if you wanted to anonymize . Yeah , is professor d: \" Is you know who up in you know where ? \" phd a: Yeah . professor d: Right ? Use the phd a: I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , plus we 'd have to tell everybody else . grad b: Yeah , darn !  , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names . phd a: I I think the I think I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . grad b: Well , but that but that as I said , that that that works great for the acoustics , but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse . grad b: Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus their name that they 're being referred to . phd a: I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two grad b: Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and phd a: Why do you have to know his name ? professor d: OK , so suppose someone says , \" well I don't know if I really heard what  , what Jose said . professor d: So  u phd a: Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word \" Jose \" in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded . professor d: And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says \" speaker - five \" there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose , grad b: And that violates our privacy . professor d: and if were gonna do that we might as well give them \" Jose \" say it was \" Jose \" . postdoc e: Now , I I think that we have these two phases in the in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI . postdoc e: And within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not  change the to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to . postdoc e: And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . But I but I don that 's that 's a long way from now and and it 's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how grad b: Making some decisions ? postdoc e: i i it You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the  the audio , and just put in brackets \" speaker - one \" . phd c: the ? ? grad b: You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . professor d: I I think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and postdoc e: But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important . phd a: Well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any  For example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . phd a: If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , you know grad b: Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to still have it useful . grad b: But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names . professor d: She No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said \" Jose \" in their in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it . But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said \" Jose \" that you could replace it with \" speaker - seven \" . But I I also wanna say that people grad b: And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore . professor d: And th and the other thing is if if if Liz were here , what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , postdoc e: Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated . postdoc e: But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time . grad b: I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is . postdoc e: Well it Discourse , you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript . postdoc e: It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , and then you come directly into this confronting this problem . phd a: Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse , postdoc e: So . professor d: maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name . grad b: Did you read the paper on Eurospeech ? postdoc e: We could have little labels . I I I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again , which is everyone has like \" Mister White \" , \" Mister Pink \" , \" Mister Blue \" . Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ? They were di they they had the utterances . phd a: But so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous grad b: Everything was in the same order , but they were the individual syll syllables were played backwards . phd a: What did it sound like ? grad b: People had no difficulty in interpreting it . So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it . professor d: What , what does the speech recognizer care ? grad b: Ah , anyway . professor d: postdoc e: Oh , do we do digits ? Or ? What do we do ? grad b:  OK , we 'll quickly do digits . like as if you were talking like , \" nine eight six eight seven ? \" postdoc e: Well , you know , in the in the one I transcribed , I did find a couple instances I found one instance of contrastive stress , where it was like the string had a li So it was like \" nine eight two four , nine nine two four \" . So they were like looking ahead , postdoc e: And phd a: huh ? postdoc e: Well , they differed .  , I 've I am sort of interested in in And sometimes , you know , I s And I I never know . phd a: Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this postdoc e: and I phd a: They may as well throw in some interesting intonations "

        "Query": "Which groups were thanked for their efforts and discussed as being heavily impacted?",
        "Summary": "In recognition of their life-saving efforts during the ongoing pandemic, essential workers were thanked, particularly during Paramedic Services Week. Additionally, members voiced their support for various marginalized groups, including advocating for aboriginals facing police brutality, students experiencing disrupted education, indigenous and rural residents lacking internet access, and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "Article": "Item 2, then, this morning is an evidence session to scrutinise the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Claire Bennett, who is deputy director for curriculum and assessment. Thank you all for attending this morning, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so if it's okay, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking you what the main messages are that you've received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum. If I may, I think it's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been. So, there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement, knowledge and opportunity as possible. So, working through the regional consortia, approximately 120 separate events were organised, and we believe that in the region of 6,000 headteachers, teachers, governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in those events. We also held a number of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves, so that they could give us their feedback. We'll all be familiar, won't we, with the narrative of, 'Oh, we're sending people out into the world of business without the skills that we as an employer are looking for'. So we thought it was really important to engage business so that they can have their say and their input into the process. And obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their say. So, Members, I'm sure, will have been aware of the specific pages on Hwb that outlined the draft curriculum, and we had 275,000 unique visits to the Hwb curriculum pages. It's really interesting to see the breakdown of the areas of learning and experience\u2014which particular AoLEs were the most popular and were being looked at the most\u2014with our creative and performing arts and the creativity and the expressive arts being the most popular. So that's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular AoLE. What, then, have people said to us? Well, I'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing. There's real support for the need for change, because that's the first question, actually; why are we doing this, and why do we need to change? So, support for the need for change, and lots of support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum. Strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession\u2014so, the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities. In terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at, some of that is around some of the language used. Can we clarify, can we simplify in some areas, are there things that are repeated in a variety of AoLEs? Can we use that as an overarching, rather than repeating ourselves? Can we simplify it and clarify some of the language? Also, in some areas\u2014. It's interesting; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down, but in other areas, people say, 'Well actually, in this bit of it, we need a bit more detail, and a bit more depth and clarity'. That process has already started, but considering that this is a massive change, I have been hugely encouraged, actually, by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we're doing. Are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance? kirsty williams am: I think what's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession, we are doing it with our profession. So, in the spirit of co-construction, the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present.\u00a0So, Members will be aware that we've slightly changed the model. Pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward, and we've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools. But above and beyond the innovative schools, we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas, and they're the first part of that process. So, they met last week to begin looking at the feedback, and we'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine. Opportunities to do things better, explain things better, simplify where possible, where we've been told that that needs to happen, provide greater depth where we've been told that needs to happen\u2014absolutely. We're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those, but in terms of the overall concept, then no, no significant changes. And what are the steps now before the final curriculum is published in January 2020? kirsty williams am: Okay. We call them\u2014it's not a very nice name\u2014quality improvement practitioners, the QI practitioners. In October, there will be a number of workshops lasting three days at a time where those practitioners will continue that process of feedback with our curriculum and assessment group and all those people involved. By November, we would expect the QI groups to have completed their work and would want them to be in a position to hand over the refinements to an editorial process, and that has to be done in both languages. I think it's really important that we don't do it in English and then we simply translate it into Welsh. It also, then, hands over to the publication team to do all the work on the publication, our website team will then be working on it, and then we would expect final publication in January\u2014am I right, Claire? claire bennett: Yes. sian gwenllian am: You've touched on the point that there's going to be some sort of change, and you've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation. kirsty williams am: The original proposal that we began working on was, in the legislation, to provide for the four purposes\u2014so, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation\u2014as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects\u2014so, the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency\u2014as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory, so, for instance, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports. I've already made an announcement that I was going to put RSE on the face of the Bill. So, the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the Bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody\u2014. Rather than simply, in law, leaving it at the AoLE level, we'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters' statements within that, again, providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level. We'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas. So, there has been in the Chamber\u2014I can see Suzy is writing this down\u2014Suzy has asked me questions about, 'How do you create a national expectation around progression?' We've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process, so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out. One of the consistent worries that some people have had, whilst being very supportive of the overall aims, is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school, but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern. I set up a process\u2014this was an open process, and we were open to listening to people. So, I think those will be the two main areas where we hadn't originally thought that we would legislate for, but that we will now legislate for. I haven't got the 'what matters'\u00a0statements in front of me\u2014 kirsty williams am: Well, if you remember, we have the four purposes, and then we have the areas of learning and experience, and then, below the areas of learning and experience are the broad concepts that we would expect to be delivered in each of those areas of learning and experience. Some of the feedback that we've had is that\u2014 sian gwenllian am: So, will you be adding to those? kirsty williams am: Adding is not necessarily\u2014no, not adding. But, for instance, the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience. So, they'll be refined, but not added to, and then we will legislate for them, and that hadn't been the original intention. Will they include mental health and well-being? kirsty williams am: Well, the area of learning and experience for well-being is already there, and underneath that area of learning title, there are the broad concepts of what matters, what we believe matters, in that area of learning, and it is that that we will now actually put into the legislation. Sorry, I'm not helping, because I haven't got them with me either to read them out. lynne neagle am: They are in the annex to the paper, Si\u00e2n, and, obviously, mental health is in there. So, just to clarify, then, that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law. kirsty williams am: Yes, because the 'what matters' states very clearly the broad concepts in health and well-being. It refers to both physical and mental health, and we intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system. kirsty williams am: Claire, am I explaining it okay? claire bennett: Yes, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. So, the idea is to make sure that those are consistent, and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those, which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them. But the concept that you might not do one 'what matters'\u2014it was never what was intended. They won't be literally in the Bill, because, obviously, you might want to change the emphasis, so that'll be provided for in subordinate legislation, but the provision will be there, and they will have the status of something that's not optional, basically, for a school. sian gwenllian am: Therefore, it's not going to be on the face of the Bill\u2014the mental health aspect, for example. You're saying that it's subordinate, but then you're saying\u2014 kirsty williams am: So, on the face of the Bill, we will make provision to say that the 'what matters' statements have to be delivered. So the actual wording of the 'what matters' statements will be in secondary legislation; the need to deliver and the requirement, the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement, will be on the face of the Bill. If I think, if we had sat here 20 years ago, we probably, in a 'what matters' statement on health and well-being, wouldn't have referred to mental health, 20 years ago, because our understanding as a society, our willingness as a society to engage in that\u2014. So, if we had drawn up a 'what matters' statement even a decade ago, I suspect we wouldn't have talked about mental health. So, the concept of having to deliver the 'what matters' statement will be in the primary legislation; the actual wording, because otherwise if you wanted to change it you'd have to go through the entire process\u2014. The actual need and the compulsion, the expectation that you have to do that, will be on the face of the Bill. The point you've made is one that Government has made with other legislation prior to this, but can I just ask you to consider the worthiness, if you like, or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters' statements, the first round of those, in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course? The reason I ask this is just to explain to the population of Wales that there is certainty at the first step, bearing in mind that it will change over the years\u2014I completely accept that. But when you're amending primary legislation, you don't have to go through the whole process again\u2014you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that. kirsty williams am: Yes, as I said, I think we've demonstrated that we're listening to people, that there has been concern expressed about certainty and having a national approach on some of these issues, and we have taken steps to address that and we'll continue to reflect, but, crucially, we'll continue to reflect with our partners who are co-constructing this with us. And I think the important thing to remember is that it's not Ministers or civil servants that are necessarily drawing up these 'what matters' statements, it is practitioners themselves, guided by experts in the field that are not teachers, that have come up with these things. Obviously, the Bill will presumably come to this committee\u2014 kirsty williams am: We're assuming so. sian gwenllian am: Moving on, therefore, to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education, I understand that you've had numerous responses to the White Paper surrounding this particular area. What are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what's been said? kirsty williams am: Well, these two areas certainly have ensured that lots of people have responded. It's interesting that people are far more interested in what we may or may not do about these two subjects than maths, English, Welsh, science, but there we go; I guess it's the nature of the areas that we're talking about. With regard to religious education, we had a significant number of people that have expressed concerns about our approaches towards RE that were set out in the White Paper. There were very mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions included in that area of learning. Many people said that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger\u2014and in some cases exclusive\u2014focus on Christianity, as opposed to including other world religions and, indeed, non-religious views. There were people who thought that RE shouldn't be compulsory at all and therefore our proposals to ensure that RE was compulsory, people objected to that, on the other\u2014. Of those respondents that agreed that RE should be a compulsory part of the curriculum, or were neutral\u2014didn't express an opinion either way, but were neutral on the question\u2014the issues that they were bringing forward were: a need for learners, as they saw it, to be prepared to be part of a diverse and multicultural society. So, they wanted RE to be much more broad-based and encompassing of world views and world religions. They felt that that was an important part of preparing a young person to live in a world that is, as you say, diverse with people of different views living in it. There is certainly a need to modernise RE; some people perceived the current curriculum as a bit old-fashioned. And also there was much feedback on making sure that the profession was ready to deliver a renewed, modernised RE curriculum. So, those are the issues around religious education\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Can I just\u2014? Before you go on to the next section\u2014is there evidence that this was a co-ordinated lobby to present a particular view and what is your response going to be to this? Obviously, there are always going to be lobbies presenting particular viewpoints. Our role, as politicians, is to lead, obviously, isn't it? kirsty williams am: Yes. Claire, would you say that it was a co-ordinated response? claire bennett: It wasn't a campaign in the sense of it being completely consistent, but, certainly, I think people with a particular interest in this issues felt galvanised to respond to the White Paper on this issue\u2014on this one and on relationships and sex education. And your response? kirsty williams am: And my response: well, clearly, Si\u00e2n, I need to consider those responses, and both for RE and RSE, I shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues. With regard to RSE, the key messages, again, are focused on whether children should be taught RSE at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it shouldn't be a compulsory part of the curriculum\u2014that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education. There were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum. With regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum, there were strong views that, again, it should be parents, and parents alone, that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules. I think if we are to achieve the four purposes, and that's how we have always got to think about it, and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system\u2014how do we achieve those purposes? How are they healthy, confident individuals? How are we to prepare our children to be ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world? So, we will reflect on what has come back to us, but I do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum, if we are to achieve the four purposes. You've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. What is the timetable for the Bill itself and for seeking Royal Assent for that? kirsty williams am: Okay, so, as I said earlier, the expectation is that we will publish a final version of the curriculum in January 2020, so schools will then have the opportunity to be really engaging in it. I have to say, I'm in schools most weeks, and many, many, many schools are already taking the opportunity, even on the draft, to begin to think about planning and, indeed, changing what they're doing in schools. I'm overwhelmed, actually, by the enthusiasm of the sector to embrace what is a massive change for them. sian gwenllian am: \u2014actually implemented in September\u2014 kirsty williams am: In 2022. kirsty williams am: And I think what's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in January itself, because that's the bit that schools are really concerned about, and then we will have the process here to underpin it. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. hefin david am: Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? kirsty williams am: I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. And how do you respond, then\u2014? , it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? kirsty williams am: Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. hefin david am: What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. kirsty williams am: As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. hefin david am: So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. kirsty williams am: Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. hefin david am: Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' kirsty williams am: Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. hefin david am: It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? kirsty williams am: Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 hefin david am: Bridges have been built. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. hefin david am: I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. kirsty williams am: And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. hefin david am: And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. steve davies: As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. kirsty williams am: The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. hefin david am: When did that take place? kirsty williams am: Where? hefin david am: When. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 suzy davies am: This isn't about assessment. suzy davies am: So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? kirsty williams am: Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 suzy davies am: Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. steve davies: In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? claire bennett: I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. kirsty williams am: And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. suzy davies am: Can I just have a quick\u2014? lynne neagle am: Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? kirsty williams am: I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar. You touched on this briefly in response to some questions from Hefin David earlier on, but I'm just interested to know how the money that you announced for supporting teachers for the preparation of the implementation, how that's actually been used. What specifically have teachers been doing to prepare for its implementation? I know you've set aside about \u00a324 million over two years. kirsty williams am: You're right, first of all, it's not an insignificant amount; it's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. So, you're right that it is not insignificant, and it was a hard-won resource, I can tell you, from my colleagues. Because, as I said earlier, the curriculum itself can be amazing, but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it, then all this change will be for nothing. That money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we've just heard from Claire, there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain. There are other schools that maybe are only beginning now, now that it's published, to be really engaging with the curriculum. kirsty williams am: There is a national element to it, but we've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because I have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they're going to need. But we have worked with the National Academy for Educational Leadership to put together a programme for headteachers, and that's national. The regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants, and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics. Claire referred to the AoLE networks, and there's an opportunity then for people to engage in that. So, this September is the start of our new ITE courses, taught for the first time, and that's great. So, we're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support, again on a national basis, for those who are newly qualified, beginning their teaching career, because I don't think we've done that on a consistently good level across the country. We're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system. We're also involved in\u2014and I'm sure the committee has heard about it, so forgive me if I'm going over old ground\u2014schools as learning organisations and the OECD work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation. We know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong, strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system, and we've not been very good at that in Wales, we've not been strong at that, that's not the culture that we have had. We've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you're good or bad, rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about, 'What are we doing well and what do we need to improve on?' So, the schools as learning organisations are an important part, again, so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the OECD. And the money that you announced for this\u00a0\u00a0professional development preparation, if you like, was for two years. So, there's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development, as well as anything else. But is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues? Or do you see what you've put in as being, 'This is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation. The rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that'? kirsty williams am: The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and, clearly, I continue to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning, and I'm sure this committee and, indeed, members of this committee could help me in that task. Can you tell us a bit about the innovation schools\u2014the 16 innovation schools\u2014and how you've made your decisions about who they might be, across which sectors, in primary, secondary and so on? So, basically, how they were selected and what you're expecting of them. So, all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase, which is innovation schools, and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within Welsh Government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us, going forward. I think one of the lessons learned, and this was said in the committee, was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools, but there was a downside to having pioneer schools, and I think, at this stage of the game, we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now\u2014everybody had to be a pioneer\u2014because this is coming down the track and we don't want anybody just sitting there waiting until September 2022 and saying, 'Oh, gosh. So, the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we've all got to engage in this now. The innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement, and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues. It was important that we engaged with the regions to get their view, and we've had evaluation being carried out\u2014 claire bennett: Yes. So, during the first term of work, we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole\u2014so, take the whole curriculum guidance and then think, 'How would I apply that in the school?, Does it make sense?, Can we work with it?, What are the issues?, What are the questions that arise for us for assessment?', and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on, 'If I were putting this into practice\u2014'. So, it's slightly different to the feedback we've had from other people, which has been more, 'Maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording' and kind of quite practical, and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school. That's been drawn together into an overall report, drawing out the themes, by Wavehill, who are a kind of research company. Having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable, in just making us think, even with all the practitioners that have been involved, 'How do we make this work for schools?', given that we've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically. So, it's been invaluable, and they're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically. kirsty williams am: If you think of the pioneer model, pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. So, you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being, or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum. This is about, at this stage, where we have a high degree of certainty about what it's going to look like, 'Actually, how do I as a school practically implement this in the round?', and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that. But also we did need a mix of sector\u2014secondary, primary\u2014but also linguistically, to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we've got. So, just trying the practical implementation now, now that we know exactly\u2014not exactly\u2014 but we have a good idea what it's actually going to look like, so, 'How am I going to go about doing this?' lynne neagle am: Okay. If I could ask as well, maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools. sian gwenllian am: Are you confident that every school across Wales is participating in this process of change now, because the danger is, in getting these pioneer schools\u2014? I understand that they are discussing in clusters, and so on, but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now? steve davies: I can't tell you that, absolutely, 100 per cent are definitely, totally, absolutely equally involved. The structure we've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually\u2014not readiness to engage\u2014start to deliver as we move through to the future. And we don't have a roll-call against all schools, but we require them, or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks. Every school is part of a network that links to it, and they gauge (1) the level of activity in it, (2) the outcomes of that work, because each of the networks, each of the clusters, produces work that the region brings together. What I would say, and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to Scotland, I think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this, it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver. dawn bowden am: I just wanted to clarify, because in your paper you talk about giving \u00a330,000 to each, or to the innovation schools. Was that \u00a330,000 each, or \u00a330,000 for the project? kirsty williams am: Each school that participates in the innovation schools programme gets \u00a330,000. My final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in Wales. So, teachers trained in England apply for jobs in Wales, but they obviously haven't been trained in the new curriculum. Well, you're right\u2014we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in Wales will teach in England and teachers trained in England or who have worked in England will come across the border, as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools. Indeed, when I'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues, I think Wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals, as well as an exciting new curriculum. So, I think, actually, potentially, we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it'll be a great place to be a professional. So, our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system. Clearly, there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with, but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system, because we've just talked about the two years' worth of money; in an ideal world, if I was able to make long-term plans, I think there will be an ongoing, and there should always be an ongoing, provision for professional learning in our classrooms. And this shouldn't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets. One of the ways in which I think we can attract teachers to Wales is to send a very clear message\u2014 and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession, wherever they train\u2014that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning. dawn bowden am: So, you'll still be recruiting on the basis of skills and adaptability and so on. We've got a lot of issues to cover, so I'm going to appeal for concise questions, concise answers. What was the feedback like with regard to the draft assessment proposals? lynne neagle am: Excellent, concise question. We received what I would describe as positive feedback regarding the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment that is there to support children's learning and progression. Key messages were perhaps to find a better way of expressing the purposes of assessment\u2014we refer to a formative and summative assessment\u2014and just being a bit clearer about what that actually means and being clear about definitions around it. suzy davies am: Obviously, we're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well. Presumably, the way you're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate, and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be\u2014. They're out in a separate document; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document\u2014is that right? There's a thick black line between these two concepts. I think some of the trouble that we've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability, and, when you start using assessment for accountability purposes, that's when, potentially, that assessment process gets corrupted and you have gaming. suzy davies am: Can I ask, with the assessments, though, which is about pupil progression, will those results be published internally? Will parents get to see those? kirsty williams am: Oh, yes. The primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents, whether they're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment. So, absolutely, you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods, whichever type they use, with parents, to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child. Is it realistic, then, to expect parents, families, communities, not to think about that information when they're drawing conclusions about the school, notwithstanding that formal evaluation of those schools is going to be done completely separately? kirsty williams am: Well, of course, parents will always be interested in how the overall institution is doing. But the conversations I have with parents, and I certainly feel this myself as a parent\u2014I'm interested in how my child is doing, how my child is getting on in school, what are the issues that that child has, and, more importantly, what is the school going to do about it? So, if my child is struggling for whatever reason, what is the school going to do about that to help that child? If my child happens to be exceptionally able and talented, how are you as a school going to make the most of my child's talents and move them on to fulfil their potential? So, undoubtedly, I can't control assumptions that parents will make, but it is absolutely clear in this system, and my intention is, that teachers should share assessment methods and outcomes with parents to have that conversation about what happens next. But I am absolutely clear that we do have to make this distinction between assessment for learning and an accountability in the system, otherwise we drive\u2014inadvertently; people don't set out to do it, but we drive a set of behaviours that has negative unintended outcomes. So, how\u2014? Can you just briefly give us an indication of how you think the accountability, on both sides of that thick black line\u2014the methodology\u2014is likely to change with this? You mentioned that there's going to be an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly; we know that some of the existing ones have been ditched in fairly recent legislation. Without pre-empting the findings of such a review, have you got your top three likely expected changes? kirsty williams am: To accountability? suzy davies am: Yes. Well, we're moving to a system of schools as learning organisations, and a greater emphasis on self-evaluation, with external verification of that by Estyn, our inspectors. suzy davies am: And that will be reflected in the school categorisation system as well\u2014will those indicators change, do you think? kirsty williams am: Well, categorisation\u2014again, the purpose for categorisation is not to make a judgment on a school in the sense of a league table; it's a triage process, categorisation. kirsty williams am: Well, this is the issue, isn't it? This is the problem of designing a system where there are perfectly good reasons to introduce the system\u2014and in this case it's a triage system to identify levels of support for a school. And categorisation was never intended to be a way of expressing a league table of school performances; it's there to identify levels of support that a school can expect from its regional consortia. Now, we have, we have\u2014we will continue to keep categorisation, but, since coming into office, we have tried to adapt categorisation simply away from pure data to a more formative assessment process, and categorisation will continue to evolve. And the first level of accountability in that system has to be the professionalism of an individual member of staff\u2014the moral purpose that I bring to my classroom today to do right by the children that are in front of me. That's the first part of our accountability regime\u2014the moral purpose our professionals bring to their work. Well, just finally on that, there may be an argument, then, for scrapping categorisation, putting something else in place. But I suppose the core question is: how are the general public going to understand all those things that you've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach, the leaders being able to lead, and how well a school is performing against KPIs on those measures? kirsty williams am: Well, because we will still\u2014. kirsty williams am: Yes, that's the ultimate, isn't it? So, the ultimate is\u2014. The ultimate system that we're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in Estyn. Because I get the point of the end point being Estyn, and that's where the public assurance will be seen, but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards? Where will we see those demonstrated? kirsty williams am: Well, you would expect to see those demonstrated in the self-evaluation that a school will provide of itself, and then Estyn\u2014 suzy davies am: All right, so schools will be publishing self-evaluations annually, or something like that? kirsty williams am: Yes, schools\u2014 steve davies: The outcome of the self-evaluation is a school development plan. steve davies: We expect a series of priorities for a school to set itself as a result of prioritisation. What we're looking at, in terms of what's brought to that, is not a narrow set of measures\u2014just two measures, or one measure in a secondary school. The measures will still consider reflection on progress of children, but it'll also have reviews of mental health, well-being, how it approaches that and things that it wanted to do. The school is evaluating\u2014the outcome of that will be a development plan, annually published on the website. kirsty williams am: And the schools' ability\u2014whether they do that well or whether they don't do it well\u2014will be judged by Estyn. lynne neagle am: Okay, as my colleague Chair Dai Lloyd would say, 'Now we're into the needing serious agility territory'. Firstly from me: Qualifications Wales have told us that the curriculum must define qualifications rather than the other way around. What implications does that have for the amount of time that is needed to develop qualifications that are properly aligned with the new curriculum? kirsty williams am: Well, I'd absolutely agree with Qualifications Wales. The qualifications have to arise out of the curriculum, and the qualifications should not be dictating the curriculum. Qualifications Wales, which I met with yesterday, I think\u2014yes, yesterday; it seems a long time ago\u2014will begin their national conversation about reform of qualifications as a result of curriculum reform in November. How is awareness and understanding of human rights, including children\u2019s rights, being embedded in the new curriculum? kirsty williams am: Children's rights, human rights\u2014they've been key considerations throughout the design, and this is currently set out in overarching guidance and we continue to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And I'm delighted that the children's commissioner took the time to write to me during the feedback phase to say that they were very pleased that their initial assessment demonstrates that what we're proposing is a big step forward. And how do you respond to the concerns expressed in the children's commissioner\u2019s quarterly report of July 2019 that consultation materials for young people were not released until mid June, allowing just over a month for young people to engage? And they said it was disappointing that a plan was not in place at the start of the consultation period. kirsty williams am: Well, we undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people, as I said at the beginning. We had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and we had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning. It's a powerful contribution and I think will actually effect change, especially in how the 'what matters' statements are worded. sian gwenllian am: Turning to the Welsh dimension in the new curriculum, the Learned Society of Wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource? kirsty williams am: We have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum. It's one of the conversations I had with Qualifications Wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we've had previously, where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications aren't available. So, we're already having those conversations with Qualifications Wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum. And, in terms of the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language, how are progression steps and achievement outcomes in Welsh-medium schools going to work and how are they going to work in English-medium schools? kirsty williams am: Okay. Just on the Welsh dimension, I think it's really important that whatever resources we have to support the Welsh dimension are really, really, really broad and not confined to specific areas. I was in Swansea University just this week, looking at some of their Technocamp work that they're doing to help us with coding, and we had an amazing conversation about the Welsh contribution to the computing industry. And so my expectation is that that isn't taught in a history lesson\u2014that, actually, when children are learning about coding, they get to hear that Welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology. When I talk about a Welsh dimension,  right the way across the curriculum, and I think that's important. The continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught. We have to recognise that, and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language, and they have to be contextualised. We recognise that children learning Welsh in a Welsh-medium school, their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker, and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning Welsh in an English-medium school. Vice versa\u2014we've had this discussion before\u2014if a child is going into Welsh medium, their progression in English perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an English-medium school, although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position. So, we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school, but recognising that it is a progression. sian gwenllian am: With regard to the creative thinking element of PISA, I take it that you are adhering to the fact that the Welsh Government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to PISA 2020. I don't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking. So, why not participate in these tests? kirsty williams am: Because, for me, the key factor for making that decision, and I intend to stick to it, is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Okay, so it's the timing. sian gwenllian am: So, later on, maybe when this is embedded\u2014 kirsty williams am: I think there could well be a different decision at a later date, but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it. Can I just say? In terms of creativity, Wales is seen as an exemplar by the OECD, especially our partnership with the Arts Council of Wales and creative learning through the arts. That's why I don't understand why we're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the PISA. kirsty williams am: There could well be a different decision, but for 2021 we're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with. I just don't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system. We are seen as exemplars by the OECD\u00a0and some of the work that's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally. sian gwenllian am: So, you'll think about it for the next round of PISA. kirsty williams am: Oh gosh, that shows that Si\u00e2n thinks that I'll be here to make that decision. Countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it, and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this. janet finch-saunders am: Can you give a guarantee that all children and young people, where appropriate, will take part in physical activity under the new curriculum for Wales? Also, how much time per week will the Government expect children and young people to spend undertaking physical activity? kirsty williams am: Yes, all children will be given that opportunity, because if they are not then that school would be in breach of the expectations that will be set out in statute. janet finch-saunders am: How will you monitor it? kirsty williams am: Again, Janet, I don't go around monitoring schools now. As we've just said\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: How will you ensure that every child has that opportunity? kirsty williams am: Well, as we've just said, ultimately, we are not getting rid of our school improvement services and regional consortia, nor are we getting rid of Estyn. So, one would expect the quality of the curriculum to be a key consideration of any visit that Estyn would make to a school. To what extent will the new curriculum allow for the continuity of the way that the foundation phase is taught? Will there be any significant differences and have the early years professionals been involved in the development of the curriculum to date? kirsty williams am: Yes, early years professionals have been involved in the curriculum to date. One of the advantages, I think, of the new curriculum is to take the pedagogical principles that underpin our approach to early years education actually further into children's educational journey. We have a certain pedagogical approach until the age of seven, and then all of a sudden, at seven, it's like, 'Forget all of that now. Sit down, pick up your pen and do this.' That's been really uncomfortable for many practitioners in our primary sector. So, actually, yes, statutory and non-statutory provision have been involved in the development of the curriculum because, of course, some of this is going to be delivered in the non-statutory sector. I'm very welcoming and supportive of that, but those pedagogical principles will now be available throughout that child's educational journey, rather than the false divide we've got at the moment. suzy davies am: So, aside from the purposes and the AoLEs, the type of teaching is unlikely to change in the foundation phase settings. The other end of the scale now: you report that one of the themes of the feedback from further education has been the need to ensure that the transition to post-16 education is supported so that the systems don't just clash against each other. How are you working on the sector at the moment to make sure that there's a decent dovetail? kirsty williams am: Okay. We don't want to do anything in pre-16 that stops people going on to be successful in post-16, whichever route the child or young person decides to take. FE have been involved in every single AoLE and they're a part of the curriculum and assessment group. And then in the conversations we had yesterday with Qualifications Wales around what qualifications will look like, I was very keen to take the opportunity to emphasise that any changes to qualifications should be a gateway to further study in FE, whichever type of route the child took. suzy davies am: And you're confident they're geared up to accepting young people who have been educated in this way. sian gwenllian am: I think you actually answered this at the beginning, but just to confirm that you're carrying on with the same governance set-up, the different groups that you've got, and there's nothing being added there or taken away. And just finally from me, then, on pupil referral units: what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, we've been taking advice from Brett Pugh, who chairs the education otherwise than at school improvement group, and this has been an area where we've had to think really, really, really, really, really hard. So, what we intend to do for EOTAS and PRU is to set a minimum of what we would expect a child to receive. So, that would be around the four purposes; that would be around the cross-cutting themes of literacy, numeracy and digital competency and health and well-being. After that, then there needs to be a discussion and a focus on what is in the best interests of that particular pupil. One of the things we know about sometimes in EOTAS is we have very able and talented students who don't get access to the range of qualifications and courses that they have the capability and the aptitude to do. We also have to consider, though, that for some children they may be out of school for reasons, and telling them that they've got to do a full curriculum may be hugely detrimental to their mental health and well-being. So, for instance, to give an example, you could have a child who's very ill, and saying to them, 'You have to carry the full load of a curriculum' could be inappropriate. So, we'll be setting a minimum standard, as I said, around the purposes, around the cross-cutting themes and health and well-being, and then there will be an expectation that in conjunction with the child and the family an appropriate addition would be put in place to meet the needs of that child, recognising that they could have very different needs. Is that clear? lynne neagle am: Well, yes, and it's something that we'll probably look to build on when we look at our inquiry on EOTAS, which is coming up. So, can I thank you for attending and thank your officials for coming today? As usual, we will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for your attendance this morning. As Members will see, there are a substantial number of papers to note\u201423 in total, which are in a supplementary pack. As there are so many, can I suggest that we note them all together and then we've got an opportunity to return to some of them in the private session afterwards? Is that okay with everybody? Okay. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content?"

        "Query": "Summarize the difficulties faced by secondary schools in carrying out curriculum reform, the opinions on support or changes of circumstances, the stress faced by the oil and gas industry, and the discussion about restoring Canadian businesses during the pandemic. Additionally, provide insights on the perspectives of Heather McPherson and Chrystia Freeland on restoring Canadian businesses during the pandemic.",
        "Summary": "Despite some primary schools having surplus funds, many secondary schools are facing deficits and a lack of funds. Additionally, there is a shortage of teachers with appropriate training. Concerns arise regarding the ability of lower-tier schools to adapt to the new curriculum and improve teaching quality. The approach to students has not changed, but individual circumstances may require adjustments from the Student Loans Company. Challenges in service delivery may arise due to staff shortages caused by illness, self-isolation, or adherence to social-distancing measures. Early monitoring was implemented due to the presence of campuses and activities in China and Southeast Asia. The oil and gas industry has been heavily impacted by anti-oil and gas lobby groups, resulting in the introduction of bills that restrict major projects and oil shipping. These actions have caused a significant decline in investment and a recession in the Alberta economy. Members express concerns about the government's handling of pandemic-related restrictions, particularly in relation to reopening businesses and providing effective stimulus. They emphasize the need to reopen fishing, restore agricultural supply chains, and support farmers. Questions are raised about the government's response to outbreaks in meat-packing plants and the provision of financial support to workers in unsafe conditions. The government is also questioned about providing pandemic relief funds to businesses utilizing tax havens. Hon. Chrystia Freeland acknowledges the hard work of farmers and emphasizes the importance of a safe working environment, trusting the Food Inspection Agency to regulate conditions.",
        "Article": "I've received apologies for absence from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Si\u00e2n today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb\u00a0digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas? kirsty williams am: Thank you, Dawn. So, you're\u00a0absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could\u2014? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. steve davies: In short, the new purpose is to meet the needs of particular groups of children and young people. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but I think it's really encouraging that in my discussions yesterday\u2014I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities\u2014some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently\u2014I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday. So, Monday will be a challenge for some, and not all will be delivering it, but we will be working so that we can get as much as possible delivered for those groups over the next two weeks, and particularly to have resilient programmes post Easter for the groups of children in those three categories that I said. Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. kirsty williams am: In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs. steve davies: I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place. I'm working with Albert Heaney my colleague, the director for social services, who is meeting with the 22 directors of social services today to look to ensure that we are joined up in ensuring none of these children fall through the gap. hefin david am: A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents? kirsty williams am: We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying, 'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.' So, schools are already taking the initiative and having those conversations with parents about what their needs will be. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. suzy davies am: Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services' care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need. kirsty williams am: We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children? Because that's not there normally, is it, except in separate\u2014 kirsty williams am: We do find ourselves in a strange situation. My understanding is what we're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange, 'You get this for two weeks, then you don't get it for two weeks, and then you're back in.' My understanding is, in England, that is what they're going to do. We're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It won't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks. helen mary jones am: Just briefly, building on Suzy's question, one particular group of children and young people that I hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers. For some of them, they may not be able to come into school because the people they're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions. But I think that, for other young carers, coming to school is an absolute lifeline, because they're working at home. So, I don't know if it's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities, but it's a group of young people who, again, may not be vulnerable in other ways, but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school. And the other group\u2014and this, I suppose, goes back to Suzy's point about teachers knowing their young people\u2014is the children who may be living in situations where they're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse. Again, these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services, but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be. So, again, I'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools. If a teacher is worried about what a child's circumstances are like at home, whether they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the\u2014. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. We've all got a role to play, and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission. We need to send a really clear message that you're all part of the solution, and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak. helen mary jones am: I'm sure that that's true, but I'm sure that we wouldn't be wanting a child who's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad\u2014. janet finch-saunders am: Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses. lynne neagle am: Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance. dawn bowden am: Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this\u2014and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that\u2014the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying, 'Well, what's going to happen to that?' Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff? steve davies: Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation\u2014and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear\u2014is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing. dawn bowden am: So, would you anticipate\u2014again, I know this is all a bit 'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable\u2014that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the context of teaching staff, teaching assistants, but we're also having discussions with local authorities, and I met with the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services this week, to look at deploying youth workers, to look to be deploying other staff that the local authority may employ, like sports development officers. Welsh Government will be talking with a range of our partners who perhaps their normal activities can't continue at the moment, but actually have personnel who want to add to this effort, who want to be able to be part of a provision going forward in the longer term, to be able to provide a great place for children to be. Let's think about it, in these worst of times, we're asking parents to leave their children so that they can go and do essential work, and some of that essential work is putting themselves at risk, potentially. And we want to give those parents confidence that, when they leave their child with us, that child will receive something really worthwhile, and they can direct all of their attention to doing their job. Janet, have you got a supplementary on schools now, not on early years settings? janet finch-saunders am: I lost the signal before, so it's a little bit confusing at this end, so bear with me. Just in terms of the closure of schools, I have been asked by teachers what does new purpose\u2014you may have covered it, but bear in mind [Inaudible.]\u2014mean in practice. And also, they're already asking what will next\u2014? I know you said earlier that next week could look and probably will look significantly different than this week, but what can they expect to be happening next week in terms of this new purpose work? lynne neagle am: We've covered that, Janet. kirsty williams am: First of all, Janet, I just want to say thank you very much for your kind comments. lynne neagle am: I think you're having trouble hearing us, aren't you, so I think\u2014? janet finch-saunders am: No, I heard that loud and clear. lynne neagle am: But I think you missed the earlier comments, when we went into some detail on the new purpose of schools. dawn bowden am: Just in relation to special schools and how they will fit into this new purpose arrangement. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. steve davies: I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we\u2019ll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school. It\u2019s likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that\u2019s the right thing to do? kirsty williams am: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about. steve davies: The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future. dawn bowden am: We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again? kirsty williams am: If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage? kirsty williams am: Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses\u2014people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that we will continue to pay for childcare, delivered under the childcare offer even when a child is unable, or a parent is unwilling, to take up that place. So, if that setting is receiving a childcare payment from the Welsh Government as part of our childcare offer, that will be paid, regardless of whether that child attends or not. And I know that we're also working with local authorities to ensure a similar position on Flying Start childcare and early education. It's also important that childcare settings will be able to apply for the various packages of support that are being made available by my colleague, Ken Skates. hefin david am: Yes, I'd just like to turn that around from the parents' point of view. With schools closing, there are a lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care. kirsty williams am: Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially\u2014and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan. janet finch-saunders am: Is this the Cylch question? lynne neagle am: Yes, please. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns\u2014[Interruption.] lynne neagle am: We've lost Janet. kirsty williams am: I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014 around service-level agreements are off. [Laughter.] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. lynne neagle am: If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams? kirsty williams am: Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next. janet finch-saunders am: Yes, I think I raised it yesterday, Kirsty, but you were receiving loads of questions. I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me\u2014do you have any advice for them? kirsty williams am: Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade\u2014I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason\u00a0that is. So, just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you're talking about. And, of course, you are right to say that, because we have got some elements of external moderation here, those factors may be less for us in Wales than they might for colleagues in England. kirsty williams am: Yes, I think we are starting at a different base, thank goodness. As I said, students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they're GCSE students. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me\u2014 because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working\u2014how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation process. It may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting. Secondly, you mentioned the AS-levels, of course, as being of value at the moment, but we've got people in Year 12 who now won't be doing their ASs. Is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do? Will they be doing two sets of exams next year, for example? Or is AS just off the table? In which case, how are the A2s going to be calculated in due course? And then, finally from me, we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well\u2014your BTECs, and I think it's the Association of Accounting Technicians, which is a lot of computer-based learning\u2014which is due to be examined within three weeks. I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess? kirsty williams am: With regard to\u00a0AS-levels\u2014no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies\u2014they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board\u2014and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you. suzy davies am: Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. suzy davies am: \u2014is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments? kirsty williams am: Well, potentially, as I said. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades. lynne neagle am: And, just before we move on, have the universities across the UK indicated that they are content with this approach going forward\u2014content to accept students on this basis? kirsty williams am: Certainly. There have been discussions with universities and UCAS, of course, that this also has a bearing on. And the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we've factored in to making these decisions. Those discussions with universities are ongoing, aren't they, Huw? huw morris: Yes. So, we've been in regular conversation with Universities Wales and through them with Universities UK and we've received every indication that the approach that's been adopted here has been welcomed by the institutions. Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide? kirsty williams am: Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions\u2014a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question. Universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them. Colleges are in a similar position, looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, does give us more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector. suzy davies am: I might ask you about that in a minute, because I don't even know what the Bill says yet. kirsty williams am: Huw, I don't know if there's anything you want to add. huw morris: No\u2014just to confirm what's been said and also to add in that independent training providers, similarly autonomous, like colleges and universities, have been moving in the same direction. We've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. We've got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis. huw morris: That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are\u2014in your portfolio. helen mary jones am: Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it? And you don't get your EMA if you don't turn up. Should we take from your last answer that that attendance qualification doesn't apply anymore? kirsty williams am: Yes. They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault. helen mary jones am: No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention? kirsty williams am: Yes. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment? kirsty williams am: Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration. helen mary jones am: Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home\u2014 kirsty williams am: It is their home. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students' basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need? kirsty williams am: Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that. huw morris: We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners. And on this specifically\u2014last question from me\u2014 have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed? huw morris: So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone? kirsty williams am: Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure\u2014which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at\u2014we would expect school staff\u2014well-being staff, for instance in school\u2014to be doing check-ins\u2014phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people\u00a0a range of online facilities that are available\u2014so, for instance, Meic website\u2014so, looking to use a variety of platforms. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children their access to their counsellor is\u00a0via their school. We know that, and we're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists\u2014online counselling tools that children already use because they don't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor. They're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue, as far as possible, those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered, and their worries. One of the reasons, again, that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible\u2014and teachers have been working so hard to do that\u2014is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we've needed and wanted to maintain. Children will have worries about their own health; they'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves. So, we need to understand, and I think we will also have to recognise, that this support will have to be ongoing once we're back to normal, and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience. They are incredibly resilient, and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages. They are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands' and things like that than even adults have been. So, they are incredibly resilient, but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them. helen mary jones am: Can I just\u2014? Just a supplementary to that\u2014you've mentioned already, Kirsty, the importance of youth services, and, particularly thinking voluntarily youth services, you've given the commitment, when were talking about Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin earlier, that services that are part-funded by grants through the Welsh Government, for example, thinking of the national youth voluntary service\u2014will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well? Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time? kirsty williams am: No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public\u2014 helen mary jones am: Because it's not safe. kirsty williams am: \u2014because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying, 'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.' lynne neagle am: Okay, thank you. The normal rules of engagement have to change and, those organisations, we'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal, and we wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that. When we're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children, they have a valuable role to play and I know that local government and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services are already in discussion about how youth services\u2014. Those traditional youth clubs, because of austerity, are not necessarily there anymore, so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work, and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals\u2014if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point? kirsty williams am: I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't\u2014 hefin david am: Can we have a clear line on that? kirsty williams am: We don't want to jeopardise anybody, but as I said, some of the normal services are simply not available as everybody turns their attention to trying to respond to the pandemic. Final question\u2014because I know that the Minister's got a lot of things that she needs to get on with\u2014from Suzy on emergency legislation. suzy davies am: I'm not going to ask you if you'll use any powers you get under the emergency legislation, but are you able to give us some indication of what they might be? kirsty williams am: Sure. For instance, the Bill will provide Welsh Ministers with powers to temporarily close schools or other educational institutions, childcare premises; powers to give temporary continuity direction\u2014so, actually, the other way around, force things to be open\u2014and to be able to direct resources. So, that includes, as I said, I could direct something to stay open if that institution was trying to close down. The powers also give flexibility to maybe be able to direct staff to other institutions that they would not normally work in, if that was part of our resilience needs. We'd also be looking at, for instance, relaxing requirements around ratios in childcare settings, or we might be wanting to do things around food. If there is a continuing role for schools in providing food, we might have to be a bit more flexible about what that might look like. So, those kinds of flexibilities\u2014to be able to suspend things, direct things\u2014that we would not normally have in normal circumstances. And just to finish this one off\u2014you may not be able to answer this one, in all fairness\u2014in those situations where it's the Government who says 'no' to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely? kirsty williams am: I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. kirsty williams am: It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this\u2014it feels like an awfully long time ago now\u2014 you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion. kirsty williams am: So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago. suzy davies am: I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked. kirsty williams am: Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We do recognise what an incredibly challenging time this is, and we'd like to place on record our thanks to all of you for the work that you're doing to try and see us through this crisis. Item 3, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting"
